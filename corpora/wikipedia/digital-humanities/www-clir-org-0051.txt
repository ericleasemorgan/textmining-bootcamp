Full Text of Main Report >>

This report culminates two years of work by CLIR staff involving extensive interviews and site visits with scholars engaged in international research collaborations involving computational analysis of large data corpora. These scholars were the first recipients of grants through the Digging into Data program, led by the NEH, who partnered with JISC in the UK, SSHRC in Canada, and the NSF to fund the first eight initiatives. The report introduces the eight projects and discusses the importance of these cases as models for the future of research in the academy. Additional information about the projects is provided in the individual case studies below (this additional material is not included in the print or PDF versions of the published report).

Report Recommendations:

1) Expand our concept of research

2) Expand our concept of research data and accept the challenges that digital research data present

3) Embrace interdisciplinarity

4) Take a more inclusive approach to collaboration

5) Address gaps in training

6) Adopt models for sharing credit

7) Adopt models for sharing resources

8) Re-envision scholarly publication

9) Make greater, sustained investments in human and cyberinfrastructure

 

Case Studies:

	Introduction
	Using Zotero and TAPOR on the Old Bailey Proceedings: Data Mining with Criminal Intent (DMCI)
	Digging into the Enlightenment: Mapping the Republic of Letters
	Towards Dynamic Variorum Editions (DVE)
