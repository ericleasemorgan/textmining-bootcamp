She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, but only for one year. Throughout her life, she seldom left her home and visitors were few. The people with whom she did come in contact, however, had an enormous impact on her poetry. She was particularly stirred by the Reverend Charles Wadsworth, whom she first met on a trip to Philadelphia. He left for the West Coast shortly after a visit to her home in 1860, and some critics believe his departure gave rise to the heartsick flow of verse from Dickinson in the years that followed. While it is certain that he was an important figure in her life, it is not clear that their relationship was romantic\u2014she called him \"my closest earthly friend.\" Other possibilities for the unrequited love that was the subject of many of Dickinson\u2019s poems include Otis P. Lord, a Massachusetts Supreme Court judge, and Samuel Bowles, editor of the Springfield Republican.By the 1860s, Dickinson lived in almost complete isolation from the outside world, but actively maintained many correspondences and read widely. She spent a great deal of this time with her family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was actively involved in state and national politics, serving in Congress for one term. Her brother, Austin, who attended law school and became an attorney, lived next door with his wife, Susan Gilbert. Dickinson\u2019s younger sister, Lavinia, also lived at home for her entire life in similar isolation. Lavinia and Austin were not only family, but intellectual companions for Dickinson during her lifetime.Dickinson's poetry was heavily influenced by the Metaphysical poets of seventeenth-century England, as well as her reading of the Book of Revelation and her upbringing in a Puritan New England town, which encouraged a Calvinist, orthodox, and conservative approach to Christianity.She admired the poetry of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, as well as John Keats. Though she was dissuaded from reading the verse of her contemporary Walt Whitman by rumors of its disgracefulness, the two poets are now connected by the distinguished place they hold as the founders of a uniquely American poetic voice. While Dickinson was extremely prolific as a poet and regularly enclosed poems in letters to friends, she was not publicly recognized during her lifetime. The first volume of her work was published posthumously in 1890 and the last in 1955. She died in Amherst in 1886.Upon her death, Dickinson's family discovered forty handbound volumes of nearly 1,800 poems, or \"fascicles\" as they are sometimes called. Dickinson assembled these booklets by folding and sewing five or six sheets of stationery paper and copying what seem to be final versions of poems. The handwritten poems show a variety of dash-like marks of various sizes and directions (some are even vertical). The poems were initially unbound and published according to the aesthetics of her many early editors, who removed her unusual and varied dashes, replacing them with traditional punctuation. The current standard version of her poems replaces her dashes with an en-dash, which is a closer typographical approximation to her intention. The original order of the poems was not restored until 1981, when Ralph W. Franklin used the physical evidence of the paper itself to restore her intended order, relying on smudge marks, needle punctures, and other clues to reassemble the packets. Since then, many critics have argued that there is a thematic unity in these small collections, rather than their order being simply chronological or convenient. The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson (Belknap Press, 1981) is the only volume that keeps the order intact.Selected BibliographyPoetryThe Gorgeous Nothings: Emily Dickinson's Envelope Poems (New Direction, 2013)Final Harvest: Emily Dickinson's Poems (Little, Brown, 1962)The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson (Little, Brown, 1960)Bolts of Melody: New Poems of Emily Dickinson (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945)Unpublished Poems of Emily Dickinson (Little, Brown, 1935)Further Poems of Emily Dickinson: Withheld from Publication by Her Sister Lavinia (Little, Brown, 1929)The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson (Little, Brown, 1924)The Single Hound: Poems of a Lifetime (Little, Brown, 1914)Poems: Third Series (Roberts Brothers, 1896)Poems: Second Series (Roberts Brothers, 1892)Poems (Roberts Brothers, 1890)ProseEmily Dickinson Face to Face: Unpublished Letters with Notes and Reminiscences (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1932)Letters of Emily Dickinson (Roberts Brothers, 1894)"}</script>

He lived in St. Louis during the first eighteen years of his life and attended Harvard University. In 1910, he left the United States for the Sorbonne, having earned both undergraduate and masters degrees and having contributed several poems to the Harvard Advocate.After a year in Paris, he returned to Harvard to pursue a doctorate in philosophy, but returned to Europe and settled in England in 1914. The following year, he married Vivienne Haigh-Wood and began working in London, first as a teacher, and later for Lloyd's Bank.It was in London that Eliot came under the influence of his contemporary Ezra Pound, who recognized his poetic genius at once, and assisted in the publication of his work in a number of magazines, most notably \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in Poetry in 1915. His first book of poems, Prufrock and Other Observations, was published in 1917, and immediately established him as a leading poet of the avant-garde. With the publication of The Waste Land in 1922, now considered by many to be the single most influential poetic work of the twentieth century, Eliot's reputation began to grow to nearly mythic proportions; by 1930, and for the next thirty years, he was the most dominant figure in poetry and literary criticism in the English-speaking world.As a poet, he transmuted his affinity for the English metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century (most notably John Donne) and the nineteenth century French symbolist poets (including Baudelaire and Laforgue) into radical innovations in poetic technique and subject matter. His poems in many respects articulated the disillusionment of a younger post\u2013World War I generation with the values and conventions\u2014both literary and social\u2014of the Victorian era. As a critic also, he had an enormous impact on contemporary literary taste, propounding views that, after his conversion to orthodox Christianity in the late thirties, were increasingly based in social and religious conservatism. His major later poetry collections include Ash Wednesday (1930) and Four Quartets (1943); his books of literary and social criticism include The Sacred Wood (1920), The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1933), After Strange Gods (1934), and Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1940). Eliot was also an important playwright, whose verse dramas include Murder in the Cathedral, The Family Reunion, and The Cocktail Party.He became a British citizen in 1927; long associated with the publishing house of Faber &amp; Faber, he published many younger poets, and eventually became director of the firm. After a notoriously unhappy first marriage, Eliot separated from his first wife in 1933, and remarried Valerie Fletcher in 1956. T. S. Eliot received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948. He died in London on January 4, 1965.Selected BibliographyPoetryCollected Poems (1962)The Complete Poems and Plays (1952)Four Quartets (1943)Burnt Norton (1941)The Dry Salvages (1941)East Coker (1940)Ash Wednesday (1930)Poems, 1909\u20131925 (1925)The Waste Land (1922)Poems (1919)Prufrock and Other Observations (1917)ProseReligious Drama: Mediaeval and Modern (1954)The Three Voices of Poetry (1954)Poetry and Drama (1951)Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1949)The Classics and The Man of Letters (1942)The Idea of a Christian Society (1940)Essays Ancient and Modern (1936)Elizabethan Essays (1934)The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1933)After Strange Gods (1933)John Dryden (1932)Thoughts After Lambeth (1931)Tradition and Experimentation in Present-Day Literature (1929)Dante (1929)For Lancelot Andrews (1928)Andrew Marvell (1922)The Sacred Wood (1920)DramaThe Elder Statesman (1958)The Confidential Clerk (1953)The Cocktail Party (1950)The Family Reunion (1939)Murder in the Cathedral (1935)The Rock (1934)Sweeney Agonistes (1932)"}</script>

The family, which consisted of nine children, lived in Brooklyn and Long Island in the 1820s and 1830s.At the age of twelve, Whitman began to learn the printer's trade, and fell in love with the written word. Largely self-taught, he read voraciously, becoming acquainted with the works of Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible.Whitman worked as a printer in New York City until a devastating fire in the printing district demolished the industry. In 1836, at the age of seventeen, he began his career as teacher in the one-room school houses of Long Island. He continued to teach until 1841, when he turned to journalism as a full-time career.He founded a weekly newspaper, Long-Islander, and later edited a number of Brooklyn and New York papers. In 1848, Whitman left the Brooklyn Daily Eagle to become editor of the New Orleans Crescent. It was in New Orleans that he experienced firsthand the viciousness of slavery in the slave markets of that city. On his return to Brooklyn in the fall of 1848, he founded a \"free soil\" newspaper, the Brooklyn Freeman, and continued to develop the unique style of poetry that later so astonished Ralph Waldo Emerson.In 1855, Whitman took out a copyright on the first edition of Leaves of Grass, which consisted of twelve untitled poems and a preface. He published the volume himself, and sent a copy to Emerson in July of 1855. Whitman released a second edition of the book in 1856, containing thirty-three poems, a letter from Emerson praising the first edition, and a long open letter by Whitman in response. During his lifetime, Whitman continued to refine the volume, publishing several more editions of the book. Noted Whitman scholar, M. Jimmie Killingsworth writes that \"the 'merge,' as Whitman conceived it, is the tendency of the individual self to overcome moral, psychological, and political boundaries. Thematically and poetically, the notion dominates the three major poems of 1855: 'I Sing the Body Electric,' 'The Sleepers,' and 'Song of Myself,' all of which were 'merged' in the first edition under the single title Leaves of Grass but were demarcated by clear breaks in the text and the repetition of the title.\"At the outbreak of the Civil War, Whitman vowed to live a \"purged\" and \"cleansed\" life. He worked as a freelance journalist and visited the wounded at New York City\u2013area hospitals. He then traveled to Washington, D. C. in December 1862 to care for his brother who had been wounded in the war.Overcome by the suffering of the many wounded in Washington, Whitman decided to stay and work in the hospitals and stayed in the city for eleven years. He took a job as a clerk for the Department of the Interior, which ended when the Secretary of the Interior, James Harlan, discovered that Whitman was the author of Leaves of Grass, which Harlan found offensive. Harlan fired the poet.Whitman struggled to support himself through most of his life. In Washington, he lived on a clerk's salary and modest royalties, and spent any excess money, including gifts from friends, to buy supplies for the patients he nursed. He had also been sending money to his widowed mother and an invalid brother. From time to time writers both in the states and in England sent him \"purses\" of money so that he could get by.In the early 1870s, Whitman settled in Camden, New Jersey, where he had come to visit his dying mother at his brother's house. However, after suffering a stroke, Whitman found it impossible to return to Washington. He stayed with his brother until the 1882 publication of Leaves of Grass (James R. Osgood) gave Whitman enough money to buy a home in Camden.In the simple two-story clapboard house, Whitman spent his declining years working on additions and revisions to a new edition of the book and preparing his final volume of poems and prose, Good-Bye, My Fancy (David McKay, 1891). After his death on March 26, 1892, Whitman was buried in a tomb he designed and had built on a lot in Harleigh Cemetery.Along with Emily Dickinson, he is considered one of America's most important poets.Selected BibliographyPoetryLeaves of Grass (David McKay, 1891)Good-Bye, My Fancy (David McKay, 1891)Leaves of Grass (James R.

S. Eliot was discovered by Ezra Pound, who became his lifelong editor and friend. Pound arranged for the publication of Eliot's early work, and significantly edited The Waste Land. Though born in America, Eliot spent most of his life in England where he was an editor for Faber &amp; Faber, and created and edited the journal Criterion, which became enormously influential during the years in which he was the editor.His memorial in Poet\u2019s Corner at Westminster Abbey reads, \"The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living,\" from \"Little Gidding,\" one of the Four Quartets. Begun over a decade after The Waste Land garnered critical praise and attention for Eliot, the quartets were first published separately between 1935 and 1942, and later collected into a single volume. In 1948, after the publication of Four Quartets, Eliot won the Nobel Prize in Literature.Eliot considered these four long poems to be his finest achievement and the pinnacle of his career. More overtly philosophical and Christian than The Waste Land, the quartets contain a mixture of imagistic, poetic language and the philosophical thought.Though each of the quartets is considered to be a masterpiece, \"Burnt Norton\" and \"Little Gidding\" have been the most praised and analyzed. Of \"Burnt Norton,\" literary critic Hugh Kenner said: \"Suggestion does not outrun thought, nor design impose itself on what word and cadence are capable of suggesting. It was a precarious unobtrusive masterpiece, which had for some years no successor.\""}</script>

Given how different they were (one a sonnet sequence about his autism-spectrum son, another a slave narrative) that\u2019s saying a lot.

He worked as a printer in New York City until a devastating fire in the printing district demolished the industry. In 1836, at the age of seventeen, he began his career as teacher in the one-room schoolhouses of Long Island. He continued to teach until 1841, when he turned to journalism as a full-time career. He founded a weekly newspaper, and later edited several Brooklyn and New York papers. In 1848, he became the editor of the New Orleans Crescent, but soon returned to Brooklyn where he founded the newspaper, Brooklyn Freeman, in response to the viciousness of the slave markets he witnessed in New Orleans.In 1855, Whitman published his first edition of Leaves of Grass, a slim volume consisting of twelve untitled poems and a preface. He designed the cover, and typeset and paid for the printing of the book himself. Upon the completion, he sent a copy to Ralph Waldo Emerson, who praised it so highly that Whitman reprinted the letter, in subsequent editions\u2014without obtaining Emerson\u2019s permission. The letter from Emerson included the now famous line: \"I greet you at the beginning of a great career.\"A year later, in 1856, Whitman released a second edition of the book with a total of thirty-three poems. Over the course of his life, Whitman continued to rework and enlarge the volume, publishing several more editions of the book. The version left in 1892, at the time of his death, contained 383 poems, including \"When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom\u2019d\" and \"O Captain! My Captain!\" both written to memorialize President Lincoln.Well-known poems in the 1855 edition include \"I Sing the Body Electric,\" \"The Sleepers,\" and \"Song of Myself, \" a long poem in fifty-two sections, which is considered by many to be his masterpiece. It contains lines such as \"I am large, I contain multitudes\" and \"I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, / If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\"The critical and popular response to Leaves of Grass was overwhelmingly positive. One critic noted, in an 1855 review in Life Illustrated, \"It is like no other book that ever was written, and therefore, the language usually employed in notices of new publications is unavailable in describing it.\" Unusually prescient, even now, Leaves of Grass has become an unavoidable influence on American poetry.Though considered to be a transcendentalist alongside Henry David Thoreau and Emerson, Whitman's greatest legacy is his invention of a truly American free verse. His groundbreaking, open, inclusive, and optimistic poems are written in long, sprawling lines and span an astonishing variety of subject matter and points of view\u2014embodying the democratic spirit of his new America."}</script>

She wrote thousands of letters to family and friends in which she shared her poetry and her active mental and emotional life, but was otherwise a recluse. Many scholars have speculated about the love-object in Dickinson\u2019s poems, as well as the intended recipient of the enigmatic letters written to \u201cMaster.\u201d Some possibilities include Judge Otis Lorde, Samuel Bowles, and her sister-in-law and close friend Susan Gilbert.Only eight of her poems were published during her lifetime, primarily submitted by family and friends without her permission. In 1890, four years after her death, the first published selection of her poems appeared; however, it was significantly altered and edited by editors seeking to \"normalize\" her language, punctuation, and rhythms. Publication of other volumes of poetry continued until her complete poems were published in three volumes in 1955, collected and chronologically arranged by Thomas H. Johnson. In 1960, her complete work appeared for the first time in one complete edition, with all 1,775 poems restored to the original, unaltered versions that Dickinson had intended.Frequently anthologized poems include, \"Because I could not stop for Death, \" \"I\u2019m Nobody! Who are you? \" and \"I heard a Fly buzz. \" Of the many poems Dickinson wrote about grief and loneliness, \"There\u2019s a certain Slant of light\" and \"I Measure Every Grief I Meet\" are excellent examples.Her poetry reflects her loneliness and the speakers of her poems generally live in a state of want; but her poems are also marked by the intimate recollection of inspirational moments that are decidedly life-giving and suggest the possibility of future happiness. Her spare, abstract meditations were heavily influenced by the Metaphysical poets of seventeenth-century, as well as by her Puritan upbringing. Equally as influential as Walt Whitman, Dickinson\u2019s verse inspired the branch of American poetics that emphasizes line breaks, abstraction, and precision."}</script>

Smith, our current U.S. poet laureate, entering into a new phase of attention. Where the poet\u2019s previous books turned to global cultures or looked to the galaxies\u2014with all of their transnational and metaphorical heft\u2014to explore themes of loss, desire, and identity, in this collection Smith owns her displeasure with the world and captures the social and political unrest of the age. The poems protest the emotional mistreatment of women, the corporate dumping of toxic waste into natural waters, and the curious phenomenon of mansplaining: \u201cHe\u2019ll grin watching you squint, deciphering / Rivers, borders, bridges arcing up from rock. He\u2019ll recite / Its history. How one empire swallowed another. How one / Civilization lasted 3,000 years with no word for eternity.\u201d Here, too, Smith makes the implicit argument that acts of political resistance and acts of social kindness, like coming to the aid of a neighbor, are also acts of holistic charity and love (\u201cIs it strange to say love is a language / Few practice, but all, or near all speak?\u201d). The poems in Wade in the Water are\u2014in classic Smith fashion\u2014gorgeously nuanced in music and in feeling and occasionally offbeat in their logic, as when the speaker is visited by two angels in \u201cleather biker gear\u201d or when God comes down from the hills in his jeep. Amid a book that includes, in documentary fashion, abridged letters by African American slaves during the Civil War as well as poems about the caprices of motherhood, Smith lands on the power of art and its ability to pierce us \u201csuddenly / By pillars of heavy light\u201d in poems such as \u201cWade in the Water,\u201d \u201cTheatrical Improvisation,\u201d and \u201cRealm of Shades\u201d to return us to feelings of love, \u201cuncannily, as though all of us must be / / Buried deep within each other.\u201dThis review originally appeared in\u00a0American Poets, Spring-Summer 2018."}</script>

A steady mist&#13;to recall departures, a bitter downpour &#13;for betrayal. As if the first thing&#13;a man wants to do when he learns his wife&#13;is sleeping with his best friend, and has been&#13;for years, the very first thing&#13;is not to make a drink, and drink it,&#13;and make another, but to walk outside&#13;into bad weather. It's true&#13;that the way we look doesn't always&#13;reveal our feelings. Which is a problem&#13;for the movies. And why somebody has to smash&#13;a mirror, for example, to show he's angry&#13;and full of self-hate, whereas actual people &#13;rarely do this. And rarely sit on benches&#13;in the pouring rain to weep. Is he wondering&#13;why he didn't see it long ago? Is he wondering&#13;if in fact he did, and lied to himself?&#13;And perhaps she also saw the many ways &#13;he'd allowed himself to be deceived. In this city &#13;it will rain all night. So the three of them&#13;return to their houses, and the wife&#13;and her lover go upstairs to bed&#13;while the husband takes a small black pistol&#13;from a drawer, turns it over in his hands,&#13;then puts it back. Thus demonstrating&#13;his inability to respond to passion&#13;with passion. But we don't want him&#13;to shoot his wife, or his friend, or himself.&#13;And we've begun to suspect&#13;that none of this is going to work out,&#13;that we'll leave the theater feeling&#13;vaguely cheated, just as the movie,&#13;turning away from the husband's sorrow,&#13;leaves him to be a man who must continue,&#13;day after day, to walk outside into the rain,&#13;outside and back again, since now there can be&#13;nowhere in this world for him to rest.&#13;"}</script>

I suppose this is a poem in which I admit that I do; it turns out that what I worry over the most is being misunderstood. I'm also considering proximity, between our physical bodies and the symbols others decide they are, between history and our inheritance of it; I'm trying to complicate and expand how we are seen versus how we see ourselves. I like the idea of a speaker who picks her own symbols, in this case, a meteor: a body from outer space that becomes more and more incandescent, until her arrival into the earth's atmosphere is announced by a streak of light.”<br /><em>—Tarfia Faizullah</em></p></div></div></div> </div>

will misunderstand my silence

as a lack of love, or interest, instead
of a tent city built for my own mind,  

I worry I can no longer pretend 
enough to get through another

year of pretending I know 
that I understand time, though 

I can see my own hands; sometimes, 
I worry over how to dress in a world 

where a white woman wearing 
a scarf over her head is assumed 

to be cold, whereas with my head 
cloaked, I am an immediate symbol 

of a war folks have been fighting 
eons-deep before I was born, a meteor.

is like rolling bales of hay in Texas.
Nothing but the horizon to stop you.

But consider the railroad's edge of metal trash;
bird perches, miles of telephone wires.
What is so innocent as grazing cattle?
If you think about it, it turns into words.

Trash is so cheerful; flying up
like grasshoppers in front of the reaper.
The dust devil whirls it aloft; bronze candy wrappers,
squares of clear plastic—windows on a house of air.

Below the weedy edge in last year's mat,
red and silver beer cans.
In bits blown equally everywhere,
the gaiety of flying paper
and the black high flung patterns of flocking birds.</pre>

Nothing to have at heart. 
It is to have or nothing. 

It is a thing to have, 
A lion, an ox in his breast, 
To feel it breathing there.
 
Corazon, stout dog, 
Young ox, bow-legged bear, 
He tastes its blood, not spit. 

He is like a man 
In the body of a violent beast. 
Its muscles are his own . . .

The lion sleeps in the sun. 
Its nose is on its paws. 
It can kill a man. </pre>
