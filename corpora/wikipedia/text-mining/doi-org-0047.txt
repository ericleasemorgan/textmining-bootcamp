                            Linking microarray data to the literature

                            	Daniel R. Masys1









                    
    



                    
                        The availability in computerized form of the published literature on genes is a potentially rich source of information for the interpretation of microarray data. Automated text processing confronts substantial challenges due to variability in the language used by authors, but even incomplete linking of gene clusters to the literature can reveal functional information that is useful in explaining gene expression patterns.
