                <p>Digital Humanities (DH) methods incorporated into traditional (non-DH) humanities
                    classrooms present a fruitful opportunity to help undergraduate students learn
                    digital literacy skills as well as new ways of studying the humanities. In light
                    of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and
                    choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially
                    face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence
                    with it through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH
                    as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community when they
                    themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist, from reluctance to
                    change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore, this article offers a
                    selection of accessible DH methods that can be used to positively shape
                    humanities pedagogy.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">As a graduate student in English Literature, I was one of the lucky ones: my first
                teaching assistant experience came in a new English course that included a component
                related to Digital Humanities (DH)–a public blog–as part of its assessment. I had
                never encountered DH in my humanities degree programs at previous universities, but
                I soon found myself investigating other ways of integrating DH into traditional
                undergraduate courses to better prepare students with digital literacy skills for
                the 21st-century information society and show them new ways of studying their
                favorite subjects. My research has led me to the conclusion that incorporating DH
                methods into non-DH classrooms is more than pedagogically important–it is an ethical
                duty and a feminist imperative. Humanities students need digital literacy
                skills–including the women who make up the majority of such students and potentially
                face gender biases related to digital technology and computing culture–and DH tools
                and methods are well-oriented toward the development of these skills within the
                context of the humanities. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">First, a definition of terms is needed to clarify what is meant by Digital
                Humanities, digital pedagogy, and digital literacy. Digital Humanities involves the
                production and use of digital technologies for new types of teaching and research in
                the humanities (English, history, philosophy, and related fields) and/or computer
                science and a critical perspective on such technologies [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#terras2011">Terras 2011</a>].
                Digital pedagogy is the use of digital technology in teaching and learning along
                with a critical reflection on how it can improve these activities [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#digitalpedagogy2013">Digital Pedgagogy? 2013</a>]. Definitions of digital literacy range from
                having a general proficiency with digital technology to being able to “identify, access, manage, integrate, evaluate, analyze and
                        synthesize digital resources, construct new knowledge, create media
                        expressions, and communicate with others”
                     [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#martin2008">Martin 2008</a>]. In “Reconceptualising critical digital literacy”
                Luciana Pangrazio acknowledges that the fast-changing nature of digital practices
                means that students need to develop a critical disposition transferable across
                digital contexts rather than just learn how to use a new piece of technology. This
                definition of critical digital literacy thus encompasses both technical skills and “an understanding of the role humans play in questioning,
                        challenging and therefore shaping this techno-social system”
                     [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#pangrazio2016">Pangrazio 2016</a>, 169]. There is a clear overlap between Digital Humanities, digital pedagogy, and
                digital literacy, especially regarding the importance of critically analyzing
                technology while engaging with it. This article takes a broad, inclusive view of
                what constitutes DH tools and methods and aims to be accessible to those without
                programming knowledge. Ultimately, it is for teachers to decide which aspects of
                Digital Humanities will allow them to best engage in digital pedagogy and foster
                critical digital literacy skills in their students. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">My initial review of the field of DH found relatively few materials on pedagogy, or
                how a teacher new to these ideas might be able to benefit from all of the
                interesting and exciting knowledge emerging from the DH community. Articles on
                pedagogy in Digital Humanities-specific books and journals–including <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The
                    Journal of Digital Humanities</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities
                    Pedagogy</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital
                    Humanities</cite>–tend to focus on classes already identified as belonging to
                the field of Digital Humanities or ones housed within departments working on DH
                research projects. Some assume a level of familiarity with DH concepts that may
                discourage newcomers from engaging with the digital technology presented. However,
                when I followed the articles’ references to blog posts on scholars’ websites and on
                networks like HASTAC<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e228">[1]</a>, I found resources on teaching that seem
                better suited to those new to DH. I extended my search to the relatively new online
                journals <cite class="title italic">Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The
                    Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</cite>, which seek to help
                teachers navigate the shifting landscape of digital media, and other scholarly
                resources on technology in the field of education. These present numerous calls for
                digital pedagogy and literacy<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e240">[2]</a> to prepare students for
                the 21st century, but their broader scope may mean they are missed by those
                searching for humanities-specific resources. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Although many DH research projects focus on literary studies or are housed in English
                    departments<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e251">[3]</a>, I found that there
                remains a lack of resources surrounding how DH might transform the traditional
                undergraduate classroom in my own field of English. One of the most accessible
                resources I encountered was a special issue of <cite class="title italic">The CEA Critic
                </cite>on Digital Humanities pedagogy by the College English Association in the
                U.S. in 2014. One of its editors acknowledges that “very few texts address how
                    teachers can apply DH in <em class="emph">literature</em> classrooms” and “[f]or most English faculty, DH as a field remains uncharted
                        territory”
                     [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#iantorno2014">Iantorno 2014</a>, 140–141]. The issue includes an overview of DH undergraduate pedagogy and five case
                studies from English teachers who have incorporated varying degrees of DH into their
                classrooms. The issue’s strengths are that it targets English teachers, focuses on
                undergraduate pedagogy, and presents DH as a helpful and enjoyable accompaniment to
                traditional teaching techniques. In a similar vein, the <cite class="title italic">Digital
                    Pedagogy in the Humanities</cite> collection curated by the Modern Language
                Association (MLA) seeks to appeal to both experienced and novice humanities teachers
                and addresses the need for more scholarly examples of digital pedagogy.<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e277">[4]</a> Instead of offering more text-based essays, it provides an
                open-access, born-digital collection of pedagogical resources sorted by keywords
                like “hybrid” and “rhetoric”. Although
                keywords are not specific to nor organized by traditional disciplines by design, the
                fact that they are in an MLA publication signals their importance and relevance to
                the field of English.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Yet despite relatively easy access to the resources listed, traditional humanities
                students and teachers may be unaware of them<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e291">[5]</a> if they are not
                specifically searching for content with the keyword ‘digital’, and they may still be
                hesitant about a departure from familiar research and teaching practices, especially
                if it seems like they need to become masters of digital technology and learn how to
                use seemingly complicated software programs. This foreshadows a continuing lack of
                changes in pedagogy if humanities teachers do not use digital pedagogy and include
                digital literacy as a core competency and thus begin to shape future teachers.
                Therefore, this article seeks to present several compelling reasons for why DH
                methods belong in the classroom and then collate a variety of accessible ways to
                incorporate them.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Why DH methods belong in the classroom</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">DH methods belong in the classroom because they offer a fruitful means of
                    developing the digital literacy skills that students need to prepare them for
                    their personal and professional lives. Teachers should not leave them to

                    Students themselves express a desire to learn more about and engage with
                    technology. EDUCAUSE’s study of 3,000 U.S. undergraduates indicates that
                    students frequently use applications in which their skill levels do not meet
                    their needs, especially in the areas of programming languages and e-portfolios

                    about three out of four students agree that technology helps them achieve
                    academic outcomes and prepares them for the workplace [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#dahlstrom2013">Dahlstrom, Walker, and Dziuban 2013</a>]. The most popular combination of how to deliver
                    more technology training is through face-to-face instruction in traditionally
                    designed courses, which leads authors to conclude that “students aren’t really
                        interested in taking separate ‘digital literacy’ courses
                        or even using on-demand web or help desk resources,” preferring to follow
                    their teachers’ guidance regarding technology [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#dahlstrom2013">Dahlstrom, Walker, and Dziuban 2013</a>, 11]. It makes sense, then, for humanities teachers to be the ones to
                    facilitate students’ engagement with technology within the context of their
                    courses. As Cunningham et al. argue, “Information literacy and a sophisticated level of
                            computer literacy can no longer be considered appendages to an Arts
                            degree. They must be incorporated into the course work for the degree
                            itself”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#cunningham2008">Cunningham et al. 2008</a>]. Neglecting to teach digital literacy in humanities courses prevents
                    students from gaining the technological skills that they hope for or expect from
                    their undergraduate education. </div>

                    rather than focus on specific vocational training, but there is a risk of
                    underpreparing students if teachers assume that they inherently know how to
                    transfer the oft-repeated skills of critical thinking and writing to the digital
                    realm. Students are not “digital natives” just by virtue of
                    living and breathing apps and social media in a world of data. Many lack basic
                    digital literacy skills, from understanding the logic of code and tagging behind
                    webpages [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#ficke2014">Ficke 2014</a>, 207] to knowing about file naming
                    conventions and advanced web searches [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#mostern2013">Mostern and Gainor 2013</a>]. Critical
                    evaluation of sources becomes increasingly complex online, where websites blend
                    human- and bot-created content, sponsored listings, and nonlinear text and
                    hyperlinks without traditional marks of credibility or authority [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#mcverry2013">McVerry 2013</a>, 13]. Students must be able to decipher the
                    perspectives and motives of a webpage’s authors in order to judge its usefulness
                    and truthfulness [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#mcverry2013">McVerry 2013</a>, 91, 95]. They need guidance
                    to transfer the skills developed through the close reading of a poem or
                    manuscript to an analysis of a modern multimedia website. In a time of
                    significant social, political, and ecological challenges, humanities teachers
                    with “intimate and largely unsupervised access to developing minds” have a
                    tremendous opportunity to positively influence the next generation [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#menand2010">Menand 2010</a>, 129]. The definitions of critical thinking and
                    writing are flexible enough to address the need for critical digital literacy,
                    which will allow students to transfer traditional skills to the changing digital
                    world.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kennedy-long.html#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Indeed, students rely on transferable skills like critical thinking developed in
                    humanities degrees for their future success, be that in the workplace, graduate
                    school, or elsewhere. They therefore need not only critical thinking and writing
                    skills for print-based and digital environments, but also competence with
                    digital technology. As the Learning Literacies for the Digital Age (LLiDA)
                    project found, the “nature of work is changing, not just for the growing
                        numbers of graduates directly employed in the ‘digital’
                        industries”, with over three-quarters of jobs in the UK, for example,
                    needing information technology competence and a continual updating of skills

                    connected to the humanities is the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and
                    Museums) sector, which needs staff to be digitally literate to properly digitize
                    content, manage databases, and deliver technology-based educational programs.
                    But historically, humanities teachers have been resistant to the notion of
                    practicality in their courses; they espouse learning for learning’s sake and
                    assign essays that seem to be training more researchers like themselves rather
                    than enabling students to have an impact on their world.<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e369">[6]</a> Yet the reality is that most undergraduate students will not
                    go into academia; indeed, there are not enough jobs for those who have trained
                    for them [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#menand2010">Menand 2010</a>]. Humanities students may not have chosen a
                    vocational path, but many still view an undergraduate degree as a means of
                    obtaining a good job to support themselves. They want “education with labour market value that provides them
                            with skills relevant for today and tomorrow”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#hoidn2014">Hoidn and Kärkkäinen 2014</a>, 13]. Teachers who extend the learning experience to include digital literacy
                    prepare students with an expanded set of skills for whichever path they choose
                    to pursue.</div>

                    that the person will be a woman. In much of the world, women are pursuing higher

                    DH methods into their courses, they offer women in those courses the chance to
                    experiment with technology as a different way of studying the subject. They also

                    Concerns continue to be raised by DH scholars, including Tara McPherson with
                        “Why are the Digital Humanities So White?”
                    [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#mcpherson2012">McPherson 2012</a>]; Adeline Koh and Roopika Risam with their

                    of the #transformDH movement. Brett D. Hirsch’s introduction to <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Pedagogy</cite> acknowledges that DH
                    pedagogy could be discussing issues of “class, disability, ethnicity, gender,
                        race, and sexuality” and limited diversity in the DH community but falls
                    short of this potential [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#hirsch2012">Hirsch 2012</a>, 27]. Though the number
                    of DH centers and degree programs is increasing, they are still housed in a
                    minority of institutions which tend to be located in North America or Europe.
                    Many students will not have the option of choosing a DH minor, major, or
                    certificate or going to the University of Victoria’s popular Digital Humanities
                    Summer Institute, though they may be able to attend a local
                        THATCamp.<a class="noteRef" href="kennedy-long.html#d6127e475">[9]</a> Obstacles like funding,
                    institution size, infrastructure, language barriers, and geographical proximity
                    limit what institutions can offer in support of DH projects and travel to DH
                    events. Faculty already marginalized because of their contingent status
                    (discussed below) may be especially hesitant about DH-driven learning
                    experiences in the classroom, just as students already burdened by debt and
                    anxious about the job market may be hesitant about deviations from their
                    expectations. But if teachers include DH as a regular component of their
                    courses, this may serve to increase the diversity of the incoming generation of
                    DH scholars and drive change toward making DH more accessible and expected. Once
                    exposed to DH, some students will inevitably want to take the next step by
                    creating or joining a DH project, or pressuring their institution to begin
                    offering DH programs. Those students who eventually become teachers themselves
                    will also be used to the combination of traditional and DH teaching techniques
                    in their classroom, thus continuing to shape DH pedagogy. Certainly teaching
                    inflected with DH is not a panacea for all the world’s ills. But expanding the
                    pool of undergraduates familiar with DH represents one way to bring a more
                    diverse set of perspectives and bodies to the field.</div>

                    or perceived ability to experiment with DH. Indeed, in one survey of part-time
                    faculty members, respondents “paint a dismal picture” regarding

                    space, let alone access to servers and labs or an effectual relationship with IT
                    staff. Kenneth T. Ryesky lists nine barriers to adjunct faculty obtaining full
                    access to IT resources and support, ranging from compatibility issues between
                    campus technology and a teacher’s personal technology to the specialized
                    technology needs of some courses [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#ryesky2007">Ryesky 2007</a>]. Another obstacle
                    is that the structures of hiring and promotion often do not reward risk-taking
                        [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#rogers2015">Rogers 2015</a>]. Therefore, starting small with DH pedagogy, as
                    Ryan Cordell recommends [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#cordell2015">Cordell 2015</a>], may be the only way in the
                    foreseeable future of incorporating DH into undergraduate humanities classrooms.
                    This perspective follows the approach that Adeline Koh takes in “Introducing Digital Humanities Work to Undergraduates,”
                    where she offers easy ways for newcomers to implement DH projects in the

                    literacy skills as well as exposure to the field, teachers need to focus on
                    which aspects of technology they want to focus on in their course–overwhelming
                    students with too much technological interaction can be detrimental to their
                    confidence and future success. For those who lack access or experience with
                    computers due to various barriers, appropriate scaffolding is important to make
                    DH accessible in terms of both resources and level of difficulty. Erika E.
                    Smith’s review of the “digital native” debate finds several
                    studies that show the importance of socioeconomic status, including race and
                    gender, in affecting a student’s technology skills and abilities [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#smith2012">Smith 2012</a>]. By being aware of differing levels of technological
                    understanding, humanities teachers can avoid leaving inexperienced students
                    behind, as has happened in computer science when instructors incorrectly assume
                    a certain level of prior computing knowledge [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#cohoon2006">Cohoon and Aspray 2006</a>]. Using

                    design [<a class="ref" href="kennedy-long.html#biggs2007">Biggs and Tang 2007</a>], teachers can include a particular aspect of
                    digital literacy as one of the desired learning outcomes in a course and
                    gradually adapt the learning environment and assessments to be conducive to
                    students gaining new skills and comfort with technology in the context of the
                    humanities. In this way, teachers can “reverse engineer individual course
                        outcomes from what [they] want the successful graduating students to be able
                        to do” so that teaching becomes “the creating of a context for student

                    capture the spirit of DH with the hope that current and soon-to-be teachers will

                    minimal restrictions and guidance. In their 18th-century poetry course, Bill
                    Hutchings and Karen O’Rourke experimented with discontinuing the usual list of
                    neatly packaged essay questions and secondary sources–offered with the best of

                    So-called augmented editions can contain extra material “under the

                    of literary production in the 1800s as collaborative. Constructing a critical

                    scholarship in the digital environment. In so doing, they have the opportunity
                    to develop digital literacy skills around constructing knowledge online,
                    communicating via digital platforms, and critiquing crowd-sourced information. </div>

                            30 minutes grading it, and then the student throws it away”

                    incorporating more public writing into their courses they impart a crucial

                    classrooms helps teachers prepare students to be more critically informed and
                    engaged in the digital environment of the 21st-century information society, it
                    becomes the ethical choice. It also becomes a feminist imperative in light of
                    the increasing percentage of women in higher education and humanities programs
                    who would benefit from gaining more confidence with technology. The benefit of
                    DH is that allows teachers to promote digital literacy skills in a
                    humanities-specific context and take advantage of online tools and projects.
                    Because teachers new to DH may feel overwhelmed by the prospect of integrating
                    it into their classrooms–especially if they are contingent faculty or lack
                    access to DH centers and labs–this article presents methods from <cite class="title italic">Digital_Humanities</cite> as an accessible starting point for
                    transforming pedagogy. Teachers can foster more digital literacy among
