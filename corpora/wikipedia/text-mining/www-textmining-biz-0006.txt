Presentation







Text-mining refers to the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities).



textmining.biz enumerates some research scientists in Montpellier (TETIS and LIRMM labs) working in text mining domain. A joint group with both laboratories will be proposed soon (see "ADVanced Analytics for data SciencE (Advanse)", contact:  Pascal Poncelet and Sandra Bringay).
