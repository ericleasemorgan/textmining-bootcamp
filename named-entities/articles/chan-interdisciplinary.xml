<ORGANIZATION>Monash University Abstract Interdisciplinary</ORGANIZATION> collaboration brings the benefit of multiple perspectives to a research project yet it also provides opportunities for reflection on each discipline s knowledge base This article presents a case study in interdisciplinary collaboration between two disparate fields web development and anthropology We explore the challenges of translating between domains with differing values aims and methodologies as well as issues that arose for us during the development of a web application designed to provide a digital output of an ethnographic project We consider our experience using the Agile style of software development which emphasises rapid prototyping iteration and even failure In the long run we find negative experiences in web development can be more valuable than the positive ones The concept of knowledge brokerage is a useful term to describe the collaboration between the academics who were forced to conceptualise their data in new ways and the developer who negotiated these transitions between abstract information and binary data and between academia and a public facing web application Introduction 1 <ORGANIZATION>Interdisciplinarity</ORGANIZATION> is a key concept driving many calls for collaborative research and innovative teaching in the humanities The benefits of interdisciplinarity in education and research include an integration of knowledge freedom of inquiry and innovation <PERSON>Boix Mansilla</PERSON> and Dawes Duraisingh 2007 217 which is considered crucial to solving contemporary social problems and enhancing understanding of the arts and literature That said it is often difficult to embark on given that disciplinary silos and discourse communities stand as barriers to interdisciplinary research and education which in turn keep researchers from benefitting from each other s knowledge <PERSON>Borrego</PERSON> and Newswander 2010 62 This article recounts the story of an interdisciplinary research project which united the fields of web development and cultural anthropology that highlights failure as an important part of the research process As an example we reflected on the frequent crashing of the website by the anthropologists as they tried to input new material in a custom content management system The anthropologists often entered data in ways that yielded the message 502 Bad Gateway an error which appears whenever two servers running simultaneously aren t communicating In the early days of the project we came to see this phrase as a metaphor for the process of working collaboratively with our web project traversing many gateways between multiple viewpoints priorities and interests holding fast in some instances and breaking down in others 1 Despite its negative connotations we employ this phrase constructively to explain the negotiated stop and start process that characterised the working relationship between stakeholders <PERSON>Forte</PERSON> who has examined the social and cultural constructedness of websites has written about the process of organising ethnographic data and recorded sounds as the product of intense social organization brokerage and exchange revealing quite a different story from that may appear on the seemingly placid surface of a site Websites do not just tell stories they contain stories within them about themselves Forte 2005 94 2 This idea that a seemingly placid website conceals a dynamic and complex creative process that lies beneath also speaks to a more specific definition of what a digital repository is it is not just a storage site it is also a place to think through to imagine what is not present and to interpret what is Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> aims to be such a website communicating these meanings by sharing sounds field recorded in the sonically intense environments of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> through a browser based web application 2 The site was created by an interdisciplinary team comprised of researchers in anthropology working with a graduate student intern in the <ORGANIZATION>University of Melbourne s Masters of Information Technology</ORGANIZATION> program 3 who served multiple roles of product manager designer and web developer and is hereafter referred to as the web developer even when discussing product and design concerns 3 From an academic perspective this project required a web presence because the researchers wanted a digital format for a broader audience and to provide a more immersive and holistic view of sonic practice through multimedia including audio text and images This requirement echoes a call from researchers in the digital humanities who wish to challenge the primacy of text to produce an expanded concept of the sensorium of humanistic knowledge <PERSON>Burdick</PERSON> et al 2012 121 Scholars such as <PERSON>Bellamy Bellamy</PERSON> 2012 and <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wiercinski Murray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wiercinski</PERSON> 2014 have described digital humanities projects in terms of the ways in which software practitioners build tools for humanities scholars in the earlier input phases of the research cycle Yet Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> can be understood as a digital research output which demonstrates the intersection of utility in terms of its educative dissemination of research findings and art as a creative and expressive product 4 This article explores what was learned about web development anthropology and interdisciplinary collaboration as the web developer and anthropologists came to work together Web developers and academics both work within standard constraints such as time budget and role management The anthropologists however had to reconceptualise the way they viewed their data to produce Sonic Japan For instance rather than merely writing up their impressions of the field and adding analytic comments they had to ask themselves new questions regarding information and ethical considerations such as What metadata needs to be attached to the sound files to be meaningfully understood in a digital domain How do ethical requirements regarding privacy and anonymity in human research interface with the precision of digital representation in terms of mapping and description 5 For the developer on the other hand the challenges around the translation and interpretation of data in the digital realm were not unique because software engineers routinely work with non specialists Rather her challenge was to effectively act as a knowledge broker between the academics their data the software and a public audience <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> defines knowledge brokers as those who facilitate the creation sharing and use of knowledge they also establish and maintain links between researchers and their audience and link know how know why and know who in the public domain as much as in the private domain <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> 2010 119 This definition was an apt one for the web developer who was focussed on taking the anthropologists data to a lay audience via the website a distinct task outside the anthropologists comfort zone of writing for academic audiences 6 As in often the case in independent study projects the web developer took on the project with vague goals no clear workflow and no budget to be completed within the 12 week internship period Despite this she used an iterative development style called Agile to overcome some of these obstacles and was able to launch a prototype site within the timeframe Presenting initial user interface prototypes to the anthropologists helped expose further goals and design questions Bugs emerging during the implementation of a content management system for Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> s sounds also invited a re examination of code and engineering methodology Later on deployment on the web led the developer to re evaluate product development methodology design decisions and project priorities While the anthropologists had no experience with the startup mantra of fail fast fail often and were generally frightened at the thought of visible failure they soon found that the refrain certainly applied in the anthropology domain and had undeniable benefits 7 In the first part of this article we outline the gaps emerging when the two fields of web development and anthropology collaborated on this project Then we discuss the application of web development methodologies for Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> focusing on design questions and the critical intersection between the interdisciplinary teams various definitions of success through prototyping and iteration Lastly we reflect on the hindrances and opportunities that emerged from our interdisciplinary partnership using the metaphor of a bad gateway for the learning experience Anthropology versus Web Development 8 Anthropology sits somewhere between the social sciences and the humanities and since the 1980s has been known for its reflexive and critical gaze <PERSON>Ingold</PERSON> notes that p erhaps uniquely among academic disciplines anthropology thrives on the art of its own perpetual deconstruction Caught at the intersection of two cross cutting tensions between the humanities and the natural sciences on the one hand and between theoretical speculation and lived experience on the other it leaves little room for intellectual complacency Ingold 1994 xii 9 On the other hand web development is more concerned with synthesis than analysis particularly the synthesis of tools and systems to solve problems Developing Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> prompted both anthropologist and developer team members to rethink their definition of data In object oriented programming data is typically a series of fields or attributes which together form an object analogous to a real world concept For example an employee in X Department with salary Y position Z and employee number 12345 this collection of attributes creates an instance of an Employee Of course the employee s humanity is more complex than that but a computer thinks only in ones and zeroes and data must be parceled into discrete units for the machine to process Thus in computer science data is a specific type of approximation of empirical reality An object is an abstraction to the developer Software engineering feeds on discovering abstractions which form the basis of flexible maintainable systems 10 In winnowing down a complex world to one of binaries or of fields and objects the representation of nuanced ideas can be limited Compared to software engineers anthropologists see their data as constantly constructed contextualised and contested in time in space and by the individuals involved as demonstrated through differences in language sociocultural position and value Categories are not so objectively defined and often have blurred boundaries <PERSON>Schreibman Sievers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Unsworth</PERSON> note that collaboration in the digital humanities brings to light these differences especially in the case of what they call knowledge bearing artifacts The process of such representation especially so when done with the attention to detail and the consistency demanded by the computing environment requires humanists to make explicit what they know about their material and to understand the ways in which that material exceeds or escapes representation <PERSON>Schreibman</PERSON> et al 2004 11 In this case the web design and development process pushed the anthropologists to re evaluate their data not only in terms of its content and communicative impact but also what they themselves understood about their relationship to the data and how that relationship shaped its presentation and meaning For example one of the initial design proposals was to situate each sound as a marker on an interactive map using the Google Maps API Some sounds recorded in place could be attributed to a single latitude and longitude point but what of a sound recorded in motion What of sounds recorded at the same site but at different times The anthropologists as experts in ethnographic writing had less experience in thinking about how best to organise and present the complexity of their material in ways other than text However the web developer faced the challenge of translating and ordering anthropological data into a version appropriate for a computer to manipulate without sacrificing too much of the data s cultural significance and analytic potential Specifically the anthropological data had to be modeled into objects with fields and data types to introduce enough abstraction to create a flexible system Because the researchers had been there when the data was recorded they often had very specific ideas about how it should be presented and these requirements were not always logical to a developer aiming to design a web system based on repeat functionality through abstraction Differing Aims and Methodologies 12 Software engineering aims to solve problems with software systems All methodologies that follow primarily stem from The User Though business models and technical constraints are also considered during development software that purely emphasizes the software engineer instead of the user would result in a product with limited potential Thus the software development life cycle aims to satisfy users within constraints This life cycle typically includes phases of requirements engineering design implementation testing and maintenance 13 Meanwhile humanities research generally aims to observe transcribe and seek to understand human experience While engineering and humanities projects both consider audiences in engineering the audience is the consumer of a product who generates the goal through some need or desire In the humanities however the author draws material from the empirical world to articulate questions that address problems Humanities research can be seen as a form of both translation and authorial self expression the audience that consumes the research output is considered but likely not the primary driver of the output A humanities research life cycle would occur in roughly this order project formulation data gathering writing editing submission for peer review revision and publication The design of output takes place after data collection and before and during writing and the text becomes the final product that appears to require no maintenance after publication even if it may attract external critique and response Humanities research has an interest in process and change yet its outcomes as in published findings as text are in general static and unchanging 14 If these textual products are mostly unchanging compared to software products these methodology differences become even starker when considering Agile software development Agile software development is iterative rather than move from extensive requirements analysis to a final product over months or years the developer rapidly cycles through requirements design implementation and test often in cycles of two weeks or less Its overall philosophy emphasises working software customer focus collaboration and flexibility thus welcoming change <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> et al 2003 To align with these Agile values the developer usually breaks up product ideas into small pieces of functionality to build a minimum viable product for immediate feedback This feedback may take the form of user testing A B testing a kind of semi controlled experiment or clickstream data the goal is to discover whether or not the software is solving problems Based on this feedback the team can move on to the next iteration and improve the product more quickly at lower cost and with fewer risks Hence the project is never finished but is continuously evolving 15 Agile project management has become widespread among software developers A recent <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett Packard</ORGANIZATION> survey noted that the majority of their respondents used at least some Agile styles in their project management for reasons including enhanced collaboration better quality software increased customer satisfaction decreased time to market and lower costs <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett Packard</ORGANIZATION> 2015 Moreover this style of development aligns with such Tech mantras as fail fast fail often and move fast and break things which emphasise rapid learning and especially learning through mistakes This emphasis on failure and breakage is part of a self critique process a constant search for refinement This differs from anthropology where critiques of a textual product mostly occur after submission or publication and arise from differences in opinion and interpretation more than from outright personal failure What s the Problem Requirements Analysis 16 Software development cyclical or otherwise typically kicks off with a phase of requirements engineering Here technical team members engage with stakeholders and potential users to determine software needs At the core of requirements engineering is the question What is the problem we are trying to solve When problems are clearly defined and analysed the engineer can design an appropriate solution For the anthropologist the creation of a research question begins with the individual scholar and is usually generated from previous research encounters with the people whose ideas and activities become the center of study or other serendipitous interactions 17 Web development is concerned with problem solving but the digital humanities brings challenges because the question What is the problem we are trying to solve is not always immediately answerable sometimes the research questions change as the research is gathered sorted and contemplated To illustrate this challenge in contemporary software development the design product and engineering teams often write user stories These user stories take the format As a X type of user I want to Y do something so that I can Z accomplish some goal 18 The user story format above somewhat mirrors <PERSON>Booth Colomb</PERSON> and <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> description of the research process in the humanities which involves a topic a research question and a research motivator or a meta level statement about the world around us that advances knowledge I am studying X topic because I want to know more about Y research question to help my reader understand Z research motivator Booth et al 2003 52 19 These stories are meant to drive feature design and development in software engineering and to justify academic interest and investment in humanities research combined they represent the first step in the digital humanities creative process It is important to stress that the user story seeks to satisfy an audience and to encourage empathetic thinking to tailor a solution to the audience s needs while the Booth Colomb and <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> framework seeks self expression with a transformative effect on the reader which is generally one way 20 In the digital humanities the user story variables are not so easily filled particularly when considering the goal of the user One user story for Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> might be As a student of Japanese I want to hear see feel the culture of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> so that I can better enhance my learning of the language history and culture through deeper engagement with the ethnographic field Another could be As a person interested in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and things Japanese I want to hear see unusual sounds images of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> that go beyond the typical travel book textbook promotional website to satisfy my curiosity about this place and its people Thus project goals were relatively abstract rather the anthropologists began with their desire to trigger ideas feelings and associations in users and to transmit cross cultural understanding through the digital expression of sensory and affective experience The web developer had to link knowhow amp know why from the anthropologists to the public via the eventual website <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> 2010 119 As such the user stories for a site like Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> demonstrate evolving relationships between knowledge audiences and technology The Internet facilitates circulation of knowledge and the web developer plays a critical role as knowledge broker between users and scholars <ORGANIZATION>Developing Sonic Japan</ORGANIZATION> 21 The idea of a sonic focused website was inspired by a rich body of research in anthropology In the past few decades a somatic turn in the humanities and social sciences has inspired an internationally recognised field of sensory anthropology which rightly points out an over reliance on the visual and the auditory in anthropology <PERSON>Classen</PERSON> et al 1994 Howes 2003 <PERSON>Erlmann</PERSON> noted that even for those writing about sound instead of examining scores or meanings that are the result of acts of inscription we should instead focus on the materiality of communication and issues of sensuality Erlmann 2004 2 How to best achieve this however has puzzled social scientists for generations <PERSON>Charles Seeger</PERSON> the forefather of American ethnomusicology addressed these limitations of text and declared that speech and music are incompatible as modes of communication and indeed that we should be musicking about music Seeger 1977 179 It follows that we should be sounding about sound more generally 22 Thus by emphasising sound the anthropologists in this project hoped to encourage the user to focus on and think critically about auditory details and how sound is produced linking the sound to action and in some cases intent They thought a focus on sound might also help to take the user out of his or her visual and intellectual comfort zone by destabilising the sensory focus of the experience opening up new channels for interpreting cultural information We can never fully share a sensory moment but can help our audiences imagine that moment with the aid of a number of sensory and other cues <PERSON>Kohn</PERSON> 19994 25 23 To support the reception of aural data we considered a variety of visualisation methods to portray sound through a browser based user interface In fact Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> joins a tradition of digital projects arising from sensory anthropology urban studies ecoacoustics sound art and even technology startups that present sound recordings through the web and mobile apps For example repositories of user uploaded sound recordings like Soundcloud or Foundbite make sounds including field recordings accessible with search and social features Archivists like those at the <ORGANIZATION>British Library</ORGANIZATION> have also undertaken this endeavour On the browser geographic sound maps like the MoMA Sound Map or the <ORGANIZATION>University of Turin Bell Labs</ORGANIZATION> s Chatty Maps interactive graphs 4 or video game like experiences like Sounds of Street View create highly interactive multi sensory experiences of sound that depart from the primacy of text capitalise on browser technology and invite engagement from broader audiences However the researchers noted that these technologies often fail to provide anthropological context and were impressed with sound blogs like the Sensory Studies Sound Gallery which pair sound recordings with ethnographic description 5 Ultimately the Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> team decided that it wanted a product with the voice and context of a blog the spatiality of a soundmap the searchability of a Soundcloud and the interactivity of a graph or immersive experience aiming for a holistic representation reinforcing our view that sound is a complex whole 24 The Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> project could be seen as a gateway which sought to combine both the goals and processes of the two disciplines involved Our process was as following After initial discussion of the anthropologists requirements which at times appeared nebulous and difficult to measure to the web developer she started designing with pen and paper drawings later expanding to build mock ups and dummy prototypes She then developed working prototypes concentrating on small segments of functionality which were critically reviewed by the anthropologists as well as university IT advisors By participating in design and examination of prototypes all the team members were encouraged to think with empathy about the user refine the story they wanted to tell and consider the implications of varying visual communication choices 25 The anthropologists often found the Agile style confusing because of the wealth of possibilities and multiple and frequent decisions about which direction to take This recalls <PERSON>Schreibman Sievers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Unsworth</PERSON> s comment on how collaboration with computer scientists pushes humanities scholars out of their comfort zone <PERSON>Schreibman</PERSON> et al 2004 Moreover prototyping revealed design questions that provoked the anthropologists to defend their choices of subject matter and claims of relevance to a wider audience In many ways this validated the Agile style as we felt we were moving quickly toward a stronger product by examining its actual sensory effect though we lacked the financial resources to conduct real user testing Overall we sought to strike a balance between user focused design and the presentation of academic ideas with a revealing dialogue emerging as a result Design Issues Discovered 26 To illustrate the collaboration s effect on anthropological research the following section describes various presentation issues discovered during the prototyping process In each case discussions during the collaborative design process led the anthropologists to better define their desires for Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as research output and to rethink how their data would fit into the web medium 27 For example representation how to locate the sounds in space meant that the basic sound files needed to be associated with a series of metadata For the anthropologists this raised a number of issues What photos should be associated with a sound The photo of the object person or machine that made the sound the landscape in which the sound was produced Another design issue was that of curation of material Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did not need to be curated sound data could be presented without significant editorial commentary but rather a small amount of metadata focusing instead on the less personal properties of the sounds such as audio categorical or geographical to encourage a user to explore on her own for example through an interactive graph But after initial design discussion the anthropologists felt their main contribution to the project was not only the recording of sounds but also the value added commentary that would augment the user s experience by relating the sensory experiences of the anthropologist at the time of recording This is consistent with <PERSON>Burdick</PERSON> and colleagues who characterise the digital humanities partly by an emphasis upon curation as a defining feature of scholarly practice <PERSON>Burdick</PERSON> et al 2012 121 Hence Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> organises its sounds around the notions of Places and Themes partially to introduce geographical and cultural concepts to those without background knowledge of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Further rather than publishing sounds without comment we added titles textual descriptions and blog posts to enhance accessibility interest and understanding through academic curation 28 image Figure 1 Map markers are linked to contextual information about the sound recording image Figure 2 Blog post snippets give researcher perspectives and analyses 29 The anthropologists also debated the use of crowdsourcing Many sound maps and other websites utilise crowdsourcing through user contribution This heightens the potential for gathering large amounts of data introduces a multiplicity of perspective and invites a continuous stream of fresh content However after reviewing prototypes the team decided against extensive use of crowdsourcing because they questioned whether these additional voices and perspectives might push aside the researchers unique contributions to the project as in the curation and contextualisation issues described above For example for Place and Theme page visuals the team considered supplementing the researchers images with user generated photos from Flickr which provides user uploaded photos through its API Yet the anthropologists raised concerns over the appropriateness of random draws of images from Flickr as prototypes revealed that user generated photos sometimes created inappropriate or misleading associations with our data for instance with the API sometimes presenting tourist photos with a potentially Orientalist framing In general non contextualised data could be misleading such as offering up sounds of traffic in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> potentially creating an image of a congested polluted city devoid of the quiet green spaces which exist there too or only presenting the sounds of traditional music frozen in time without explaining its role in contemporary society 30 The final design issue considered during prototyping was the privacy of human subjects captured in the recordings Geolocation technology creates the potential for individuals to be unknowingly and perhaps unwillingly tracked as well as personally identified Deciding which recordings should be disassociated with geo data to protect subject anonymity was difficult Though we did not identify the subjects names some of our recordings contain fully audible conversations These were recorded in places that could be construed as public but given that people s movements often align with spatial and temporal habits we envisioned potential privacy infringement Further many people conduct private conversations in public spaces believing that no one is listening and some conversations may have been recorded without all of the speakers knowledge or consent Yet we also considered that sound is spontaneous and moves in and through private and public spaces which naturally brings potential for privacy infringement Upon examination of Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> s automatically generated sound maps the anthropologists decided to protect only the spatial anonymity of vulnerable subjects such as children and patients at an alcohol treatment centre by masking the exact locations of these recordings other sounds were presented without anonymity 31 All of the above issues exemplify the effect of Agile web development on the creation of an anthropology focused web application In the Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> case the prototypes presented at weekly meetings helped the anthropologists clarify their desires for a sound website as curated research output that would highlight their unique perspectives and emphasise contextualisation of the sounds while still providing value to a variety of users In other words the web developer brokered sessions where her knowledge was harnessed to explain possibilities of her design as well as to forecast the format s limitations Not all of the anthropologists wishes could be answered but in these failed attempts the researchers gained new perspectives on their data These discussions added new layers to a research project previously focused mainly on recording sounds and producing written commentary a positive effect through occasional bad gateways Beyond Prototypes Methodology Issues 32 Rapid prototyping brought Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> s design questions over visualisation curation and privacy to light which lent support for the Agile style Yet for the web developer this project eventually lent support for multiple product development and engineering methodologies creating new learning on the digital side of this digital humanities collaboration 33 For example one criticism of Agile is that while it avoids over engineering in favor of flexibility and working code it can lead to under engineering especially by novices who are overly concerned with shipping features instead of sound technical design see <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> et al 2003 Rakitin objects that Agile s focus on working software is an attempt to legitimize hacker behavior Rakitin 2001 4 Indeed Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> s web developer eventually had to refactor application code to introduce appropriate abstractions While this repayment of technical debt Krutchen et al 2012 does not necessarily invalidate Agile development it illustrates the need to strike a balance between rapid prototyping and a more planned style of engineering In another example when developing a content management system for uploading sounds and entering sound metadata frequent emergent bugs both invited code repair and lent credence to methodologies like Test Driven Development TDD in which tests are written before implementation different from the previously described software development lifecycle As per <PERSON>Janzen</PERSON> and Saiedian TDD s test writing is essentially an analysis step that should clarify code requirements and improve code quality by encouraging early refactoring <PERSON>Janzen</PERSON> and Saiedian 2005 For Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> the developer learned the value of TDD through literal breakages during development 34 Further once the web application was deployed the developer as product manager quickly perceived a lack of data support in favour of the initially chosen designs Though the team had iterated to ensure alignment with research needs the product manager did not have any hard numbers nor even anecdotal feedback proving that Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was achieving goals of reaching users of introducing users to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and sensory anthropology and of triggering feelings and associations Thus we needed to track user actions through web analytics Data from web analytics caused the developer to question design decisions For example initial data revealed low user engagement with the website s sound maps with many users leaving the map page without interacting with the sounds Highlighting the anthropology commentary in the form of blog posts instead of maps however gave different results and this data provided concrete evidence in support of curation 35 Furthermore with analytics data the developer refined project priorities on the whole toward a system of formalised project goals and metrics For example the analytics data revealed that few people were actually visiting the site since the team had not initially focused on marketing or distribution After all one of our goals was to break out of what <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> has called the ivory tower model of research communication <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> 2013 50 to make publications and recent knowledge accessible to a wide variety of readers Did our data indicate that the digital format was not helping this project to reach a wide variety of readers The developer as product manager decided the project needed to focus more on distribution and progress toward this goal would be measured by unique visits search engine rankings social media followers and or subscribers Hence the developer product manager began to work within a new framework of goals measurement and specific tactics to align with both goals and data 36 The project proved to be a continuous evolution not only in terms of design and implementation but also in terms of methodology process and management style Thus the developer besides negotiating between the researchers and software also began to negotiate between the project on the whole and the outside world Through failures bad gateway errors and dismal analytics data the developer learned the importance of different methodologies even for a project that initially seemed to lack of concrete problem definition Conclusion 37 How scholars study the social world how they see the world how they record it how they relate their version of the world to others and how readers react to the stories presented by others is increasingly mediated through communication technologies These technologies afford new ways of capturing and sharing ideas creating a new record of social life that that can be conceived as truly beyond the text Technologies do not just mediate the outcomes however they have the potential to frame inquiry from the start into new and exciting territory encompassing the sensorial experience albeit a mediated one that the text cannot always deliver 38 This article has charted the ups and downs of an ongoing collaboration between anthropologists and web developers and how brokerage led to problem solving it also demonstrates that provides an opportunity for us to think about the ways in interdisciplinary research advances in stops and starts rather than in smooth progression which we move forward in this relationship As a case study in interdisciplinary collaboration in the digital humanities Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> provided an opportunity for web developers and anthropologists despite their differences in their definition of data goals disciplinary values and methodology to create new knowledge While these differences may lead to friction confusion and errors when developing a web application they can also lead to positive outcomes The interdisciplinary nature of the Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> project prompted new ways of thinking for team members in both web development and anthropology research as the design and development process brought a host of challenges to light These challenges spanned design issues as well as methodology The anthropologists grappled with the best way to represent their data in the web medium struggling with the need to monitor their level of curation and maintain location privacy in an ethical way Meanwhile the web developer sought to bring the anthropologists research practices within methodological frameworks of product management and software engineering despite their preference for flexibility Rapid prototyping and testing revealed issues anthropological technical and even managerial demonstrating the value in continuous iteration for this interdisciplinary exercise Thus our experience creating Sonic <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> can serve as an illustrative example of an interdisciplinary developmental process We speak to our case study as a transformative journey rather than a destination a journey that traversed various disciplinary gateways Notes 1 Note that the pronoun we is used throughout the paper when referring to actions and ideas shared by the interdisciplinary team When designers and anthropologists are isolated in their experience this will be indicated appropriately 2 The sound data was collected as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Research Council</ORGANIZATION> project Sonic Japan DP130102035 and involved the researchers travelling to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to conduct ethnographic fieldwork in different locations collecting sound recordings of different events and activities accompanied by interpretative text 3 This internship was initially for 12 weeks and was then extended into a research assistant position attached to the research project 4 See for example an
