                <p>Named Entity Recognition (NER), search, classification and tagging of names and
                    name-like informational elements in texts, has become a standard information
                    extraction procedure for textual data. NER has been applied to many types of
                    texts and different types of entities: newspapers, fiction, historical records,
                    persons, locations, chemical compounds, protein families, animals etc. In
                    general, the performance of a NER system is genre- and domain-dependent and also
                    used entity categories vary [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#nadeau2007">Nadeau and Sekine 2007</a>]. The most general set of
                    named entities is usually some version of a tripartite categorization of
                    locations, persons, and organizations. In this paper we report trials and
                    evaluation of NER with data from a digitized Finnish historical newspaper
                    collection (Digi). Experiments, results, and discussion of this research serve
                    development of the web collection of historical Finnish newspapers. </p>
                <p><em class="term">Digi</em> collection contains 1,960,921 pages of newspaper material from
                    1771–1910 in both Finnish and Swedish. We use only material of Finnish documents
                    in our evaluation. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of OCR errors; its
                    estimated word level correctness is about 70–75 % [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#kettunen2016">Kettunen and Pääkkönen 2016</a>].
                    Our principal NE tagger is a rule-based tagger of Finnish, <em class="term">FiNER</em>,

We also show results of limited category
                    semantic tagging with tools of the <a href="http://seco.cs.aalto.fi/" onclick="window.open('http://seco.cs.aalto.fi/'); return false" class="ref">Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo)</a> of the Aalto University.
                    Three other tools are also evaluated briefly.</p>
                <p>This paper reports the first large scale results of NER in a historical Finnish
                    OCRed newspaper collection. Results of this research supplement NER results of
                    other languages with similar noisy data. As the results are also achieved with a
                    small and morphologically rich language, they illuminate the relatively
                    well-researched area of Named Entity Recognition from a new perspective. </p>

                    and historical newspapers are considered more and more as an important source of

                    harvesting the data are needed to gather information and to add structure to the
                    unstructured mass [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#marrero2013">Marrero et al. 2013</a>]. Named Entity Recognition has

                    and mark semantic entities like persons, locations, and organizations in texts
                    to enable information extraction related to these kinds of entities. Later on

                    browsing the historical newspapers (i.e. new ways to structure, access, and,
                    possibly, enhance information). Different types of names, especially person
                    names and names of locations, are frequently used as search terms in different
                    newspaper collections [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#crane2006">Crane and Jones 2006</a>]. They can also provide browsing
                    assistance to collections if the names are recognized, tagged in the newspaper
                    data, and put into the index [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#neudecker2014">Neudecker et al. 2014</a>]. A fine example of
                    applying name recognition to historical newspapers is La Stampa’s historical
                    newspaper collection<a class="noteRef" href="kettunen-old.html#d6466e347">[5]</a>. After basic keyword
                    searches, users can browse or filter the search results by using three basic NER
                    categories of <em class="emph">person</em> (authors of articles or persons mentioned in
                    the articles), <em class="emph">location</em> (countries and cities mentioned in the
                    articles) and <em class="emph">organization</em>. Thus named entity annotations of
                    newspaper text allow a more semantically-oriented exploration of content of the
                    larger archive. Another large scale (152M articles) NER analysis of the

                        instead locating all entities that can be linked to strong identifiers
                        elsewhere. Through these it is then, for example, possible to source
                        coordinates for identified places or associate different name variants and
                        spellings to a single individual. For the pure entity recognition task
                        presented in this paper, ARPA is thus at a disadvantage. However, we wanted
                        to see how it would fare in comparison to FiNER. </div>

                        century Finnish, we needed to create one first. As evaluation data we used
                        samples from different decades out of the Digi collection. Kettunen and
                        Pääkkönen calculated, among other things, number of words in the data for
                        different decades [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#kettunen2016">Kettunen and Pääkkönen 2016</a>]. It turned out that most of
                        the newspaper data was published in 1870–1910, and beginning and middle of
                        the 19th century had much less published material. About 95% of the material
                        was printed in 1870–1910, and most of it, 82.7%, in the two decades of
                        1890–1910.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="kettunen-old.html#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">We aimed for an evaluation collection of 150,000 words. To emphasize the
                        importance of the 1870–1910 material we took 50K of data from time period
                        1900–1910, 10K from 1890–1899, 10K from 1880–1889, and 10K from 1870–1879.
                        The remaining 70K of the material was picked from time period of 1820–1869.
                        Thus the collection reflects most of the data from the century but is also
                        weighed to the end of the 19th century and beginning of 20th century.
                        Decade-by-decade word recognition rates in Kettunen and Pääkkönen show that
                        word recognition rate during the whole 19th century is quite even, variation
                        being maximally 10% units for the whole century [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#kettunen2016">Kettunen and Pääkkönen 2016</a>]. In the latter part of the 19th century variation of recognition of words
                        is maximally 4% units. Thus we believe that temporal dimension of the data
                        should not bring great variation to the NER results. It may be possible,
                        however, that older data has old names that are out of the scope of our

                        the whole newspaper collection’s word level quality: about 73% of the words
                        in the evaluation collection can be recognized by a modern Finnish

                        by FiNER, which is not surprising as the quality of the text data is quite
                        low. Recognition of multipart entities is mostly very low. Some part of the
                        entities may be recognized, but rest is not. Out of multiword entities
                        person names and educational organizations are recognized best. Names of
                        persons are the most frequent category. Recall of one part person names is
                        best, but its precision is low. Multipart person names have a more balanced
                        recall and precision, and their F-score is 40–45. If the three different
                        locations (<em class="term">LocGpl</em>, <em class="term">LocPpl</em> and <em class="term">LocXxx</em>)
                        are joined in strict evaluation as one general location,
                        <em class="term">LocXxx</em>, one part locations get precision of 65.69, recall of
                        50.27, and F-score of 56.96 with 1533 tags. Multipart locations are found
                        poorly even then. FiNER seems to have a tendency to tag most of the
                            <em class="term">LocPpl</em>s as <em class="term">LocXxx</em>s. <em class="term">LocGpl</em>s are
                        also favored instead of <em class="term">LocPpl</em>s. On the other hand, only one
                        general location like LocXxx could be enough for our purposes, and these
                        results are reasonably good</div>

                        SeCo’s ARPA. We first analyzed ARPA’s lexical coverage with the same word
                        list that was used with FiNER. ARPA recognized in the recognition word list
                        (of 75,980 tokens) 74,068 as either locations or persons (97.4 %). 67,046
                        were recognized as locations, and 37,456 as persons. 30,434 names were
                        tagged as both persons and locations. Among the 1912 names that were not
                        recognized by ARPA were the same kind of foreign names that were left
                        unrecognized by FiNER. 13% of the unrecognized names were compounds with
                        hyphen, such as Esa-Juha, Esa-Juhani. This type could be easily handled by
                        ARPA with minor modifications to configuration. In general, the test showed
                        that ARPA’s lexicons are more comprehensive than those of FiNER.</div>

                        examining raw results from the test run, three issues were identified for
                        further improvement. First, PNR contains only modern Finnish place names. To
                        improve recall, three registries containing historical place names were
                        added: 1) the Finnish spatiotemporal ontology SAPO [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#hyvonen2011">Hyvönen et al. 2011</a>] containing names of historic municipalities, 2)
                        a repository of old Finnish maps and associated places from the 19th and
                        early 20th Century, and 3) a name registry of places inside historic
                        Karelia, which does not appear in PNR due to being ceded by Finland to the
                        Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#ikkala2016">Ikkala et al. 2016</a>].
                        To account for international place names, the names were also queried
                        against the Geonames database<a class="noteRef" href="kettunen-old.html#d6466e1337">[17]</a> as
                        well as Wikidata<a class="noteRef" href="kettunen-old.html#d6466e1343">[18]</a>.
                        The contributions of each of these resources to the number of places
                        identified in the final runs are shown in Table 3. Note that a single place
                        name can be, and often was found in multiple of these sources.</div>

                        while recall in the first test run was high, precision was low. Analysis
                        revealed this to be due to many names being both person names as well as
                        places. Thus, a filtering step was added, that removed 1) hits identified as
                        person names by the morphological analyzer and 2) hits that matched regular
                        expressions catching common person name patterns found in the data (I.
                        Lastname and FirstName LastName). However, sometimes this was too
                        aggressive, ending up, for example, in filtering out also big cities like
                            <em class="emph">Tampere</em> and <em class="emph">Helsinki</em>. Thus, in the final
                        configuration, this filtering was made conditional on the size of the
                        identified place, as stated in the structured data sources matched
                        against.</div>

                        be a major hurdle in accurate recognition, experiments were made with
                        sacrificing precision in favor of recall through enabling various levels of
                        Levenshtein distance matching against the place name registries. In this
                        test, the fuzzy matching was done in the query phase after lexical
                        processing. This was easy to do, but doing the fuzzy matching during lexical
                        processing would probably be more optimal as lemma guessing (which is needed
                        because OCR errors are out of the lemmatizer’s vocabulary) is currently
                        extremely sensitive to OCR errors–particularly in the suffix parts of

                            language technology project, the aim of which was to discover an optimal
                            way of catering to the needs of dictionary users in modern electronic
                            dictionaries by utilizing state-of-the-art language technology. Semantic
                            tagging in its rule-oriented form (vs. statistical learning) can be
                            briefly defined as a dictionary-based process of identifying and
                            labeling the meaning of words in a given text according to some
                            classification. FST is not a NER tool as such; it has first and foremost
                            been developed for the analysis of full text. </div>

                            as part of the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) framework [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#rayson2004">Rayson et al. 2004</a>], and both these equivalent semantic taggers
                            were utilized in the Benedict project in the creation of a
                            context-sensitive search tool for a new intelligent dictionary. In
                            different evaluations the FST has been shown to be capable of dealing

                            Finnish, evaluation results have shown that the lexical resources are
                            also applicable to the analysis of both older Finnish text and the more
                            informal type of writing found on the Web. In addition, the semantic
                            lexical resources can be tailored for various domain-specific tasks
                            thanks to the flexible USAS category system. The semantically
                            categorized single word lexicon of the FST contains 46,225 entries and
                            the multiword expression lexicon contains 4,422 entries [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#piao2016">Piao et al. 2016</a>], representing all parts of speech. There are
                            plans to expand the semantic lexical resources for the FST by adding
                            different types of proper names in the near future in order to tailor
                            them for NER tasks. </div>

                        which consist of first name and last name. In strict evaluation ARPA appears
                        better with locations than FiNER, but this is due to the fact that FiNER has
                        a more fine-grained location tagging. With one location tag FiNER performs
                        equally well as ARPA. In loose evaluation they both seem to find almost
                        equally well locations and persons, but FiNER gets slightly better results.
                        FiNER finds educational organizations best, although they are scarce in the
                        data. Corporations are also found relatively well, even though this category
                        is prone to historical changes. FiNER is precise in finding two part street
                        names, but recall in street name tagging is low. High precision is most
                        likely due to common part <span class="foreign i">–katu</span> in street
                        names: they are easy to recognize, if they are spelled right in the data.

                        FINER and ARPA in loose evaluation. Its F-score with locations was the best
                        performance overall. Polyglot performed worst of all the systems.</div>

                        contained 75,980 names. ARPA’s lexical coverage of the names was by far the
                        best as it was able to recognize 97.4% of the names. FiNER recognized 73% of

                        names. It marked about 62% of the names as unknown. Thus it seems that very
                        high lexical coverage of names may not be the key issue in NER, as all three
                        tools performed tagging of locations at the same level. The FST performed
                        worst with persons although it had clearly more person names than locations

                        had achieved our evaluation results, we evaluated FiNER’s context
                        sensitivity with a small test. Table 13 shows effect of different contexts
                        on FiNER’s tagging for 320 names of municipalities. In the leftmost column
                        are results, where only a name list was given to FiNER. In the three
                        remaining columns, names of the municipality was changed from the beginning
                        of a clause to middle and end. Results imply that there is context
                        sensitivity in FiNER’s tagging. With no context at all results are worst,
                        and when the location is at the beginning of the sentence, FiNER also misses
                        more tags than in the other two positions. Overall it tags about two thirds
                        of the municipality names as locations (<em class="term">LocXxx</em> and
                            <em class="term">LocGpl</em>) in all the three context positions. The high number
                        of municipalities tagged as persons is partly understandable as names are
                        ambiguous, but in many cases interpretation as a person is not well
                        grounded. This phenomenon derives clearly from FiNER’s tagging strategy that
                        was explained at the end of section 2.1. At the beginning of the clause
                        locations are not confused as much as persons, but this comes with a cost of
                        more untagged names.</div>

                        tools on historical texts faces three challenges: 1) noisy input texts, 2)
                        lack of coverage in linguistic resources, and 3) dynamics of language. In
                        our case the first obstacle is the most obvious, which will be shown in more
                        detail. Lack of coverage in linguistic resources (e.g. in the form of
                        missing old names in the lexicons of the NE tools) is also a considerable
                        source of errors in our case, as our tools are made for modern Finnish. With
                        dynamics of language Ehrmann et al. refer to different rules and conventions
                        for the use of written language in different times. In this respect late
                        19th century Finnish is not that different from current Finnish, but this
                        can certainly affect the results and should be studied more thoroughly.
                        Considering that all our NE tools are made for modern Finnish, our
                        evaluation data is heavily out of their main scope [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#poibeau2001">Poibeau and Kosseim 2001</a>], even if ARPA uses historical Finnish aware

                        additional trials with improved OCR material. We made tests with three
                        versions of a 500,000 word text material that is different from our NER
                        evaluation material but derives from the 19th century newspapers as well.
                        One version was manually corrected OCR, another an old OCRed version, and
                        third a new OCRed version. Besides character-level errors, word order errors
                        have been corrected in the two new versions. For these texts we did not have
                        a ground truth NE tagged version, and thus we could only count number of NE
                        tags in different texts. With FiNER total number of tags increased from
                        23,918 to 26,674 (+11.5% units) in the manually corrected text version.
                        Number of tags increased to 26,424 tags (+10.5% units) in the new OCRed text
                        version. Most notable were increases in the number of tags in the categories
                            <em class="term">EnamexLocStr</em> and <em class="term">EnamexOrgEdu</em>. With ARPA,
                        results were even slightly better. ARPA recognized 10,853 places in the old
                        OCR, 11,847 in the new OCR (+9.2% units) and 13,080 (+20.5 % units) in the
                        ground truth version of the text. Thus there is about a 10–20 % unit overall
                        increase in the number of NE tags in both of the new better quality text
                        versions in comparison to the old OCRed text with both taggers.</div>

                        the following observation: when the words in all the correctly tagged FiNER
                            <em class="term">Enamex</em>es of the evaluation data are analyzed with Omorfi,
                        only 14.3% of them are unrecognized. With wrongly tagged FiNER
                            <em class="term">Enamex</em>es 26.3% of the words are unrecognized by Omorfi. On
                        tag level the difference is even clearer, as can be seen in recognition

                        the other hand, the tagger also tags common nouns with upper case initial as

                        documentation of the tagger we are inclined to believe that upper case
                        detection is one of the cues for person name detection in the tagger. This
                        favours detection of misspelled person names even without any handling of
                        typographical errors as such. It can also bring quite odd errors that we
                        listed – these words have nothing in common with person names. Especially
                        odd is the error with <span class="foreign i">Telefooni</span>
                            (“telephone”) which is many times followed by a
                        number, and the whole is presenting a phone number. Both the word <span class="foreign i">Telefooni</span> and the number are tagged as person
                        names. Also some title-like words before person names are tagged as persons,
                        although they are not names of persons. With regards to locations, Connexor
                        seems to be more cautious: most of its locations are correct spellings of
                        words. Only a few misspellings like <span class="foreign i">Suomuzsalmi</span> and <span class="foreign i">Siräiöniemi</span>
                        are analyzed right as locations. In this case it seems that the correctly

                        street name recognition are due to three main reasons: OCR errors in street
                        names, abbreviated street names, and multipart street names with numbers as
                        part of the name. In principle streets are easy to recognize in Finnish,
                        while they have most of the time common part -<span class="foreign i">katu
                            </span>(“street”) as last part of their name,
                        which is usually a compound word or a phrase. Common use of abbreviations
                        with street names seems to be characteristic for the data and it can be
                        considered as a style of writing for the era. Street name like <span class="foreign i">Aleksanterinkatu</span> would be written as <span class="foreign i">Aleksanterink.</span></div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="kettunen-old.html#p72">72</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p72">Another similar case are first name initials which are used a lot in 19th

                        name initial with surname, there can also be more initials) are common.
                        FiNER gets initials right if they are preceded by a title, but otherwise
                        not, and thus it gets these mostly wrong. The FST is not able to analyse
                        these at all. Connexor’s tagger gets one initial right if it is followed by
                        surname, but out of two initials it only analyses the second one. This kind
                        of writing of names belongs also to Ehrmann et al’s dynamics of language
                        type of challenges [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#ehrmann2016a">Ehrmann et al. 2016a</a>]. Usage of initials only for
                        first names was common in the 19th century Finnish newspapers, but it is not
                        used in modern newspaper writing.</div>

                        some name types. Many Finnish surnames can be also names of locations,
                        either names of municipalities, villages or houses. These kind of names are
                        e.g. <span class="foreign i">Marttila, Liuhala,</span> and <span class="foreign i">Ketola.</span> All our taggers make errors with these,
                        as only contextual cues specify whether the name is used as a person name or
                        as a name of location. Proper handling of these names would need some extra
                        disambiguation effort from the taggers. Although FiNER has a pattern
                        matching mechanism for these (cf. 2.1) it also makes errors with ambiguous

                    utilizing different kinds of morphological analysis, gazetteers, and pattern and
                    context rules. The only exception was Polyglot. However, while there has been
                    some recent work on rule-based systems for NER [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#kokkinakis2014">Kokkinakis et al. 2014</a>],
                    the most prominent research on NER has focused on statistical machine learning
                    methodology [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#nadeau2007">Nadeau and Sekine 2007</a>]. Therefore, we are currently developing
                    a statistical NE tagger for historical Finnish text. For training and evaluating
                    the statistical system, we are manually annotating newspaper and magazine text
                    from the years 1862–1910 with classes for person, organization, and location.
                    The text contains approximately 650,000 word tokens. After annotation we can
                    utilize freely available toolkits, such as the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer,
                    for teaching the NE tagger. We expect that the rich feature sets enabled by
                    statistical learning will alleviate the effect of poor OCR quality on the
                    recognition accuracy of NEs. Preliminary unpublished results comparing FiNER and
                    adjusted Stanford NER for modern Finnish business newspaper data show that
                    Stanford NER outperforms FiNER with about 30% units in combined results of five
                    name categories. For recent work on successful statistical learning of NE
                    taggers for historical data, see [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#neudecker2016">Neudecker 2016</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kettunen-old.html#p80">80</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p80">On general level, there are a few lessons to be learned from our experiments for
                    those that are working with other small languages that do not have a
                    well-established repertoire of NER tools available. Some of them are well known,
                    but worth repeating, too. First and most self-evidently, bad OCR was found to be
                    the main obstacle for good quality NER once again. This was shown clearly in
                    section 2.10. The implications of this are clear: better quality data is needed
                    to make NER working well enough to be useful. Second, slightly surprisingly, we
                    noticed that differences in lexical coverage of the tools will not show that
                    much in the NER results. ARPA had clearly the best lexical coverage of the tools
                    and FST the worst coverage, but their NER performance with locations are quite
                    equal. This could imply that very large lexicons for a NE tagger are not
                    necessary and a good basic coverage lexicon is enough, but this could also be
                    language specific. Third, we showed that historical language can be processed to
                    a reasonable extent with tools that are made for modern language if nothing else
                    is available. However, if best possible results need to be achieved, more
                    historical data oriented tools need to be used. It is also possible that the
                    quite short time frame of our material enhances performance of our tools.
                    Fourth, results of The Finnish Semantic Tagger showed that NER does not need to
                    be only a task for dedicated NER tools. This has also been shown with modern
                    Finnish [<a class="ref" href="kettunen-old.html#kettunen2017a">Kettunen and Löfberg 2017</a>]. FST performed almost as well in a modern
                    Finnish NER evaluation task as FiNER. Thus, at least in some cases, one can have
                    available a suitable tool for doing NER even if the tool does not look like a NE
                    tagger. Fifth, results of Polyglot hint that general multilingual packages do
                    not work very well with data of small languages if their training data was not
                    suitable for the task at hand. A lesson that we learned too was, that too
                    detailed named entity classification (original FiNER labeling) is probably not a
                    good solution for our purposes. In the future we shall stick to the use of
                    persons, locations, and organizations.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kettunen-old.html#p81">81</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p81">Our main emphasis with NER will be to use the names with the newspaper collection

                    achieved for this use, of course. A reasonable balance of P/R should be found
                    for this purpose, but also other capabilities of the software need to be
                    considered. These lingering questions must be addressed if we are to connect
