            Abstract

                
                Interest in the role of book cover images in readers’ reading experience and book
                    marketing has been long-standing. This study attempts to compare book covers
                    from different countries with a media visualization tool called ImagePlot. The
                    top 100 bestselling books from 13 Amazon.com’s international sites were
                    identified and their cover images were downloaded. Using ImagePlot, median
                    values of brightness, hue and saturation for each image in the data set were
                    extracted and analyzed. Along with one-way ANOVA tests and the resulting graphs
                    from SPSS, ImagePlot outputs show differences in these graphical properties of
                    bestsellers’ cover images in different countries. From the outputs, with all the
                    book cover images displayed on a single canvas (screen), hidden patterns emerged
                    and findings were clearly confirmed. This study makes a contribution by
                    providing connection between research interests in book cover images and media
                    visualization techniques for further research.

            

            
        
        
            
                Introduction

                1
Contrary to the real meaning of the English idiom, “Don’t judge a book by its
                        cover,” research interest in book covers has been steady ranging from the
                    personal book selection process to the marketing of trade books. For example,
                    there is an edited scholarly monograph titled Judging a
                        Book by Its Cover
                    [Matthews & Moody 2007] discussing book covers’ important roles. At
                    Goodreads.com, which is a general forum of readers, more than 400 lists related
                    to book covers have been generated by its users, which indicates readers’
                    long-standing interests in the topic. In fact, the importance of cover images
                    was clearly identified from the late 19th century, although 1930’s Penguin
                    Books’ paper revolution is generally considered as the beginning of the interest
                    in book covers [McCleery 2007]. Since the 19th century, book
                    bindings were commonly decorated on their covers or dust jackets to reflect the
                    content of the book, which is a modern development [Pearson 2013]
                    and around the same time, the growing interests in children’s book publishing
                    started to emphasize the importance of book covers to attract the readers’ eye
                    and to promote the books for sales [Immel 2013]. 

                2
Despite active research activities on book covers, however, most studies are
                    based on individual book cover images, often with different cover images of a
                    single title over time and in different countries. A new method called media
                    visualization can help to overcome this limitation, allowing researchers to
                    explore various properties of images in a collection or to compare among
                    multiple image collections. 

                3
This study compares book covers from different countries using media
                    visualization methods to explore characteristics of individual image groups and
                    differences, if any, among the different image groups. 

            

            
                Literature Review

                
                    Visualization of Image Collection for Effective Image Retrieval

                    4
There have been numerous research projects aimed at providing useful tools
                        for visualization of large image collections for both retrieval and
                        exploration purposes. Two approaches are noticeable in the existing
                        literature on visualization of image collections: user interaction and
                        semantics. 

                    5
In terms of interactive approaches, Nguyen and Worring (2005, 2008) tested
                        their interactive system with 10,000 Corel images with emphasis on overview,
                        visibility and structure preservation [Nguyen & Worring 2005]
                        [Nguyen & Worring 2008]. Bruneau, Picarougne and Gelgon (2010) proposed
                        an interactive system which allows feedback on the clustering process [Bruneau et al. 2010]. Zheng, Gomi and Itoh (2014) proposed
                            “ImageCube” designed for the browsing of image
                        collections associated with multidimensional datasets. With 15 participants,
                        they tested the interactive system with an automobile catalog dataset
                        published on the Web [Zheng et al. 2014]. Worring, Rooji and Rijn
                        (2007) created a prototype that visualizes the network of images by
                        graph-based representations and found that the nearest neighbor network can
                        have a positive effect on the interaction effort [Worring et al. 2007]. Yang et al. (2006) proposed a scalable semantic image browser which
                        allows interactive visual exploration [Yang et al. 2006]. Fan et al.
                        (2009) introduced “JustClick”, an interactive system, to
                        enable personalized image recommendation via exploratory search from
                        large-scale collections of Flickr images [Fan et al. 2009]. Their
                        experiments on large-scale image collections (1.5 billion Flickr images)
                        with diverse semantics (4000 image topics) have obtained very positive
                        results. Camargo, Caicedo and Gonzalez (2013) proposed a framework for the
                        construction of an image collection exploration system based on kernel
                        methods with mathematically strong basis of image representation,
                        summarization, visualization and interaction [Carmargo et al. 2013].
                        Gao et al. (2009) developed an interactive system to filter junk images from
                        keyword-based Google Images search results by mixture of kernels to generate
                        more accurate image clustering [Gao et al. 2009]. Janecek and Pu
                        (2003) implemented a prototype of an interactive “focus + context”
                        visualization which integrates WordNet to utilize relevant semantic
                        information such as metadata and ontologies [Janecek & Pu 2003]. 

                    6
In terms of semantic approaches, many of the literatures cited above were
                        based on textual information of images as well as graphical properties of
                        images [Fan et al. 2009]
                        [Carmargo et al. 2013]
                        [Yang et al. 2006]
                        [Gao et al. 2009]
                        [Janecek & Pu 2003]. 

                

                
                    Media Visualization

                    7
Media visualization is different from information visualization. According to
                        Manovich (2014), information visualization shows the metadata about the
                        media, while media visualization shows the actual data [Manovich 2014]. If standard information visualization
                        translates data into pictures, media visualization translate pictures into
                        pictures. Media visualization offers one solution to a fundamental question
                        of digital humanities — how to bring together macro and micro, distant
                        reading and close reading — “reading” the actual
                        artifacts and “reading” larger patterns abstracted - from
                        very large sets of these artifacts? [Manovich 2014]. 

                    8
Manovich has been one of the leading researchers in media visualization. His
                        lab developed a visualization tool called ImagePlot by creating many custom
                        macros, based on imageJ software which was developed and distributed freely
                        by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Manovich succinctly summarizes
                        the value of media visualization in the following: 
                            Step away, and you can see larger patterns across a
                                whole data collection. Step closer, and you can study the details of
                                individual images.
                             [Manovich 2014]
                        



                    9
These techniques are aimed at scholars working in a number of disciplines
                        including art, art history, film and media studies, who need to analyze
                        large image collections in their work, which led to a new interdisciplinary
                        field called Cultural Analytics [Yamaoka et al. 2011]. As an
                        exemplary study, Manovich, Douglass and Zepel (2012) downloaded one million
                        scanned manga pages from a web site and visualized the whole data by
                        ImagePlot to explore the characteristics of particular manga collections
                            [Manovich et al. 2012].

                        Cover Images in Book Marketing and Promotion

                        10
Cover art and blurbs are the No. 7 reason for buying a book, according to
                            reports from the National Endowment for the Arts [Greco et al. 2013]. Matthews and Moody (2007) compiled chapters
                            about the role of book covers in marketing and other aspects into a
                            monograph [Matthews & Moody 2007]. Yampbell (2005) examined 5
                            covers over 10 years for Weetzie Bat by Francesca Lia Block and
                            concluded that publishers are altering the paratext, particulary covers,
                            spines, and sizes, to charm teen readers [Yampbell 2005].
                            Regina Sierra Carter (2012) examined different versions of cover images
                            of YA (Young Adults) books about minority or mixed-race characters and
                            concluded that appropriate cover art is necessary because it helps to
                            match the inside story to the story the cover portrays [Carter 2012]. As seen in the example of a Portuguese
                            translated version of Shariff’s book, altering book cover images without
                            the author’s knowledge can be frustrating [Shariff 20913].
                            Croker (2012) suggested that if publishing and authorial populations
                            were involved in more conscious collaboration like Lewis Carroll, the
                            paratext could contribute to the enhancement of the reading experience
                                [Croker 2012]. After examining the text and images of
                            The Beat Goes On book jacket, Goldsmith, Gross and Carruth (2012) found
                            that although the information on the jacket conveys a strong and
                            accurate sense of the narrative, still the front and back covers do not
                            mention the disease, which may make the subject matter less clear [Goldsmith et al. 2012]. 

                    

                    
                        Cover Images in Book Selection Process

                        11
For decades in the past, the role of cover images in readers’ book
                            selection has been actively studied and the majority of studies have
                            focused on younger readers from elementary and middle schools. Reutzel
                            and Gali (1998) observed 18 elementary school children for their book
                            selection behaviors and found that looking at the cover is one of the
                            common book selection elements in children’s book selection processes
                                [Reutzel & Gali 1998]. Based on interviews with 36 children
                            (grades one through four), Carter (1988) found that structural elements,
                            including cover information (title and picture) had much more influence
                            on children’s book selection than any other schema used by children to
                            choose reading material [Carter 1988]. Wendelin and Zinck
                            (1983) conducted a survey with responses from 688 fifth through eighth
                            grade students and found that factors such as the description of a book
                            on the book jacket or back cover and the content of the first page
                            apparently weigh heavily in the decisions to read or not to read a book
                                [Hawkins Wendelin & Zinck 1983]. However, still 8% said they
                            choose a book by the picture on the cover in the first place. Kragler
                            and Nolley (1996) observed that 23% of the 17 fourth grade students in a
                            class said they chose a book based on its physical characteristics such
                            as a good-looking book cover, while 27% chose a book because others in
                            the class had read it or told them it was a good book [Kragler & Nolley 1996]. 

                        12
In a study with 96 first-through fifth-grade students on the ICDL
                            (International Children’s Digital Library), Reuter (2007) found that
                            39.6% said cover images influenced their book selection [Reuter 2007]. Mohr (2006) interviewed 122 first graders
                            and found 25% indicated “topic” as primary element
                            that influenced their book selection process, while only 7% preferred
                                “front cover”
                            [Mohr 2006]. Moss and Hendershot (2002) conducted a
                            two-year ethnographic case study with 48 sixth graders for their
                            nonfiction trade book selection for reading [Moss & Hendershot 2002].
                            48% reported that visual aspects of the text influenced their book
                            choices, whether a picture on the cover or photographs inside the book.
                            Swartz and Hendricks (2000) conducted a book selection process study
                            with 31 middle school students with special needs [Swartz & Hendricks 2000]. 15 of the 31 students said they picked a
                            book because of the pictures on the cover or illustrations in the book.
                            From a study with 25 eighth graders, Rinehart, Gerlach and Wisell (1998)
                            found that these adolescent readers were able to draw important clues
                            from BOB (back-of-the-book) summaries, titles and cover illustrations,
                            although more emphasis is on BOB rather than cover illustrations [Rinehart et al. 1998]. Based on anonymous observation methods,
                            Cunningham (2011) conducted studies on how children find books for
                            leisure reading at bookstores and public libraries and confirmed that
                            the primary basis for the “good/not good” decision is
                            the appearance of the cover [Cunningham 2011]. 

                        13
The role of cover images in book selection has been studied for the adult
                            population as well. Spiller (1980) found 27% of public library users,
                            mostly adults in the survey with 500 respondents, thought that the
                            visual impact of the cover design influenced them to pick up the book in
                            the first instance, although the cover alone would not afford enough
                            information [Spiller 1980]. Researchers at the University
                            of Waikato in New Zealand studied their college students’ browsing and
                            book selection process and found the cover images play an important role
                                [Vanderschantz et al. 2011]
                            [Timpany et al. 2012]
                            [Hinze et al. 2012]
                            [Cunningham et al. 2013]. Vanderschantz and Timpany (2013)
                            examined a sample of 840 books from their university library’s
                            collection for their physical properties of the cover (use of a dust
                            jacket, type of binding) and the contents of the cover (background
                            color, most predominant color, the imagery used and the use of
                            typography), based on the Library of Congress Classification System [Vanderschantz & Timpany 2013]. They concluded that understanding of
                            the design parameters and their variations across different subject
                            areas can assist with accurately conveying the content of a book to the
                            reader, as the initial impression of the outside of a book can have an
                            effect on whether the reader delves further into the content.

                14
The purpose of this study is, utilizing a media visualization method by
                    ImagePlot, to find if there is any difference in brightness, hue and saturation
                    of cover images of bestseller books from different countries and to identify any
                    patterns among the differences and if so, what the characteristics of the
                    differences may be.

                    Data Collection

                    15
In mid-April 2014, from Amazon.com’s 13 international sites, the cover images
                        of the top 100 bestsellers were collected. The 13 international sites
                        include: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy,
                        Japan, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom and United States. A few books did not
                        display their cover images. Table 1 shows the number of images in each
                        country’s data set with each country’s country code. Some images have white
                        borders around actual cover images or “Look Inside!”
                        icons, but due to time constraints, those images were not cropped, but used
                        in the data process as they were.

                    	Country	Number of Images	Country	Number of Images
	Australia (AU)	100	Italy (IT)	100
	Brazil (BR)	100	Japan (JP)	94
	Canada (CA)	100	Mexico (MX)	100
	China (CN)	100	Spain (ES)	99

                    Data Processing

                    16
The collected images were saved in a designated folder for each country. By
                            “ImageMeasure” macro, median values of hue,
                        brightness and saturation for each image were extracted and saved in a
                        corresponding data file for each country. For the overall visualization and
                        analysis, all the images regardless of their country origins, were collected
                        in a separate folder. Their hue, brightness and saturation values were
                        measured again and saved into another data file. In this file, the Internet
                        country code was assigned for each data entry. 

                

                
                    Visualization Tool - ImagePlot

                    17
ImagePlot was developed by Manovich and his lab colleagues with various
                        macros. It is primarily based on ImageJ software developed by and freely
                        distributed from NIH. With the ImageMeasure.txt macro, median values of
                        brightness, hue and saturation of each image in the data set was
                        automatically obtained. Brightness Median is the median of grey scale values
                        for the pixels in an image, Saturation Median is the median of saturation,
                        which means purity of color, for each pixel in an image, and Hue Median is
                        the median of color values of all pixels in an image.

                    18
In ImagePlot, all the values measured are converted into 0-255 scale
                        (ImagePlot Documentation). For brightness measurements, color images are
                        internally converted to greyscale using this formula:
                        gray=(red+green+blue)/3. If an image is pure black, Brightness_Median will
                        be 0; if an image is pure white, it will be 255. Low Saturation_Median value
                        indicates that image colors are mostly desaturated; a high value indicates
                        that most colors are close to being pure (very saturated). The 0-255 scale
                        may lead to some confusion particularly for hue values since hue values are
                        normally represented as degree of a circle, 0 to 360, from yellow to red,
                        with green, blue and purple in the middle. Therefore, when the hue values
                        are represented in a linear form, such as X-axis or Y-axis, the
                        interpretation requires extra caution. 

                

                
                    Data Analysis 

                    19
For the overall image collection, 3 sets of visualization outputs were
                        rendered by ImagePlot: brightness by country, hue by country and saturation
                        by country. For the differences among countries, one-way ANOVA analysis was
                        conducted with means and standard deviations (stdev) of the measured median
                        values of brightness, hue and saturation. Bar graphs of the result were
                        generated by the SPSS software. For combined analysis, 3 sets of bivariate
                        graphs were generated for each country’s collection by ImagePlot: brightness
                        vs. hue, brightness vs. saturation and saturation vs. hue. The output
                        bivariate graphs were compared among countries for further analysis.

                    Differences in brightness, hue and saturation by countries (ANOVA) 

                    20
A one-way ANOVA test was conducted by SPSS with the median values and
                        standard deviation values of each image for its brightness, hue and
                        saturation. The results showed that both the median values and the standard
                        deviations are significantly different statistically (p<.05) among
                        countries for all three of the properties. 

                    21
Graphical displays of the results can provide more intuitive observation. For
                        example, a graph based on the mean values for each country shows how bright
                        or dark the books from a country are in general. However, it may not show
                        how much different each group’s images are in brightness. In that sense, a
                        graph based on standard deviations is useful. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the
                        graphical displays of means and standard deviations for brightness, hue and
                        saturation respectively. The X-axis means each country represented by its
                        Internet country domain name.

                    
                        Brightness by Country

                        22
Figure 1 shows that while the book cover images from Australia and Brazil
                            have relatively dark (low value in brightness) colors, they have a wide
                            range of brightness (larger standard deviation). Meanwhile, Chinese
                            books are the brightest among countries with the most homogeneous level
                            of brightness (the smallest in standard deviation). Japanese books are
                            quite bright as well, but with modest variation.

                        Hue by Country

                        23
For hue values, a line graph can display different color tones in general
                            among countries. For example, as seen in the first graph in Figure 2,
                            the books from the United Kingdom use much higher value of hue than
                            those from China. However, since hue is based on 360-degree circular
                            measurements for RGB (red, green and blue) values, the mean value may
                            not have intuitive indicators. Rather, the standard deviation values may
                            have more useful information. For example, from the second graph in
                            Figure 2, it is reasonable to conclude that books from United Kingdom,
                            United States, Spain, India, Italy, France and Germany have more
                            consistent or homogeneous color schemes than others.

                        24
Figure 3 shows that the majority of the books in the data do not have
                            highly saturated colors. Chinese, Japanese and Australian books have the
                            least saturated colors, while French, Indian, British and American books
                            have the most saturated colors. Chinese and Mexican books have the
                            largest standard deviations in saturation, while Italian, British and
                            American books have the least.

                    25
While the graphics based on the means of median values show some useful
                        information, still a bigger picture needs to be examined for a full
                        description of the differences, and the outputs from ImagePlot provides more
                        in-depth, but still easy to identify, representation of the book cover
                        images among countries. It is also worthwhile to remember that the values
                        for hue are not numeric because red, green and blue color are arbitrarily
                        assigned to 0, 120 and 240 in a 360-degree color wheel and then later 0-255
                        into ImagePlot data file. 

                    26
The three graphs in Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the different brightness, hue
                        and saturation of each book cover image from the data by country
                        respectively. All the books in the data set were represented on the
                        individual graph, with actual images of the covers with the size of 50 by 50
                        pixels. The X-axis shows each country represented by its Internet country
                        domain name, and the Y-axis shows brightness, hue and saturation on a scale
                        of 0-255. For brightness and saturation, the lower the Y value, the darker
                        or the less saturated each image is. For hue, Y values represent, from lower
                        to higher, yellow, green, blue, purple, red colors. 

                    27
In this method, since all the actual book cover images are displayed on a
                        graph, it is easy to identify patterns throughout the whole data. For
                        example, Chinese and Japanese books do not have many dark images on their
                        covers and French, German, Indian and British books have more red/purple
                        colors on their covers. Most book covers do not have highly saturated
                        colors, but Japanese books distinctively do not have highly saturated colors
                        on their covers. It also seems that books from Brazil and Germany use either
                        highly saturated colors or lowly saturated colors, not middle range
                        saturated colors.

                        Polar vs. Non-polar display 

                        28
There are two options for visualization in ImagePlot, polar vs.
                            non-polar. Since ImagePlot converted all the values into 0-255 scale
                            regardless of their natural scale (for example, 0-360 for hue), each
                            option has its advantages and disadvantages. The polar option seems
                            fancier than the non-polar one, but the difficulty of interpretation
                            depends on which variables are used. For example, in Figure 7, it is
                            more intuitive to use the polar display because hue (red, green and blue
                            colors) is easily identified in counterclockwise direction from the
                            right side while the center represents darker and the periphery
                            represents brighter colors. However, in Figure 8, since neither
                            saturation nor brightness involves a circular data point, a polar
                            display option has little value. Rather, a simple x-y coordinate can
                            deliver easier interpretation, in this case, X-axis for brightness and
                            Y-axis for saturation. In general, a non-polar display is easier to
                            understand, while a polar display may have an advantage if hue is
                            involved.

Figure 9 shows four ImagePlot outputs for brightness and hue in the image
                            data sets from four countries, China, Japan, United Kingdom and United
                            States. X-axis is for brightness, the higher the value, the brighter the
                            image, and Y-axis for hue, from lower value to higher, representing
                            yellow, green, blue, purple and red. These outputs show that Chinese and
                            Japanese book covers are mostly brightest and less colorful, while
                            British and American book covers are not only various in color but also
                            diverse in brightness.

Figure 10 shows four ImagePlot outputs for brightness and saturation in
                            the image data sets from four countries, China, Japan, France and India.
                            X-axis is for brightness, the higher the value, the brighter the image,
                            and Y-axis for saturation, the higher the value, the more saturated. In
                            terms of brightness, French and Indian books have more dark colors on
                            their covers than Chinese and Japanese books. They also have more
                            saturated colors on their covers than Chinese and Japanese books,
                            meaning Chinese and Japanese book cover images have more white, black or
                            gray elements in their colors.

                        31
From the previous sections on Brightness vs. Hue and Brightness vs.
                            Saturation, it is clear that Chinese and Japanese books distinctively
                            have brighter and less saturated colors. In this section of Hue vs.
                            Saturation, rather subtle distinctions are explored without Chinese or
                            Japanese books.

Figure 11 shows four ImagePlot outputs for hue and saturation in the
                            image data sets from four countries, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain.
                            X-axis is for saturation and Y-axis for hue. From these graphs, it is
                            reasonable to conclude that German and Italian books have more
                            red/purple colors on their covers than Mexican and Spanish books (more
                            blue colors on Mexican and Spanish book covers as well), while Mexican
                            and Spanish books have more saturated colors relatively than German and
                            Italian books. 

                    

                

            

            
                Discussion

                
                    Differences among countries and cultures

                    33
In the previous section, ANOVA tests and their graphical outputs along with
                        the media visualizations by ImagePlot showed that there are clear
                        differences among the cover images of bestselling books in different
                        countries, in terms of their brightness, hue and saturation values. The
                        differences are clear enough to allow us to draw a cautious but reasonable
                        generalization regarding cultural difference in book cover images. For
                        example, between East Asian culture and Anglo-American culture, there are
                        distinctive differences in brightness, hue and saturation. East Asian book
                        covers tend to have brighter colors, fewer red/purple colors, and fewer
                        saturated colors than Anglo-American books covers. These differences may
                        reflect different consumer preferences in book cover images, which gives a
                        good insight for global book translation business. In other words, when
                        publishers translate Anglo-American books into East Asian languages, they
                        may have to consider changing their book covers to have brighter and less
                        colorful images. The opposite suggestion should be made for the other
                        direction of translation, for example, translation of Chinese or Japanese
                        books into English. 

                

                
                    Possibility of combining book selection process and media
                        visualization

                    34
Since book cover images have been proven to be an important element in
                        readers’ book selection, it is natural to devise visualization tools for the
                        book selection process. For example, Thudt, Hinrichs and Carpendale (2012)
                        developed an interactive visualization system to allow serendipitous book
                        discoveries by providing cover images based on various metadata including
                        keywords, publication and content dates, length and author names [Thudt et al. 2012]. In their system, the cover color circle focuses
                        on this aesthetic quality of books by providing an overview of cover colors
                        as they occur in the book selection. With more refined and richer metadata
                        such as users’ preference and their searching or reading history, this kind
                        of approach can generate more sophisticated interactive book selection or
                        book recommendation systems. 

                

                
                    Potentials of media visualization in information science

                    35
Information science has a long and strong tradition of information
                        visualization such as bibliometrics and social network analysis. Media
                        visualization can enrich this tradition by enabling more cultural and
                        historical artifacts data to be analyzed with flexible graphical analysis
                        technique. Since media visualization allows direct display of images of
                        artifacts or still shots of video, with all the data displayed on a big
                        canvas (screen), it can reveal unknown patterns, which may not be visible if
                        we only use a small number of cases [Manovich et al. 2012]. The
                        patterns can be identified by time, by geographical locations or other
                        variables. Numerous digital collections of cultural heritage have been
                        developed and available worldwide in the past several decades. Media
                        visualization tools can make a significant contribution in research on those
                        collections via easy-to-use analysis techniques. 

                

                
                    Study limitation and future research direction

                    36
Unlike Manovich and his colleagues’ massive study with 1 million manga pages
                            [Manovich et al. 2012], this study used only 100 images per each
                        country. It would be more desirable if a much larger data set is used.
                        Including more countries would be better as well, particularly if cultural
                        differences are pursued. Even if changing cover images when translated into
                        other languages or countries is common, in many cases the original cover
                        images are used in multiple countries. It would be interesting to see how
                        much the result may differ, if only unique cover images are included.
                        However, if time is considered as a variable, it is also necessary to
                        consider the fact that even in the same country a book may change its cover
                        images numerous times for marketing purposes. 

                    37
As mentioned before, some cover images have their white borders but the
                        borders were not removed due to time limits for this manuscript. The white
                        borders and “Look Inside!” icons may influence the
                        measurement of brightness, hue or saturation values of each image, although
                        the overall impact on the final data analysis is thought to be minimal,
                        considering the fact that only median values are included in the analysis. 

                    38
Expansion of this study into other image collections is natural. For example,
                        jacket images of music CD or DVD collections can be easily analyzed by the
                        same technique used in this study. The analysis can be conducted in multiple
                        ways including by time or location. 

                

            

            
                Conclusion

                39
In their qualitative content analysis with 69 finalist titles for the 2010
                    Governor General’s Literary Awards, Pecoskie and Desrochers (2013) suggested
                    that peritextual information, including items on book covers, can provide great
                    values to the areas of readers’ advisory and research [Pecoskie & Desrochers 2013]. Media visualization may reveal valuable patterns
                    and findings, often hidden, for further understanding of peritextual
                    information’s role in reading experiences and marketing. It is believed that
                    this study makes a contribution by providing connection between research
                    interests in book cover images and media visualization technique for further
                    investigation. In practical application aspects, it also contributes in the book
                    business, particularly in the area of translation and marketing of books in
                    different countries with different cover images.
