F1 Lansdall Welfare T1 FindMyPast Newspaper Team Cristianini N1 Author information 1 <ORGANIZATION>Intelligent Systems Laboratory University of Bristol Bristol</ORGANIZATION> BS8 1UB United Kingdom Abstract We address the problem of observing periodic changes in the behaviour of a large population by analysing the daily contents of newspapers published in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> from 1836 to 1922 This is done by analysing the daily time series of the relative frequency of the 25K most frequent words for each country resulting in the study of 50K time series for 31 755 days Behaviours that are found to be strongly periodic include seasonal activities such as hunting and harvesting A strong connection with natural cycles is found with a pronounced presence of fruits vegetables flowers and game Periodicities dictated by religious or civil calendars are also detected and show a different wave form than those provoked by weather States that can be revealed include the presence of infectious disease with clear annual peaks for fever pneumonia and diarrhoea Overall 2 of the words are found to be strongly periodic and the period most frequently found is 365 days Comparisons between <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and between modern and historical news reveal how the fundamental cycles of life are shaped by the seasons but also how this effect has been reduced in modern times PMID 27824911 PMCID PMC5100883 DOI 10 1371 journal pone 0165736 Indexed for <ORGANIZATION>MEDLINE</ORGANIZATION> Free PMC Article

Kingdom</LOCATION> a a time series of a strongly periodic word Christmas and b a time series which is not periodic London Both time series in this example are shortened to the 10 years between 1890 and 1900 for illustrative purposes Discovering Periodic Patterns in Historical News PLoS One 2016 11 11 e0165736 image Fig 2 Fig 2 Periodicities of words in a the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus and b the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus with at least 20 of their variance explained by a single Fourier component Each circle represents a single word with its position around each figure indicating the peak time of usage the radius from the centre indicating the period between 30 days inner most and four years outer most while the size of the individual circles along with their colour indicates the variance explained with larger darker circles explaining more of their variance with a single Fourier component This shows the general methodology we developed for the detection of periodic words is capable of finding any periodicity between 30 days and 5 years with a rigorous statistical test Some words have indeed a 2 years cycle <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> political elections and some others have a shorter cycle fashion related words This makes more remarkable the finding that most of the periodic words have a 12 month cycle Similarly there seems to be a non uniform distribution in the phases with most words peaking in the summer months Discovering Periodic Patterns in Historical News PLoS One 2016 11 11 e0165736 image Fig 3 Fig 3Strongly periodic words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus with a seasonal component are shown categorised into one of 12 topical categories Each circle denotes a word in the corpus with the labels shown around the outside Label font size and circle size indicate the variance explained by the first component Position around the figure indicates the phase of the period corresponding to the day of the year where the word is most present Words are grouped by colour indicating their category Discovering Periodic Patterns in Historical News PLoS One 2016 11 11 e0165736 image Fig 4 Fig 4Strongly periodic words in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus with a seasonal component are shown categorised into one of 12 topical categories Each circle denotes a word in the corpus with the labels shown around the outside Label font size and circle size indicate the variance explained by the first component Position around the figure indicates the phase of the period corresponding to the day of the year where the word is most present Words are grouped by colour indicating their category Discovering Periodic Patterns in Historical News PLoS One 2016 11 11 e0165736 image Fig 5 Fig 5 Variance explained averaged over all seasonally periodic words and total number of seasonally periodic words peaking per day in a the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus and b the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus compared with the maximum daily temperature and photoperiod in each geographical region respectively Each series is standardized while the two former series were first smoothed using a 15 day centred moving average The grey area represents the 99 confidence interval for the Temperature series We can see that the average variance explained per day and the number of seasonal words peaking per day correlates more closely with the temperature rather than the photoperiod with most words peaking at the warmest and coldest time of the year This suggests that activities are driven by temperature rather than by day length Discovering Periodic

corpus a shows the most complex periodic waveform advent in the time domain while b shows the corresponding <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> spectrum where we can see several components are activated c shows the most sinusoidal periodic waveform lamb in the time domain with d showing the corresponding <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> spectrum where we can see that only one component is strongly activated
