nberkman_at_princeton_dot_edu gt <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION> Abstract The formally constrained work of the <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> l <PERSON>Ouvroir de Litt</PERSON> rature Potentielle loosely translated as <ORGANIZATION>Workshop of Potential Literature</ORGANIZATION> lends itself particularly well to digital studies which was quickly recognized by the members of the group To facilitate its goal of avoiding chance in its literary production the group was naturally drawn to the determinism of computers where true chance is simply impossible In its early years therefore the group used algorithmic procedures as a starting point for various texts and also attempted to program these texts on actual computers creating some of the first electronic literature and embarking on proto digital humanities work as early as the 1960s and 1970s later abandoning these efforts and relegating all subsequent activity to a subsidiary group To understand the <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> s forays into computer science and more importantly why they abandoned them I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of the <ORGANIZATION>Princeton Center for Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> The goal was twofold first through exploratory programming I intended to create interactive digital annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation more importantly I hoped that by attempting to reproduce the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> s own algorithmic efforts I would gain similar insights into the nature of Potential Literature and be able to understand why the group abandoned such efforts after the 1970s This article describes the content development and results of my project For each of my three Python based annexes I offer a historical survey of the Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the Oulipo s own proto digital humanities experiments then I will talk about my own experiences as a coder researcher what learning <PERSON>Python</PERSON> has brought to my project and how my exploratory programming offered me a new kind of critical reflection Establishing these annexes forced me to learn to code a type of work that does not only produce digital texts but also helped me to reflect on the notion of chance in a more nuanced way Finally coding has allowed me to better understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital experimentation Introduction 1 The Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle OuLiPo loosely translated into English as the Workshop for Potential Literature an experimental writing group founded in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in 1960 attempts to apply mathematical procedures to literature inventing procedures known as constraints to follow during the composition of a text One of the main goals of this strategy is to reduce the role of chance and it is therefore unsurprising that computers were one of the first items on its early agenda Computers are utterly incompatible with the notion of chance and in theory should have been a perfect and rather timely solution Indeed the founding of the <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> coincided with a critical stage in the development of computers and the group took full advantage thereof programming their texts and procedures through partnerships with <ORGANIZATION>Bull Computers</ORGANIZATION> and the Centre Pompidou Early computing put one in much closer contact with the basic fabric of coding and the members quickly learned that writing code requires one to divide a problem into its simplest logical components very much like the elementary procedures they were inventing in the group s formative years However by the 1970s the group abandoned such efforts relegating all future algorithmic experimentation to a subsidiary 2 In recent years the field of digital humanities has been gaining popularity While far from nascent the origins can be dated back to as early as the 1940s the discipline has failed to define itself often preferring a broad scope that situates its activity at the intersection of computing technology and humanities scholarship In theory this sort of vague definition could be seen as beneficial encompassing a wide range of tools and techniques that can be applied to humanistic work In practice while a great variety of scholarship has been and is currently being undertaken that claims to use digital humanities practices a majority of this work seems to fall under the categories of textual encoding the creation of digital archives and the use of ready made tools to run some type of analysis on a digital text or visualize data from it The fact that digital humanists do not seem to prioritize learning to program has been lamented on several occasions by <PERSON>Nick Montfort</PERSON> both in his own treatise on exploratory programming for humanistic inquiry Montfort 2016 and also in A <ORGANIZATION>New Companion to Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> Montfort 2015 While not widespread a knowledge of computing languages and algorithmic procedures can indeed be productive in humanistic research as the <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> demonstrates through its aforementioned computer efforts as well as through its non algorithmic productions which given the highly intentional compositional methods lend themselves well to computational methods of inquiry The Oulipo is not only a particularly good example of raw material to be analyzed using digital methods but is also present in many canonical digital humanities criticisms one of the best examples being <PERSON>Stephen Ramsay</PERSON> s Reading Machines Ramsay 2011 3 However the goal of this article is not to give a critical overview of the use of <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> studies for digital humanities It is rather to demonstrate how I was able to use exploratory programming to understand the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> s forays into computer science and more importantly why the group abandoned such initiatives To this end I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of the <ORGANIZATION>Princeton Center for Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> under the guidance of <ORGANIZATION>Cliff Wulfman</ORGANIZATION> 1 as my technical lead My project had two main goals first through exploratory programming I intended to create interactive digital annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation more importantly I hoped that by attempting to reproduce the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> s own algorithmic efforts I would gain similar insights into the nature of Potential Literature and be able to understand why the group abandoned such efforts My original intention was to create five digital annexes of which I only completed three that would constitute the final product 2 each one to accompany a chapter in my dissertation The purpose and development of these annexes were intertwined my preliminary research on the <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> s computer efforts enriched my own understanding of the task at hand by learning to program I was afforded a rare glimpse into the mindset of the early <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> finally by manipulating the finished product my reader would better understand the underlying mathematical principles at work in these texts 4 This article describes the content development and results of my project For each of my three Python based annexes I offer a historical survey of the Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> s own proto digital humanities experiments then I will talk about my own experiences as a coder researcher what learning <PERSON>Python</PERSON> has brought to my project and how my exploratory programming offered me a new kind of critical reflection Establishing these annexes forced me to learn to code a type of work that does not only produce digital texts but also helped me to reflect on the notion of chance in a more nuanced way Finally coding has allowed me to better understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital experimentation Carrying out a digital humanities project on the <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> itself a quasi academic research group that both analyzes and creates resulted in a hybrid experiment with multiple varied results and insights which helped me both understand the history and development of Oulipian aesthetics as well as understand their texts better While unconventional given the nature of digital humanities work today the results of my research demonstrate a productive use of programming as both a creative and analytic exercise that can undoubtedly prove fruitful in future digital humanities work Part I Combinatorial Poetry Cent mille milliards de po mes 5 Published in 1961 by Oulipian cofounder <PERSON>Raymond Queneau</PERSON> and followed by a critical essay by his fellow cofounder Fran ois <PERSON>Le Lionnais the Cent</PERSON> mille milliards de po mes A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems is generally considered to be the first Oulipian text and therefore serves as an illustration of the group s initial goals and influences one of the main ones being computer science 6 In the preface unconventionally called a mode d emploi or user s manual <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> explains how the text was written but discourages the reader by claiming that the volume is impossible to read it would take a very determined reader 190 258 751 years to read all the poems even devoting 24 hours a day 7 days a week CMMP 2 To produce his machine <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> wrote 10 base sonnets each of which is constrained by not only the rules of this famous fixed form 14 verses two quatrains and two tercets a fixed rhyme scheme the poetic meter of the French alexandrine etc but also by three additional rules <ORGANIZATION>CMMP</ORGANIZATION> 1 Each rhyme in any of the original sonnets must rhyme with the corresponding verse of any of the other sonnets <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> imposes the additional constraint that the rhymes should not be too banal rare or unique Each sonnet must have a theme and continuity however the sonnets produced by the system do not have that same charm Finally the grammatical structure had to permit the substitution of any individual verse with the corresponding verse from any of the other nine sonnets 7 With 10 sonnets of 14 lines each adhering to these three simple rules <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s system is capable of producing 1014 potential poems The use of the word potential is a double entendre potentiel in French is the adjectival form of the word puissance or exponential power 8 Before reaching the poems the reader is faced with an epigraph by Alan Turing Only a machine can read a sonnet written by another machine <ORGANIZATION>CMMP</ORGANIZATION> 3 This approximate translation comes from <ORGANIZATION>Turing</ORGANIZATION> s famous Times interview I do not see why it a computer should not enter any one of the fields normally covered by the human intellect and eventually compete on equal terms I do not think you can even draw the line about sonnets though the comparison is perhaps a little bit unfair because a sonnet written by a machine will be better appreciated by another machine Hodges 2012 420 9 Note the use of the passive voice in the original Turing citation <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> who understood English too well to make such a blatant translation error makes the machine the subject of his epigraph The reader of his volume he claims while ventriloquizing Turing is a computer The physical conception of the volume does indeed support this proposition rather than taking pleasure in reading an exponential number of sonnets most of which are an incoherent jumble of verses from prewritten sonnets devoid of a theme and written by no one the reader must manipulate the verses of <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s original poems cut into strips to produce a functional book machine hybrid The Oulipo quickly turned to actual machines to reimagine this foundational text literally programming a combinatorial poetry collection that already owed much to computers image Figure 1 Image depicting how the volume functions Source http openset nl blog wp content uploads 2012 08 Prevert jpg Oulipian Computer experiments 10 Before designing my own digital editions I needed to take into consideration what the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> had already attempted The Cent mille milliards de po mes in addition to being the first Oulipian text was also the one that had been most programmed by the group three times in fact in the 1960s 1970s and finally in 1999 4 Evaluating these attempts contextualizing them given the historical capabilities of computers at the time and understanding how the group perception of this programming challenge changed with each new attempt would not only enrich my dissertation but would also help me in designing my digital annex 11 After deciding at their second meeting to seek out computers to pursue various types of analytic work the founding members of the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> came into contact with <PERSON>Dmitri Starynkevitch</PERSON> a French born Russian immigrant who was working for <ORGANIZATION>Bull Computers</ORGANIZATION> at the time He began Oulipian computer work on the CAB 500 computer that operated with the <ORGANIZATION>PAF</ORGANIZATION> language <ORGANIZATION>Programmation Automatique des Formules Starynkevitch</ORGANIZATION> article 26 Collaboration with <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> brought the <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> into direct contact with computing but also enabled <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> to apply the highly mathematical programming language to creative endeavors allowing both sides to gain insight into the potential of this new technology image Figure 2 Image of a CAB 500 computer Source http www histoireinform com Histoire infos2 CAB_500 jpg 12 In August 1961 Starynkevitch sent <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> excerpts from the Cent mille milliards de po mes produced on the computer The reaction of the Oulipians was less enthusiastic than might have been expected We would like M Starynkevitch to detail the method he used we hope that the choice of the verses was not left to chance <PERSON>Bens</PERSON> 2005 79 5 This response is key to understanding Oulipian aesthetics and what the early group wanted to gain from this computer experiment While there is a certain amount of chance in the production of the poems this chance lies entirely with the reader who is autonomous in producing what he or she wishes to read While <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s epigraph indicates that the reader is a sort of machine <ORGANIZATION>Starynkevitch</ORGANIZATION> s literal machine is too random for the group s aesthetics 13 After their collaboration with <ORGANIZATION>Starynkevitch the Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> had one final group effort in the 1970s a project known as the Atelier de Recherches et Techniques Avanc es A R T A at the <LOCATION>Centre Pompidou</LOCATION> which <PERSON>Paul Fournel</PERSON> detailed first in a conference entitled crivain ordinateur in June 1977 and subsequently in the Atlas de Litt rature Potentielle of 1981 Directed by <PERSON>Paul Braffort</PERSON> a computer scientist and member of the second generation of Oulipians coopted after the group s founding the goal of this project was to create a foundation for a possible agreement between computer science and literary creation Oulipo Atlas 298 6 They worked primarily with preexisting texts that were already combinatorial or algorithmic in nature Their intent was to demonstrate that with such texts computers can assist in the reading process 14 The first experimental text was <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s Cent mille milliards de po mes of which <PERSON>Fournel</PERSON> admits The printed collection is very nicely conceived but the manipulation of the strips on which each verse is printed is sometimes delicate Oulipo Atlas 299 7 The physical design of the collection is visually compelling and provides a more intuitive understanding of the combinatorics that regulate the volume However certain manipulations of the set of poems are cumbersome for instance reading <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s original ten sonnets In order for the computer to facilitate the reading process the A R T A program makes a selection from <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s original ten sonnets based on the length of the reader s name and the time it takes the reader to type it This generates a magic number of fourteen digits each of which determines from which of the original ten sonnets the corresponding verse is taken Oulipo Atlas 299 15 This method responds to the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> s earlier question about <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> s program regarding the method of choosing the verses However this new program is still surprisingly restrictive <PERSON>Mark Wolff</PERSON> acknowledges that this program has more potential in the Oulipian sense than the one produced with the help of Starynkevitch Such a program has no potential in the Oulipian sense because random numbers produce aleatory effects The original algorithm preserves an active role for the user even if that role requires the minimal engagement of typing one s name in order to sustain the creative process <PERSON>Wolff</PERSON> 2007 6 However with the physical edition the reader has the freedom to read in different ways This program on the other hand only produces a single poem using a method that is never explicitly stated While a reader could type his her name multiple times to produce new poetry to read this is a fundamentally less interesting task than manipulating the physical volume where the reader has more autonomy Herein lies one of the great difficulties that I would soon face in carrying out my project since the active selection of poems is what creates the illusion that the reader becomes the author having a computer replace the manipulation of verses deprives the reader of the pleasure and creativity he or she would experience with the physical volume My CMMP experiment 16 Given my understanding of the text and the Oulipo s multiple attempts to program it I began my project with the Cent mille milliards de po mes annex Its status as the first Oulipian text did not enter into this decision but rather I hoped that this text would be simple enough to serve as a practical introduction to programming in Python My goal of creating a digital edition of this text was not original In addition to the Oulipian editions I detailed above there are other excellent online editions 8 of the Cent mille milliards de po mes My aim was twofold first to use this text as a practical introduction to computer programming allowing me to better understand the Oulipo s struggle with this text and its computer legacy second to use the creative enterprise of designing new methods to produce pseudo random sonnets in order to grapple with the Oulipian notion of chance myself 17 To transform <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s work I first had to visualize the original 10 sonnets in computer science terms as an array of arrays In computer science an array is a type of data structure consisting of a collection of elements each identified by at least one index or key A sonnet by definition is already an array of fourteen verses that can each be attributed a numbered index In order to make <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s sonnets intelligible to a computer program I needed to rewrite them as an array of arrays ten sonnets of fourteen lines each Once I had this data structure I had to learn to write programs that would pick a single verse from one of the original sonnets building upon that to design a program that would generate a pseudo random sonnet from a 14 character key the digits of this key would each be between 0 and 9 indicating which of the original 10 sonnets to take the verse from Finally came the creative part I had to decide how to produce pseudo random sonnets in a way that would remain faithful to the Oulipian notion of chance In the end I came up with three different ways 9 Age The reader inputs his her birthday and the program uses the digits in the birthday to generate the key The calculations I subject the digits of the birthday to in order to produce the key are invisible to the reader and have nothing to do with the reader s age My next goal is therefore to tweak it to calculate exactly how old the reader is at the time the poem is generated so that every minute the reader generates a poem that poem is different from the previous Location The reader is directed to a website which gives him her a latitude and longitude value which he she then inputs into my program These numbers are then manipulated to create the 14 digit code to generate a sonnet In this way the reader can generate sonnets from not only his or her current location but any location The implications of this type of pseudo random poem are certainly in the spirit of the Oulipo but once again the actual calculations to which I subject the data to generate a 14 digit string seems too divorced from the method to be considered truly Oulipian UUID A UUID is generated from the user s computer which will produce a new sonnet each time given that the particular UUID that was enough characters and only digits is dependent on the time 18 Ultimately my annex is less than satisfying Not only does the reader of my edition still have no freedom but he she is not even allowed into the process The only person who had any fun in this is me That said perhaps programming this programmatic text is one viable way to read it <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> claims at the outset that his little poetry volume is utterly impossible to read in a human lifetime but also claims that only a computer can appreciate poems generated in this way Clearly to have any chance at reading the volume one must read it as a machine 19 Through programming I have gained a more thorough understanding of this text and its implications but I also understand how <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s choice of extremely specific subject matter for each of his original poems is the key factor in the hilarity of the potential poems Each verse of <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s original poems is essentially tagged with vocabulary linking it to its specific subject A verse from the first poem that is imbued with an Argentinian vocabulary for instance cannot possibly be interchanged with a verse about the leaning tower of <LOCATION>Pisa</LOCATION> without producing a destabilizing effect And while certain combinations of these verses may indeed be funnier than others or produce unexpected effects it is precisely the content of the original poems that is to say what would be invisible to a computer reading the text that produces the surrealist effect of reading the potential poems While my methods for generating pseudo random poetry given <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s originals may not be satisfying I can use my program to analyze the text further I have even adapted my program replacing <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s poems with Shakespearean sonnets that all have more or less the same theme The resulting combinations are far less jarring than <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s original precisely due to the lack of specific tagging vocabulary 20 In a similar vein this method can be adapted to interpret and analyze all combinatorial poetry Poetry as the <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> was well aware by its fixed forms and propensity for patterns can be inherently combinatorial The <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> was not the first in noting this property the Grands Rh toriqueurs for instance were writing similarly expandable poetry as early as the fifteenth century <PERSON>Jean Molinet</PERSON> s Sept rondeaux sur un rondeau Molinet 1999 is an excellent example Furthermore the <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> s work has inspired countless other examples of combinatorial poetry generators that can be adapted as I have and subjected to statistical analysis Computers can help a digital humanist when faced with a volume of combinatorial poetry of which the time to read exceeds a human lifetime allowing for a mathematical type of distant reading that is better equipped to explicate such computer inspired poetry Part II Arborescent Narratives Un conte votre fa on 21 <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s Un conte votre fa on A Tale in Your Own Way is one of the earliest examples of the choose your own adventure genre with the added distinction that it was also inspired by computers This text is inspired by the presentation of instructions destined for computers or rather programmed teaching This is an analogous structure to tree literature proposed by F <PERSON>Le Lionnais</PERSON> at the 79th meeting of the Oulipo CAVF 277 10 The importance of the tree structure here owes to mathematics and more specifically to the field of graph theory that was being developed at that time by fellow Oulipian <PERSON>Claude Berge Queneau</PERSON> s tale can incidentally be represented as a graph image Figure 3 Source http www infolipo org ambroise cours immediat images queneau_cavf pdf While the graph of this text can be represented in an infinite number of ways this particular one created by <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> is particularly aesthetic considering the choices he makes the nodes 1 2 3 4 9 and 21 frame the rest as these determine only expository elements but not the action of the story node 20 and not its double 21 both of which terminate the program seems to be <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s preferred ending judging from its place within the graph and not outside the story in short <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s artistic choices speak volumes about <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s own interpretation of his text 22 <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s story initially gives this reader a choice between the story of three little peas three big skinny beanpoles or three average mediocre bushes The choices are all binary and mostly stark oppositions For instance either the reader chooses to read the tale of the three peas or he or she does not Should the reader prefer not to read this first option he or she will find that the two alternatives offer meager results Refusing all three terminates the program almost immediately If the reader chooses the proper beginning and advances in the tale the first few choices of the story allow the reader to have a say in descriptive aspects of the story whether or not the peas dream what color gloves they wear as they sleep in their pod and whether or not they roll around on a highway first In many cases pointless alternatives are either offered to the reader in an effort to convince him or her of his or her autonomy the alternative descriptions or as unsatisfying dead ends the false beginnings Regardless of the path the reader takes there is only one real story There are even two choices that are not choices at all node 13 asks the reader if he or she wishes to know since when the one little pea has been analyzing dreams but the alternative takes the reader to the same node since the answer will not be provided in any case CAVF 279 The following node similarly promises the analysis of the dream but the alternative proposition affirms that If not go to 15 anyway because you won t see anything CAVF 279 11 23 In short this conte is not at all notre fa on The reader must read a certain subsection of the story as <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> wrote it and his her involvement is superficial While the story and its various itineraries can be visualized as a flow chart the text leaves very little freedom to the reader What I have identified as potential glitches could alternatively describe the true nature of this programmatic text The reader is a computer who once committed to participation in this program has no real freedom The true pleasure comes from the realization that the system while possible to program on a computer is fundamentally incompatible with such a design The illusion of freedom is the defining feature of the text problematizing the nature of the genre itself <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> computer experiments 24 <ORGANIZATION>Starynkevitch</ORGANIZATION> never had the opportunity to program Un conte votre fa on as he worked with the <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo</ORGANIZATION> several years before its genesis However through the A R T A project at <LOCATION>Pompidou</LOCATION> the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> produced a computer program of <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s flowchart text programmed in APL A Programming Language by <PERSON>Dominique Bourguet</PERSON> The goal was simple take a text that was designed with computers in mind and literally put it on a computer in order to facilitate reading <PERSON>Bourguet</PERSON> s program functioned as follows First the computer dialogues with the reader by proposing the different choices then edits and cleans up the chosen text without the questions The pleasure of playing and the pleasure of reading are therefore combined Oulipo Atlas 299 12 25 The computer is reductive in terms of reader interaction While <PERSON>Paul Braffort</PERSON> published one such conte produced using this machine in an essay entitled Prose et Combinatoire Oulipo Atlas 306 318 he conveniently selects the option allowing the peas to dream and the machine has carefully edited out any confusion Unfortunately their original program is no longer available but I would have liked to see how <PERSON>Bourguet</PERSON> chose to clean up the discrepancies in the text itself once the reader s tale is produced Indeed the genius of <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s text lies in the simultaneous display of all possible paths which can then be represented graphically Should the reader read linearly rather than follow the proposed algorithm he would note the contradictory nature of much of the short tale By allowing the reader to see only one step at a time the mechanics of the system are masked and the reader remains unaware of the mathematical potential of the whole story <ORGANIZATION>My Program</ORGANIZATION> 26 At this point in the project the Cent mille milliards de po mes annex had taught me some programming basics but <PERSON>Cliff</PERSON> suggested that I try to find a way to become better initiated with programming I worked independently through Learn Python the Hard Way 13 a free online practical introduction to autonomous programming that I highly recommend Beginning with basic information about how to use the terminal followed by a practical introduction to programming the lessons gradually built upon one another to allow the reader to undertake his her own projects by the end of the book 27 At the end of the program the author had an example where the user could make a program that allowed a reader to move through a Map with a pre established number of scenes For my first semi autonomous programming I adapted that program to make my own interactive edition of Un conte votre fa on Aside from a few basic errors in indentations and spacing my program was functional if not particularly elegant allowing a reader to read through this interactive edition of the text making choices about which path to follow As far as the reading experience was concerned however the program was unsatisfying My goal was to add the graphical representation and have it interact with the program somehow 28 Cliff introduced me to graphviz an open source graph network visualization project that is freely available for Python Given my background in mathematics and my research on graph theory I felt immediately at ease with the way this program operates In graph theory a graph is defined as a plot of nodes and edges In graphviz as well in order to make a graph I had to define all requisite nodes and edges The program then generates a visualization of the graph that is spatially efficient As an exercise I made a graph of the famous graph theory problem of the Bridges of K nigsberg 14 29 With this graph theoretical program in my Python arsenal I was able to make my own graph of Un conte votre fa on 15 Still not enough I aimed to integrate the two programs and <PERSON>Cliff</PERSON> and I decided to give my original program the structure of a graph so that it would be able to generate a graph with graphviz at the end My program now has nodes and edges that correspond with <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s prompts and choices With this structure I was able to write a program that enters the graph at the first node and depending on the choice of the user proceeds through the story printing out the selected nodes and the corresponding edges The program records the path the reader takes and at the end prints out a graph with the reader s path filled in green to represent the little peas While my little program does not take into account the full potential of the intersection of graph theory and literature as proposed by <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s text I am very pleased with how it functions For instance I can leave to the reader the mathematical exercise of finding the minimum number of read throughs required to hit every node While there is still more that can be done the graph my program generates is itself informative side by side with the text the reader can learn more about the potential of this three little peas story 30 Unlike <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s original graph mine does not depend on my own aesthetic preferences or interpretation of the text The vertical layout determined by graphviz s spatial constraints seems to have without any knowledge of the content of the nodes understood something fundamental about the structure of <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s tale This representation of the graph clearly demonstrates that there is only one true story with a few minor diversions that do not change the final outcome The left hand side of the graph nodes 2 3 and so on demonstrates a refusal to read the primary tale 31 This is an odd almost disconcerting outcome of my project that seems to confirm many criticisms of digital humanities scholarship If reading the text is unnecessary to its interpretation then is this not an abject refusal of traditional humanities work I would argue that this method does not necessarily supersede a traditional close reading but rather provides a legible visualization of the potential of similar graph theoretical texts Any choose your own adventure story is composed of nodes and edges which can be programmed as I have done using graphviz Indeed my program can be adapted very easily to create an interactive edition and graph of any such story I would encourage digital humanists who wish to try their hand at exploratory programming to apply this method to more complex works of which a traditional close reading might be obscured by the number of nodes and edges image Figure 4 Part III Algorithmic Substitutions <PERSON>Jean Lescure</PERSON> s S 7 32 The S 7 method was invented by <PERSON>Jean Lescure</PERSON> and immediately gained popularity in the early <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> most likely due to its precise definition simplicity of execution and quick and often hilarious results Proposed on one of the first <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> meetings on 13 February 1961 it enjoys a privileged position as one of the group s first official constraints Lescure 2014 A simple algorithmic procedure the S 7 begins with a preexisting text locates all the nouns S stands for substantif or noun and replaces them with the noun that comes seven entries later in a dictionary of the author s choosing Early Oulipian publications such as the first collected volume La Litt rature Potentielle experimented with many different types of texts to get some sense of the results 33 <PERSON>Lescure</PERSON> s article detailing the method claims that since the S 7 operator is a purely mechanical function the results also depend upon the chosen text and dictionary used Oulipo La LiPo 139 While not immediately humorous on its own the S 7 owes its entire effect to the structure of the original text and the nature of the dictionary and it is therefore recognizable syntactic structures that become the most humorous when nouns have been swapped out with others that are alphabetically not too far away For instance here are some English language S 7 exercises produced by an online generator 16 In the bench Governor created the help and the economist And the economist was without forum and void and day was upon

These are funny precisely because the original texts are so recognizable The syntactic structure coupled with a few surprising substitutions in vocabulary derail the reading experience and help us understand that nothing is sacred not even great literary classics or the Bible 35 The Oulipo s further work on the S 7 dealt more with variations on the genre Mathematically speaking <PERSON>Le Lionnais</PERSON> pointed out that the S 7 is a more specific version of M n in which M represents any taggable part of speech and n represents any integer value <ORGANIZATION>Oulipo La LiPo</ORGANIZATION> 140 <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s La cimaise et la fraction is an excellent example of an M 7 in which adjectives nouns and verbs of <PERSON>La Fontaine</PERSON> s timeless fable La cigale et la fourmi are substituted accordingly <PERSON>Oulipo La LiPo</PERSON> 148 Homomorphisms came next fixing a specific facet of a preexisting structure and changing everything else For instance homosyntaxismes reproduce the syntactic structure of a work with a new vocabulary homovocalismes reproduce the same vowels but change all the consonants similarly homoconsonantismes freeze the consonants while changing the vowels Oulipo Atlas 159 161 Oulipo Computer Experiments 36 The <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> did experiment with some recognizable texts early on once again in the context of their collaboration with Starynkevitch In January 1963 <PERSON>Dmitri Starynkevitch</PERSON> was an invited guest at a meeting <PERSON>Lescure</PERSON> insisted that he make a program for producing S 7 s on the CAB 500 and <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> spoke of the difficulties that arise when programming S 7 given the lack of a dictionary For a human author applying the S 7 method is tedious For a computer of the 1960 s it was virtually impossible <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> explains such difficulties All the difficulty obviously comes from the amount of material you need that is to introduce into the machine It is currently possible for us to work with a few sonnets of pages of text That is what we did for the Cent mille milliards de po mes But if we need to perforate an entire dictionary which is the case of the S 7 that is currently impossible Bens 2005 188 17 37 Eventually they proposed to correct various issues by hand By the following meeting <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> had programmed the S 7 method and sent <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> examples of the program applied to the Exercices de style Genesis they found that God was particularly potential <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> and Hugo In addressing these questions <PERSON>Starynkevitch</PERSON> had to do a great deal of work by hand He first had to generate his own small dictionary of nouns which he chose at random according to his letter separate it into masculine and feminine nouns and then apply the procedure to both genders separately With issues of plural he had to make corrections by hand as well as with exceptions to the grammar rules he had taught to the machine 38 These early examples were never published and the S 7 computer experiments were never mentioned in any publications My suspicion is that they were displeased with the S 7 computer program for two main reasons despite the fact that the procedure itself is ostensibly purely algorithmic and easily applicable to literal computers First while early computing was able to produce S 7 s so much was done by hand that the <PERSON>Oulipo</PERSON> very quickly abandoned the idea of using computers to do S 7 s What is the point of automating a procedure if such an automation requires the creation and perforation of a noun dictionary that has no other purpose Additionally correcting gender discrepancies that the computer could not understand was likely just as time consuming as doing the entire thing by hand in the first place 39 While the A R T A project focused more on strictly combinatorial productions where there were a fixed number of elements that could be recombined as the user wished as in the case of Marcel B nabou s aphorisms Oulipo Atlas 311 there would eventually be an amusing computer program produced that functioned along the same lines as the S 7 In July 1981 a conversation between <PERSON>Paul Braffort</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacques Roubaud</PERSON> a mathematician and poet another member of the second generation of Oulipians saw the birth of the ALAMO Atelier de Litt rature Assist e par la Math matique et les Ordinateurs ALAMO exp rience One of the group s most successful programs consists of emptying <PERSON>Rimbaud</PERSON> s Le dormeur du val of its meaningful words nouns adjectives verbs and replacing them with common words from Baudelaire s lexical vocabulary ALAMO website As Le dormeur du val is one of the most famous French language poems and has a particularly recognizable syntactic structure even ordinary people who have been through the French school system would find a hybrid poem humorous My program 40 My last digital annex is much more modest in scope consisting only of an S 7 generator Since this is such a canonical Oulipian technique that is often mentioned but very rarely analyzed my hope was to provide the reader of my chapter 2 with a program to generate his her own S 7 s In this way when I claim that well known texts produce more comedic effects the reader can generate an S 7 of a well known text and a lesser known one in order to enrich my analysis with more examples I had also hoped that such a program might be able to provide multiple dictionaries so that the reader can experiment with the effect of different types of dictionaries on the procedure and resulting texts A final outcome was supposed to be the ability to subtract 7 from previously written S 7 s allowing the reader to confirm whether or not an Oulipian had faithfully produced an S 7 without cheating While my chapter 2 includes a diverse and varied selection of texts and procedures only some of which are substitution based such as the S 7 my annex would aim to provide one small interactive example of the type of potential literature the early <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> was examining 41 Since my other annexes dealt exclusively with original texts written in French <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s Cent mille milliards de po mes and Un conte votre fa on I programmed them using the original French texts though I could have easily provided a translated version Given that the S 7 is a procedure however and that my dissertation committee consists entirely of native English speakers I allowed myself to circumvent the difficulty of gendered nouns by designing my program in English rather than in French My next preliminary choice dealt with the texts I wanted to provide to the reader I chose a set of very canonical English writings The Declaration of Independence Genesis The Raven A Tale of Two Cities and Moby <PERSON>Dick</PERSON> My final step was to decide which excerpts of each text to include I decided on the most recognizable parts generally the incipits given what I explained above about the S 7 method 42 This annex provided an excellent excuse to acquaint myself with Natural Language Processing using the <ORGANIZATION>NLTK</ORGANIZATION> s textbook and programs https enaming com exclusive domain nltk com While I could easily tag the nouns in my chosen texts manually such laborious work would inevitably produce the same dissatisfaction as early Oulipian computer experiments with Starynkevitch Nevertheless my first step had to be to create dictionaries of nouns using nltk Theoretically what <PERSON>Cliff</PERSON> and I have envisioned allows the reader to produce dictionaries with specific vocabularies which makes for more interesting S 7 variants The first noun dictionary I produced came from an online edition of <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON> s complete works An S 7 of the Declaration of Independence that uses a dictionary of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> nouns to produce the substitutions will not only be amusing in terms of diction but will also serve an analytic purpose The S 7 can be best understood as a commentary on an original text rather than an original piece of constrained writing While applying this method to a pre existing text does indeed produce a new document immediately the larger implications of the method imply that any text is the S 7 of another In other words all literature is potential 43 Devising this program has forced me to consider the S 7 from a critical perspective rather than a purely inventorial one While I had initially included the S 7 as a basic example of an arithmetical Oulipian technique I now see it as a first attempt in a long line of Oulipian research on productive substitutions These valuable insights while not necessarily unique to digital humanities work were facilitated and brought to light as a direct result of this project The collaborative nature of the project is one reason discussions with <PERSON>Cliff Wulfman</PERSON> who is not only a literary scholar but also a computer programmer enabled both of us to understand this procedure simultaneously as inspired by early computers and algorithmic methods 44 Studying and implementing natural language processing with nltk allowed me to better understand the Oulipian mindset that spawned these early procedures elucidating the historical context of why the group ultimately abandoned these efforts The early Oulipo inspired by the potential of computer programming demonstrated an algorithmic approach to literature in the early constraints the members produced My programming experiences helped me to understand the essential difference between these types of algorithmic procedures and the work that the group eventually settled on following the members dissatisfied responses to the computer experiments of the 1960s and 1970s a clear preference for abstract mathematical thought patterns and structure rather than the procedural tendencies of applied mathematics 45 Finally the creativity required to carry out such a project brings a new freshness to my research and analysis that I hope will enable it to say something truly new and interesting about what appears to be a trivial superficial method meant to produce one off silly results While in this case my code is likely not adaptable for other digital humanities projects I do believe that future scholars can benefit from a greater understanding of nltk in order to learn more about other algorithmic production that coincided with the development of computational linguistics and early humanities computing in the 1960s and 1970s An understanding of nltk has the additional benefit of promoting a certain kind of Oulipian creativity in literary analysis allowing a digital humanities scholar to invent a code that can analyze texts completing this fascinating loop of research and invention Conclusions 46 While the official goal of this project had to be to produce a product the real product has been the important insights I have gained from the experience In a sense the product was a pretext in order to take the idea of the <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> and in a quasi Oulipian fashion think about formalizing it on computers From learning to program in Python even though Python is not the language early Oulipians used in their computer endeavors I have gained a greater understanding of early Oulipian techniques and why the Oulipo abandoned computer programming relatively quickly and relegated this sort of activity to the ALAMO I also have a greater appreciation for how exactly to use digital humanities tools to explore new avenues in these texts that were created with algorithmic procedures in mind 47 That said as with Oulipian computer texts that lost their interest when programmed onto a computer digital tools are best when properly understood and critically implemented at least with regards to Oulipian work Creating a computer program of <PERSON>Queneau</PERSON> s Un conte votre fa on alone is not necessarily a critical act as it tends to obscure the potential of the constraint from the user of the program However using a computer to find more substantial intersections between the graphical representation of Un conte votre fa on and the text itself is an Oulipian endeavor Being an Oulipian reader means playing a game set up by an Oulipian author and they re a clever bunch If you don t want to be trapped forever in the labyrinth they created then you need to think like they do For computer texts that means learning to think like a computer and understanding wherein lies the potential 48 Beyond the narrow use of digital humanities methods in <LOCATION>Oulipo</LOCATION> studies this experience has convinced me that the broad nature of the digital humanities and how the field defines itself is productive Indeed the nebulous nature of definitions of the digital humanities allows for a great variety in approaches and can foster creativity Especially for literary studies such creative approaches are perhaps most appropriate Notes 1 I am greatly indebted to <PERSON>Cliff Wulfman</PERSON> who is no longer at the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> but who was a staff member during my project His advice was invaluable his recommendations of beginner s Python courses were always useful his technical expertise was unmatched But most importantly I have gained immeasurable insights from our conversations surrounding the creation of these annexes which I will discuss in the remainder of this paper 2 I ultimately abandoned the idea of making an annex for my first chapter on Set Theory as none of the set theoretic constraints discussed in my chapter would have been particularly engaging on a computer Furthermore the main purpose of my first chapter was a historical analysis of the intellectual inheritance of the mathematical field of set theory and not close readings of Oulipian constraints Additionally in this paper I will not discuss my fifth annex which took the form of a Tinderbox hypertext based on the geometric representation of the table of contents of <PERSON>Italo Calvino</PERSON> s Le citt invisibili While productive in its own way this annex is fundamentally different from the other three given its creation using outside software and its purpose as a research and note taking tool rather than as an interactive digital edition of the text itself 3 Original French Seule une machine peut lire un sonnet crit par une autre machine 4 The 1999 computing initiative was less an experiment in exploratory programming than it was an editorial and commercial enterprise resulting in the sale of a CD ROM While the nature of the programmed texts in the CD ROM share certain commonalities with the previous experiments I will not include this in my analysis 5 Original French On souhaita que M Starynkevitch nous pr cise la m thode utilis e on esp ra que le choix des vers ne fut pas laiss au hasard 6 Original French un possible
