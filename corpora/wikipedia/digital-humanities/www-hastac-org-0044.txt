Changing the Way We Teach and Learn

HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory) is an interdisciplinary community of humanists, artists, social scientists, scientists, and technologists changing the way we teach and learn.  Our 16,000+ members from over 400+ affiliate organizations share ideas, news, tools, research, insights, pedagogy, methods, and projects--including Digital Humanities and other born-digital scholarship--and collaborate on various HASTAC initiatives.

Founded in 2002, HASTAC is reputed to be the world’s first and oldest academic social network with annual pageview counts approaching the half-million mark. HASTAC is governed by a dynamic, interdisciplinary Steering Committee. Go here to learn more about current leadership.

HASTAC’s leadership and administration is shared between hubs located at Arizona State University and the Graduate Center at the City University of New York. Learn more about HASTAC's leadership and administration here. 

HASTAC International Conferences

HASTAC is an active community of 16,000+ members who are engaging in critical conversation about how we teach and learn year round. While these discussions are occurring primarily online and within individual institutions of education during most of the year, each year, hundreds of scholars from the HASTAC community come together in one space for a conference. These conferences are truly incredible environments for collaboration, networking, and transformative change, hosted by affiliate organizations at locations around the globe.Visit HASTAC Conferences to learn more, and to find out how you can join us for the HASTAC 2019 Conference.

Initiatives

HASTAC initiatives are where much of the work of this community happens: Key initiatives like HASTAC Scholars, The Futures Initiative, and The University Worth Fighting For offer lightly organized spaces of collaboration and dialogue on creating meaningful transformations in how we teach and learn.  In many cases, these initiatives take the form of “groups”, allowing HASTAC members to join, collaborate, and contribute. To learn more about all the initiatives we are working on now, and see where our past initiatives have already taken us, please visit our Initiatives page.
