                <p>This case study describes my experience implementing a digital writing assignment
                    in a traditional undergraduate literature classroom at Fairfield University
                    while in a pedagogical partnership with <cite class="title italic">The Map of Early

                    opportunities can offer a way for faculty at small liberal arts colleges and
                    universities to increase digital literacy among their students. I suggest that
                    such assignments be framed with supporting undergraduate coursework. I then
                    offer a series of preparatory steps and suggestions on how to modify an existing
                    course in ways that meet student learning outcomes pertaining to digital
                    literacy.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="kelley-getting.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">When undergraduates add to an existing digital humanities project, do they
                    advance their own digital literacy? The answer to this question is not always
                    straightforward. The following case study offers advice, course design ideas,
                    and sample projects for faculty at small liberal arts colleges who are new to
                    digital humanities but who wish to participate in crowdsourcing. It provides an
                    overview of digital pedagogy (with special attention on early modern studies)
                    and its relationship to traditional English classroom instruction, arguing that
                    there is a growing need for digital literacy among undergraduates, and
                    encouraging existing opportunities to partner with doctoral and research
                    universities. I argue that these partnerships work best when crowdsourcing
                    participants engage in intentional reflection throughout the semester, produce
                    more than one multimodal text, and, for spatial humanities and digital mapping
                    projects, theorize mapmaking with secondary readings and activities. I present
                    my own experience at Fairfield University, where my students and I contributed
                    digital-born writing to an award-winning, peer-reviewed digital humanities
                    mapping project housed at the University of Victoria, <cite class="title italic">The

                <div class="counter"><a href="kelley-getting.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Opportunities within early modern studies to partner with digital projects
                    through collective annotation, transcription, and digital writing abound. <cite class="title italic">Early Modern Manuscripts Online</cite> (The Folger
                    Shakespeare Library) solicits manuscript transcriptions; <cite class="title italic">Shakespeare His Contemporaries </cite>(Martin Mueller, Northwestern
                    University) aims to collaboratively digitize and curate non-Shakespearean plays;
                    and <cite class="title italic">18th-Connect</cite> (Texas A&amp;M) helps scholars
                    prepare digital editions of eighteenth-century texts through collective
                    annotation. Such calls for collaboration have been called
                        “crowdsourcing,” which, for Rebecca Frost Davis, involves
                    far more than outsourcing menial tasks. For Davis, student participation in
                    crowdsourcing projects meets liberal arts learning outcomes by developing a
                        “habit of engagement with the (digital) humanities” which “may be the beginning of a pipeline that leads students
                            on to more sophisticated digital humanities research projects”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#davis2012">Davis 2012</a>]. By providing essential “skills and technology infrastructure,” such
                    as coding, artwork, media production, and data aggregation, the universities
                    that started digital projects have opened a gateway for the wider higher
                    education community to participate in digital humanities as collaborators and
                    creators rather than consumers [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#alexander2012">Alexander and Davis 2012</a>]. Given different
                    institutional priorities, to develop and sustain a digital humanities site on
                    the same production scale as <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> at small
                    colleges is generally cost-prohibitive. As Bryan Alexander and Rebecca Frost
                    Davis explain, digital humanities is a new, cross-departmental enterprise that “has largely been the creature of doctoral and research
                            universities (formerly Research-I under the Carnegie Classifications)
                            and several state campuses, at least on the high-profile production
                            end”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#alexander2012">Alexander and Davis 2012</a>, 368]. While small liberal arts colleges or comprehensive universities focus on
                    teaching excellence, they can lack a critical mass of interested faculty and
                    digital humanities centers or labs to experiment, collaborate, or actualize an
                    idea on the scale of doctoral and research universities. Kathleen Fitzpatrick
                    identifies this work as “making archives, tools, or new digital methods”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#fitzpatrick2012">Fitzpatrick 2012</a>, 13–14]. <cite class="title italic">MoEML’</cite>s invitation to collaborate solves
                    the small liberal arts college’s resource gap, a worthwhile achievement in and
                    of itself. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kelley-getting.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">However, individual instructors who participate must explain, integrate, and
                    justify adding a digital writing assignment to a traditional humanities course
                    so that the undergraduates whose labor benefits the partner institution maximize
                    their learning experience. Several preparatory steps taken on behalf of the
                    instructor strengthen the ability of students to learn from their work as
                    crowdsourcers. Instructors should significantly modify a traditional course, or
                    (ideally) design a new, standalone digital humanities course, such as a
                    practicum that emphasizes digital learning outcomes on the syllabus. A practicum
                    or series of new courses would allow her to think outside of the box of a
                    conventional fifteen-week semester since essays or transcriptions may require
                    more time for revision and the peer review process. Instructors could involve
                    more than one cohort of student-collaborators in sequential courses for the same
                    project. Finally, the course should foreground and reinforce digital literacy on
                    a smaller scale in related course activities and assignments, such as
                    opportunities to digitize objects, to engage in shorter digital writing tasks,
                    to understand, discuss, and reflect critically on the uniqueness of multimodal
                    writing, and–for spatial humanities projects such as <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>–to read through the theory and history of mapmaking.
                    Adjusting the course in these ways will promote student learning outcomes that
                    pertain to increasing digital literacy, which I determined should be one of
                    crowdsourcing’s priorities in the undergraduate classroom.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kelley-getting.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">First, it helps to modify or design a humanities course that supports both the
                    time and the resources students need to write, revise, and publish a
                    peer-reviewed research paper as well as to learn digital humanities skills. At
                    the undergraduate level, a ten-member field practicum would have been ideal,
                    since practica bridge the professional world, where faculty publish critique,
                    and the classroom, where students receive grades. Wheaton College
                    undergraduates, for example, contribute episodes to <cite class="title italic">The
                        History Engine</cite> (<a href="http://historyengine.richmond.edu/pages/" onclick="window.open('http://historyengine.richmond.edu/pages/'); return false" class="ref">http://historyengine.richmond.edu/pages/</a>) in a fascinating course
                    designed specifically for this work, “Junior Colloquium:
                        Historical Methods.” The practicum could be sequential (“Digital Humanities I” and “Digital
                        Humanities II”) to accommodate multiple revisions or false starts.
                    Alternately, the same course could run every term with fresh students, a model
                    wherein each cohort is responsible for revising their predecessors’ work after
                    peer review. In this model, students would remain in contact with one another,
                    but the first cohort would not be under obligation to contribute once they begin
                    new courses or graduate. Even if these contributions require more than fifteen
                    weeks, theorizing a student’s first draft as a partial, unfinished component of
                    a digital humanities project that an author might not experience beyond a single
                    term has unexpected benefits. A delayed pay-off presses an undergraduate to
                    reflect beyond instant gratification, individual terms, grades, and degrees, and
                    allows her to see collaborative intellectual labor in a long-term framework
                    wherein creating requires more investment than consuming. The critical research
                    skills she honed while sifting and organizing data on an unknown topic will, of
                    course, translate to the workplace and everyday world, as will her ability to
                    conceptualize technology as tool and object of study.</div>

                    coursework ideally would include an opportunity for students to experiment with
                    digital writing (blogs, tweets, wikis) and humanities data analysis on a smaller
                    scale. The following strategies will give students experience making digital
                    tools by exposing them to methodology, theory, and practice. Before theorizing a
                    digital map, a critique of print maps and map-making would have helped, since
                    many undergraduates have no experience analyzing something as quotidian as a
                    map. However, Jean E. Howard reminds us that in the early modern period “maps were often considered rare and precious objects,
                            and seeing a map could be an important and life-changing event”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#howard2016">Howard 2016</a>, A11]. Maps are also never neutral. <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s Agas
                    map privileges the center (St. Paul’s, as was typical), but why and how? Rhonda
                    Lemke Sanford’s introduction to early modern maps, “Conventions of Mapping: Centers, Peripheries, and Orientations,” in
                        <cite class="title italic">Maps and Memory in Early Modern England,</cite> is a
                    way to deepen student appreciation of maps as historically contingent ways of
                    knowing and representing space [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#sanford2002">Sanford 2002</a>, 4–11]. Students
                    could analyze or draw maps of their hometowns, and then question what they chose
                    to privilege, push to the margins, or exclude entirely before applying these
                    same question to the map of a foreign city. One of my colleagues, Sonya Huber,
                    invented a Google maps assignment (“Lyric Collaborative Map”)
                    with her creative writing students (<a href="https://sonyahuber.com/2015/03/30/essay-assignment-a-lyric-collaborative-map-of-campus/" onclick="window.open('https://sonyahuber.com/2015/03/30/essay-assignment-a-lyric-collaborative-map-of-campus/'); return false" class="ref">https://sonyahuber.com/2015/03/30/essay-assignment-a-lyric-collaborative-map-of-campus/</a>)
                    inspired by <cite class="title italic">MoEML;</cite> this too would give students a
                    chance to experiment with a local spatial mapping project. Once students realize
                    that different centers are possible, as Sanford argues, they will begin to think
                    critically about the representation of spaces more familiar to them. A map’s
                    view usually closes off certain features of the city (slums, poverty, smoke,
                    sewers) and directs the gaze elsewhere. Knowing this fact allows students to
                    apply the same principle to their own entries. Where are we directed to look in
                    our specific research, and what is closed off from view? Once they see any map
                    as a malleable text, they can move with more ease to the more abstract question
                    of the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> digital Agas map as another new kind
                    of text, and begin to question how its digital medium both creates and limits
                    forms of understanding. </div>

                    with preexisting digital infrastructures. One good example, from Kathryn
                    Crowther, currently at Georgia Perimeter College, asks students to work in
                    groups to choose a literary text and map it in any digital format. After she
                    gives a number of options (hypertext, annotated texts, Google map, text cloud)
                    Crowther reminds students “there should be an implicit argument” in their
                    projects: “the data you are mapping should give us new insight
                            into the text, or should provide us with a new way of looking at the
                            text that broadens our interpretation of it”

                    In my cohort (Fall 2014), six or seven faculty members supervised undergraduate
                    labor; as a community, we could have shared tools, resources, and classroom
                    experiences. However, there was not a way to contact one another. As it stands,
                    faculty contributors pioneer their work alone. Although <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s Research Guide covers an impressive range of concerns for
                    students and faculty, some pedagogical questions unique to faculty (Will we

                    this project?) puzzled me. This would also be a place to address questions of
                    rank and tenure, where, as Bethany Nowviskie observes, junior scholars in

                    what distinguishes ours? Undergraduates need to think through this question, but
                    it also pertains to tenure-track faculty with promotion and tenure criteria in
                    mind. The University of Nebraska’s Center for Digital Research in the Humanities
                    suggests that criteria for traditional print scholarship applies to digital
                    work, but that additional criteria exist: “Specifically, how does the digital component of the
                            humanities research contribute to its originality? What are the
                            implications in terms of audience, pedagogy, and the creation of
                            research tools?”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#cdrh2016">CDRH 2016</a>]. A new “culture of assessment” would acknowledge the

                    learn, only two of these spaces constituted gardens in the modern sense of the

                    London’s first public parks during the period. However, the very thought that an
                    aquaculture operation (Pike Garden) or bearbaiting arena (Bear Garden) might be
                    called a garden led to productive conversations among students. Once I had our

                    time to recover from false leads, while writing and revision of this caliber
                    requires time to ferment. In hindsight, I would have let the students try

                    university’s digital humanities project, I began to reexamine my pedagogical
                    assumptions. The course that I chose to implement this assignment was EN213:
                    Shakespeare I, an upper-division Shakespeare survey with an enrollment cap of
                    twenty-five. We met twice a week, and coursework centered on the eight comedies
                    and histories we read together. EN213 had three traditional learning objectives:
                    develop oral and written skills, learn to appreciate literature, and develop
                    creative capacities. Although I ask students to engage in performance-based
                    learning activities and then conclude the course when they stage 10-minute
                    scenes together, most of my pedagogical and assessment tools in the course are
                    traditional: a white paper essay, short-answer exam(s), and short lectures
                    followed by discussions. How would I create a learning objective that pertained
                    to a digital literacy, and how would that add or subtract from time spent on the
                    other three more traditional learning objectives? By asking these questions, I
                    was shifting the subject of investigation from digital humanities research to
                    pedagogy, which, for Brett D. Hirsch, is too often

                    approach technology with more caution, and some are simply technophobic. In
                        “Why Teach Digital Writing,” WIDE (Writing in
                    Digital Environments) identifies common forms of resistance to digital writing
                    in the composition classroom: writing online should only happen once students
                    master print-based writing in linear essays; computer specialists should teach
                    all technology-related tasks; liberal arts education “should not succumb to
                        vocational training;” and the technological resources needed to teach
                    digital writing are cost-prohibitive [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#wide2005">WIDE 2005</a>]. For WIDE,
                    faculty can resolve concerns and opposition to digital pedagogy with support
                    from faculty development, which means “truly cultivating an ecology of digital
                    writing through a commitment to regular training sessions, mentoring approaches,
                    sustained software, hardware, and other support.”</div>

                    literature has always been experiential. Since so much of our experience occurs
                    while immersed in digital culture, it makes sense that we adapt an attitude of
                    critical reflection on the digital world while producing digital-born writing.
                    As David Ciccoricco and Bill O’Steen observe, English pedagogy was defined
                    broadly as “engagement with contemporary contexts” as early as 1935 [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#ciccoricco2005">Ciccoricco and O'Steen 2005</a>]. The teacher’s main role in this model (from
                    1935) is “that of a facilitator for experiences and not merely a dispenser of
                        requisite content.” In <cite class="title italic">Professing and Pedagogy:
                        Learning the Teaching of English</cite> (2005), Shari Stenberg argues that
                    the professor is a “facilitator of student projects, a co-inquirer, a
                            learner”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#hirsch2012">Hirsch 2012</a>, 15]. Thus by asking students to co-author digital writing (or digital-born
                    writing) in a group project intended for publication on <cite class="title italic">MoEML,</cite> I would be continuing a new variation of an older model of
                    teaching. Ciccoricco and O’Steen go on to acknowledge that most all texts today
                    rely on digital writing technologies for their production. In their course, they
                    developed a learning objective to capture student understanding of the
                    uniqueness of “digital rhetoric” on the web. That is, a form
                    of self-contained nodes (writing without long paragraphs) and internal and
                    external hyperlinks that allow users to forge unique pathways of reading
                    content, as opposed to a traditional paper medium, “which is resolutely linear
                        and hierarchical in organization.” With time to reflect on how this form
                    of writing differed from print essays, students could expect to exit the course
                    with a more pronounced digital literacy skillset.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="kelley-getting.html#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Reflection on the process of producing digital work is crucial in a variety of
                    learning contexts. When Troy Hicks examines the process of creating digital
                    portfolios, for example, he notes that simply collecting and digitizing an
                    archive of artifacts is not enough. Students need to reflect with intentionality
                    on how technology is integrated with each artifact throughout their digital
                    work, and to have some sense of how readers may navigate the site through
                    multi-linear pathways. Digital literacy, for Hicks, “involves the ability to view, read, and interact with
                            new media texts as well as to compose, design, and author them”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#hicks2005">Hicks 2005</a>, 205]. Hicks wants student and teachers to see themselves as “web
                        writers” whose work appears in a “medium of constant change,”
                    while Ciccoricco and O’Steen coin the term “designwriters”
                    [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#hicks2005">Hicks 2005</a>, 205]
                    [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#ciccoricco2005">Ciccoricco and O'Steen 2005</a>]. The New London Group emphasizes
                        “multimodal design.” All of these terms address the fact
                    that we use images and graphical elements (type set, color, size) differently in
                    digital work. With digital writing, design pertains to the imagetext on the
                    screen, but also the overall layout of the (external/internal) hyperlinked
                    essay, digital portfolio, or website. WIDE also prefers the term
                        “multimodal,” since, “today writing means selecting among and scripting
                            multiple media, including photographs, charts, videos, images, audio,
                            diagrams, hyperlinks, and more”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#wide2005">WIDE 2005</a>]. The practice of linking might be the most essential tool to promote
                    student understanding of how digital writing differs from other forms of
                    classroom experience. As Ciccoricco and O’Steen note, “through the practice of
                        linking,” students learn more about “intertextuality” and become
                    able to see “their own texts as being woven into a broader network of texts,
                        and not just the network of texts contained by” their particular class
                    web project “but also – through the permeations of external links –
                            that of the World Wide Web itself”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#ciccoricco2005">Ciccoricco and O'Steen 2005</a>].</div>

                    ways too, since it required social participation: co-authoring material,
                    collaborative research methods, and the production of a hyperlinked essay that
                    connects with other writers across <cite class="title italic">MoEML </cite>and the
                    Internet. For the New London Group, educators should recall the purpose of
                    pedagogy, which is “a teaching and learning relationship that creates the
                            potential for building learning conditions leading to full and equitable
                            social participation”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#newlondongroup1996">The New London Group</a>, 60]. Ideally, students leave the classroom better equipped to be citizens of
                    the world, and to express themselves in both “page-bound” and digital-born
                    formats. The New London Group suggests that the changing education environment
                    requires that we teach “multiliteracies,” a term that refers
                    to both “the multiplicity of communications channels and media,
                            and the increasing saliency of cultural and linguistic diversity”
                         [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#newlondongroup1996">The New London Group</a>, 63]. By researching “radical changes in working life,” rising global
                    citizenship and civic pluralism, and changes in private and public lives, the
                    New London Group makes the case for undergraduate curricular changes that
                    prepare students best for life after graduation. Considering the assignment’s
                    social dimension from the perspective of collaborative knowledge making and
                    global citizenship helps us put the new practice of crowdsourcing into a more
                    positive perspective.</div>

                    and stability as the most appealing part of the project. One senior felt that it
                    was “so interesting to have a final project that doesn’t end up in a file
                        somewhere or sitting in a box with all my other final papers. I like how
                        even after the class is over this project will continue to evolve and
                        expand.” Another wrote that it was “validating” that the assignment
                    went “beyond our professor’s desk” for the public to use. And it should be
                    undergraduates who remediate the early modern archive, what Bethany Nowviskie

                    students rightfully questioned how the project fit into existing course material
                    on Shakespeare. Only one of Shakespeare’s plays we read (<cite class="title italic">Richard III</cite>) explicitly mentions one of our topics – Ely Place
                    garden, where Richard sends the Bishop to retrieve strawberries. As a
                    consequence, at least one student wrote that in “a Shakespeare course,” her
                    work on <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>
                    “seems like historical outside fieldwork,” and she wished that the project
                        “was introduced more in relation to Shakespeare.” Such issues might be
                    avoided if our topics pertained directly to the theater, as many <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> projects do, or if I had designed a new course
                    as an interdisciplinary digital humanities practicum housed in the English
                    department. Some of the assignment’s challenges derived from the fact that we
                    were engaged in historiography while in a literature course. Unlike the
                    conventional argument-driven close readings of literary texts that my students
                    feel comfortable writing, the crowdsourcing project requires students to locate,
                    judge, and organize large amounts of data as forensic historians. The task is
                    complicated by the fact that the Agas map is a static snapshot of London during
                    a period of nonstop change and growth. Few sites remain consistent during the
                    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and some (including two of ours – Paris
                    Garden and Pike Garden) cannot be located definitively. Other sites we
                    researched began as concrete spaces, but ended as generic terms for altogether
                    different spaces, events, or activities. Often, we learned the
                        “cartographic evidence” did not concur with the recorded
                    configuration of buildings in archaeological evidence or historical documents
                        [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#mackinder2000">Mackinder and Blatherwick 2000</a>, 17]. In addition, my undergraduates
                    learned for the first time that historians disagree. While frustrating for
                    students, understanding sixteenth and seventeenth-century historical facts as
                    susceptible to strong debate eventually allowed them to grow as scholars.
                    Students who struggled (and they all did) with this realization found ways to
                    accommodate the unknown within their research. The map, tantalizingly friend and
                    foe, provided visual data that only applied to a very specific (pre-1570s) data
                    set in each entry.</div>

                    undergraduate research dilemmas. By the second week, I would recommend asking
                    each student to survey 2-3 existing <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> entries
                    and answer specific questions: how did the author(s) organize his or her data?
                    What data did they choose to include? What internal connections leap to the
                    surface? Is the entry readable, and where are its hyperlinks? I would ask
                    students to analyze the bibliography and share their results with classmates and
                    their own groups to develop target research questions. I would point to the
                    attempt by all contributors to write without bias or opinion, and I would stress
                    the need to stay within the allotted early modern time period even if momentous
                    events occur in the next century, as with the famous eighteenth-century theater
                    district, Covent Garden. Ironically, the research required in these encyclopedia
                    entries led students to regard the Internet with great skepticism: as one
                    student wrote, “I found it really difficult to trust anything we found
                        online,” while another stated “the internet is full of faulty
                        claims.” Sue Bennett, Karl Maton and Lisa Kervin’s study of the “snatch
                        and grab philosophy” predicts as much: “students’ everyday technology
                        practices,” including the instant gratification tied to social media and
                    most Internet searches, “may not be directly applicable to academic tasks”
                    that require critical thinking [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#bennet2008">Bennett et al. 2008</a>, 781]. But as a
                    result, students evolved as researchers to the point where they saw the need to
                    confirm whatever they wrote via more than one scholarly article. The project was
                    most successful in this area, as one spoke of gaining “a better understanding
                    and respect for what faculty researchers do.”</div>

                    became clear that our story as a contributing partner to this digital humanities
                    site was obvious: as city of London and its population grew in between 1550 and
                    1600 from 55,000 to 200,000 residents, the city lost fields, pastures, farms,
                    patches of wilderness, and gardens, many of which had been monastic land
                    dissolved by the crown during the Henrician Reformation [<a class="ref" href="kelley-getting.html#howard2016">Howard 2016</a>, A13].<a class="noteRef" href="kelley-getting.html#d76300e713">[6]</a> We knew that
                    urbanization reduced London’s green spaces, but we could not prove it until we

                    vegetable gardens (Covent Garden, Ely Place Garden, Paris Garden) had become the
                    ghosts of gardens, and open spaces were increasingly hard to find. As Norman G.
                    Brett-James writes, “whereas London was little more than the one square mile
                            in 1600, it had now grown in all directions and had swallowed up much of
                            the country in its immediate vicinity”

                    Brett-James reminds us that citizens of London could hunt and shoot game within

                    set by administrators), and rank and tenure committees, whose members evaluate
                    the worth of long-term investment in undergraduate research and judge the status
                    of print, digital, or new media publications for promotion. But the results of
                    these partnerships far outweigh the complications of bringing about such accord.
                    When undergraduates emerge from the classroom with confidence and experience
                    expressing themselves in a digital environment, we equip them with training
                    relevant to careers, civic engagement, and living their public and private lives
                    in a dynamic digital culture. </div>
