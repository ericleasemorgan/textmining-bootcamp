                <p> This study builds upon previous research that discusses gender and sexual
                    identities and digital narratives by introducing a queer narratological approach
                    to character creation mechanics. First, Lisa Nakamura’s identity tourism and
                    narratological constructs are applied to formalize the concept of the
                    exploration in digital narratives. Second, exploration of gender and sexual
                    identities is demonstrated through a queer narratological analysis of two
                    digital narratives, <cite class="title italic">Always Sometimes Monsters</cite>
                    (2014) and <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> (2016). Third, the
                    development of character creation mechanics in <cite class="title italic">The
                        Sims</cite> (2000-2016) series is examined to reflect the advancement
                    toward progressive game designs. Concerns regarding a sexuality blind approach
                    and the downplaying of homophobia are addressed, and Helene Cixous’s
                    poststructuralist “other bisexuality” as a
                    transgressive product of the fluidity of identities in digital narratives is
                    emphasized. This study elaborates the often-disregarded workings of queer
                    narratology and theory in digital narratives or game designs.</p>

                    digital narratives give their readers or players an extra degree of freedom to

                    criticism of major video game companies and their inclusion of
                    non-heteronormative practices reflect a resistance toward game designs that
                    challenge traditional gender roles and beliefs and attitudes toward sexual
                    orientations. This article examines the character creation designs of digital
                    narratives from a queer narratological perspective to propose that character
                    creation mechanics can situate the player in an environment where
                    heteronormativity is marginalized in favor of a poststructuralist understanding
                    of gender and sexuality, where players are given the freedom to explore their
                    gender and sexual identities.</div>

                    identities has been seen as the liberation from an essentialist sexed body [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#nguyen2003">Nguyen 2003</a>], evidence of inclusion by video game companies [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#condis2015">Condis 2015</a>] or even an instance of sexuality blindness [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#greer2013">Greer 2013</a>]. But the narrative techniques and narratological
                    ideologies that underpin the relationship between sexuality and digital
                    narratives have rarely been studied. To study how digital narratives allow for
                    the exploration of the player’s gender and sexual identities, what exploration
                    is in cyberspace is first established. This is achieved by a review of how
                    identity tourism as a cybercultural construct has been discussed and can be
                    adapted to an understanding of exploration. The requirements for exploration to
                    occur in digital narratives are explicated. Then, the character creation

                    with multiple, conflicting sexual identities through the emergent non-linearity
                    and parallelism of plot structures. Subsequently, in light of the recent “Gender Customization Options” update to <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#EA2014b">Electronic Arts 2014b</a>], the changes in attitudes toward gender as reflected by

                    and sexuality configurations produced by the designs of the digital narratives
                    are related to Hélène Cixous’s “other bisexuality” to
                    defend against claims of sexuality blindness or a downplaying of the experiences
                    of members of the queer community.</div>

                    synchronous interaction with other users and the virtual environment. Lisa

                    internet a chance to interact with new textual realities have been thoroughly
                    examined. Sherry Turkle’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#turkle1995">Turkle 1995</a>] book-long study and

                    and thoughts regarding gender and sexuality from interviews with users of MUDs.
                    The detailed qualitative data from both studies suggest that, having explored in
                    the virtual world of the MUD, users found their conceptions about themselves or
                    how sexuality works changed. </div>

                    where users can explore their identities is not being contested. However,
                    membership in the online MUD community has declined. On 9 September 2017, I
                    visited one of the major MUDs, <cite class="title italic">LambdaMOO</cite>, and found
                    that there was little activity — there were a total of 56 players, and only 7 of
                    which were marked as recently active. Research on digital media and sexual
                    experimentation and orientation need to now consider forms of more accessible
                    media. Both Turkle [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#turkle1995">Turkle 1995</a>] and McRae [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#mcrae1996">McRae 1996</a>] acknowledge that people who wish to enter an MUD need
                    some basic knowledge of coding or at least a willingness to learn it. That
                    digital narratives in the form of video games are much easier to install, engage
                    with and disseminate realize and amplify their exploratory function as a greater
                    gaming audience is reached. One of the key outcomes of the proliferation and
                    increased consumption of gaming content that encourages exploration is that the
                    needs of the traditional gamer demographic will be revised for the previously
                    marginalized gaming community. This will become even more evident as video game
                    companies begin to recognize that “even heterosexual, traditionally gendered gamers may
                            want to play with sexuality and gender in video games”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#shaw2009">Shaw 2009</a>, 239]. Further, unlike single-player video games, the sexual encounters on MUDs
                    occur between players, and without any other players online to interact with,
                    experimentation would not be possible — which becomes problematic given the
                    declining MUD community. One of the primary differences between MUDs and the
                    video games studied in this article is that MUDs are more reliant on other
                    players than the author-created environment to form a narrative. In the digital
                    narratives discussed here, interaction with other players in-game is either
                    optional or impossible. Experimentation with gender identities and sexuality in
                    video games is studied as a result of the interaction between the player and a
                    more pre-determined narrative structure and environment.</div>

                    intend to resolve the debate, but introduces yet another lens through which to
                    view video games — a queer narratological approach. Queer narratology was first
                    employed by Susan Lanser [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#lanser1995">Lanser 1995</a>] in her seminal article,
                        “Sexing the Narrative: Propriety, Desire, and the
                        Engendering of Narratology”, and responds to the lack of attention
                    given to sexuality and queer identities in the study of narrative. She reads
                    Jeanette Winterson’s novel, <cite class="title italic">Written on the Body</cite>,
                    and examines the omission of a protagonist’s sex and gender identity as a
                    narrative technique that prompts questions about the relationship between
                    narration and queer representations. The burgeoning discipline has been
                    gradually receiving more attention with Warhol and Lanser's edited collection
                        [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#warhol2015">Warhol 2015</a>], but it is still evident that more has to be
                    said about how narrative theory and representations of queerness are
                    inextricably related. Mia Consalvo’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#consalvo2003">Consalvo 2003</a>] landmark

                    conceptualization of exploration in a digital context comes from. She first used
                    it as a metaphor “to describe the activity of racial
                        identity appropriation, or ‘passing’ in cyberspace”. Terms such
                    as “passing” or “identity tourism” have been used predominantly in
                    discussions of racial identity, and in American history, passing is associated
                    with a “discourse of racial difference and especially with the
                            assumption of a fraudulent ‘white’ identity by an individual
                            culturally and legally defined as ‘Negro’ or black”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ginsberg1996">Ginsberg 1996</a>, 3]. Nakamura [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#nakamura2008">Nakamura 2008</a>, 1675] notes that identity
                    tourism is often performed by men who seek “netsex”
                    and can be a process by which “users
                            ‘wear’ racially stereotyped avatars without feeling
                        racist”. If we refer to this as racial identity tourism, gender and
                    sexual identity tourism is the act of wearing different avatars of varying
                    gender identities and sexualities. While racial identity tourism has been
                    understood in a negative light, Mimi Nguyen [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#nguyen2003">Nguyen 2003</a>, 288] has adapted the term to sexual identities to show its transgressive
                    capabilities. She argues that sexual identity tourism renders the digital space
                    into a “liberatory space, disrupting the social determinism
                        of the body from the identifications of the self”, where genders and
                    sexualities can be constructed and reconstructed by players at will through, for
                    example, character creation. Nguyen contributes to the already robust discussion
                    of how the digital space achieves poststructuralist philosophies of gender and
                    sexuality, but the exploratory element of identity tourism, ironically, has not
                    received much attention. In a study of users’ experiences on online MUDs,
                    Shannon McRae [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#mcrae1996">McRae 1996</a>, 249] notes that gender swapping in
                    virtual space can be “motivated by a sense of
                        self-exploration, to see what sex is like from a different point of
                        view”. Through this process, she continues, “we can experience for ourselves, inside ourselves, the
                            kinds of things that we associate with female or male, and realize that
                            those aspects are not, after all, something Other and outside of
                            us”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#mcrae1996">McRae 1996</a>, 253]. This act of exploring by “identity
                        touristing” with the possibility of discovering things previously
                    unknown about the self forms the understanding of exploration in this
                    article.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Nakamura’s metaphor of “wearing” an avatar is a
                    starting point for discussing how the exploration happens as a product of
                    identity tourism. However, I argue that the metaphor is insufficient to explain
                    exploration because exploration is an introspective process that requires
                    players to go beyond <em class="emph">wearing</em> other identities to <em class="emph">being</em>
                    other identities. There must be a temporary adoption of the digital body’s
                    identity (the digital body as the avatar or player-controlled character) by the
                    real body such that the experience of the digital body can be internalized by
                    the real body and thus modify players’ conceptions of themselves. Agency in a
                    digital narrative has been seen as what combines the real body and the digital
                    body on-screen. Katherine Hayles [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#hayles2008">Hayles 2008</a>, 17] offers a
                    description of this agency as the alternation between “top-down approach to narrative in which the narrator spins a story, and the
                        bottom-up model of interactivity in which the user chooses how the story
                        will be told”. This alternation forms what Dovey and Kennedy [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#dovey2006">Dovey 2006</a>, 109] would refer to as the “cybernetic loop”, that which makes it so that the “player and the game are inseparable for the duration of the
                        game” and transforms the real body of the player into a cyborg,
                        “a subjectivity that depends precisely on this collapse
                        of boundary between the human and the machine”. However, how it is
                    that players can adopt the <em class="emph">identity</em> of their character or avatar
                    must also be addressed.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">If a player is to experience a merge between the identities, then the player must
                        <em class="emph">believe</em> that such a merge can happen. Concepts such as
                    immersion, what Janet Murray [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#murray1998">Murray 1998</a>, 98] terms the
                        “sensation of being surrounded by a completely other
                        reality”, Roland Barthes’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#barthes1989">Barthes 1989</a>]
                    “the reality effect”, and realism in general are
                    related to whether this belief is possible. The crux of this issue is, however,
                    whether players can believe that they are an Italian plumber called Mario trying
                    to save Princess Peach of Mushroom Kingdom. Despite the sometimes large
                    physical, psychological, or mental differences between the real body and the
                    digital body, the player can comfortably negotiate these distances and assume
                    the identity of a digital persona. Katherine Angel Cross [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#angelcross2012">Angel Cross 2012</a>] has cited pretend play, role playing, and
                    imagination as processes that occur when someone takes on a digital identity,
                    but Peter J. Rabinowitz’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#rabinowitz1977">Rabinowitz 1977</a>, 126–134] analysis
                    of narratological audiences provides a more structural approach to this
                    phenomenon. Rabinowitz states that there are four audiences: (1) actual audience
                    — the flesh-and-blood person who reads; (2) authorial audience — the
                    hypothetical reader for whom the author writes; (3) narrative audience — the
                    audience that accepts the fictional world in which the story happens; and (4)
                    ideal narrative audience — the audience by which the narrator, not the author,
                    wishes to be read. Only when players are able to become the appropriate
                    narrative audience — those willing to accept a reality in which they are
                    occupants in a digital, fictional world for the duration of the narrative — can
                    their players adopt the identities of their digital bodies. When the digital
                    body or world is so incompatible with the norms of players that they cannot or
                    refuse to believe they can adopt the identity of their digital body, their role
                    is then more like that of a voyeur controlling and observing an on-screen
                    subject. Pretend play, role play or imagination are then processes by which
                    Rabinowitz’s narrative audience is adopted. Unless players come to change their
                    mind about their digital presence or world, exploration cannot occur because
                    then the distance between the player and their avatar or character becomes so
                    great that the player is not “being” or even
                        “wearing” any digital identity.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The ability to create a character in digital narratives cements the relationship
                    between the players and their digital bodies. Catherine Gallagher [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#gallagher2006">Gallagher 2006</a>, 351] makes some noteworthy observations about
                    the fictionality of characters in novels and the emotional attachment between
                    the character and the reader. Readers are attached to fictional characters not
                    in spite of their fictionality but precisely because of it — the fictional
                    setting establishes “a protected affective enclosure that
                        [encourages] risk-free emotional investment”. That the personality
                    exists only in the boundaries of the narrative without “extratextual baggage” means that the reader can be immersed in the
                    experience, identifying with and investing in only the presented individuals. A
                    character’s “peculiar affective force”, Gallagher
                    proposes, “is generated by the mutual implication of their unreal
                            knowability and their apparent depth, the link between their real
                            nonexistence and the reader’s experience of them as deeply and
                            impossibly familiar”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#gallagher2006">Gallagher 2006</a>, 356–357]. Gallagher is primarily referring to characters in novels, but the
                    players in creating their characters in digital narratives would seem to
                    strengthen their bonds toward them. First, by creating a character, one is
                    effectively responsible for its existence. In novels, according to Mieke Bal’s
                    character effect, the illusion of an identity is created. This identity is
                    conceivable only on the textual level as represented by the author. In digital
                    narratives, the character created is a product of both the agency of the player
                    and the author’s systems and rules so that the impenetrability of a character in
                    a novel is less applicable to a character in an electronic setting in which
                    players contribute to the presence of <em class="emph">their</em> on-screen personality.
                    The players personalize their characters in a way that renders them knowable
                    only to the players themselves, and the imaginary status of a character is no
                    longer imaginary because the players are able to identify parts of their
                    characters’ being as originating from themselves. This relationship between the
                    character and its creator helps situate the player within the narrative
                    audience, and the exploration of one’s identity can be seen as a capitalization
                    on the cyborgian inseparability of players and their creations.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"><cite class="title italic">Always Sometimes Monsters</cite> (henceforth <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite>) was released in May 2014 by Vagabond Dog and has
                    since received over 1,000 reviews on Steam, most of which were “very positive”, and awards for Best Writing and Best
                    Indie Game from the Canadian Videogame Awards in 2014 [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ValveCorporation2017a">Valve Corporation 2017a</a>]. The narrative starts with a brief
                    introductory sequence, after which there is a scene at a party where the player
                    selects the characters. Then, the game progresses one year in game time, and the
                    protagonist is shown to be living a life in squalor because of career issues
                    and, most importantly, because they broke up with their partner. The protagonist
                    receives an invitation to a wedding between this partner and someone else, and
                    the main conflict of the narrative and objective of the game is presented — the
                    protagonist must survive and pass through two cities to reach the wedding
                    ceremony to win their lover back with little funds to spare. Depending on the
                    players’ choices, and assuming that their character survives, they are either
                    successful or unsuccessful in stopping the wedding and getting back with their
                    partner.</div>

                    gender always corresponds to the assigned sex.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Research on the player’s freedom to choose an avatar’s sex or gender has
                    discussed this as some form of resistance against the privileged, straight white
                    male gamer, or as a step toward a liberal feminist philosophy. Nielsen [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#nielsen2015">Nielsen 2015</a>, 49] argues that in some RPGs when the
                    characters’ sex or sexuality “does not directly hinder
                        characters’ abilities in the game world”, the design of the game
                    conforms to a liberal feminist ideology. This understanding of sex and gender
                    presupposes that gender identities are stable. Perhaps this is because, in
                    scholarship on video games, character creation is seen as a gameplay element
                    that occupies typically the starting sequences of a game, and characters’ sex
                    and gender are understood as subsequently fixed throughout the rest of the game.
                    However, each playable character in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> is a tabula
                    rasa distinguishable only by the appearance of their avatar, and the choices the
                    player makes to modify this character throughout the narrative reminds us that
                    character creation or characterization is a continuous process. It was mentioned
                    that the expressed gender in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> corresponds to the
                    assigned sex; however, in the final sequence of the game, the wedding ceremony
                    scene, the protagonist is able to have a conversation with a transgender
                    character. This character asks the protagonist a question about their views on
                    gender identity, to which the protagonist may respond that they are transgender,
                    their lover is transgender, they “find it gross” or
                    they are “fine with it”. The answer to this question
                    does not affect the plot but can affect players’ conception of their
                    protagonist’s gender identity both retroactively and for every future
                    read-through of the narrative. The introduction of a transgender identity
                    distinguishes sex from gender identities and provides players with the
                    opportunity to explore the gender identities generated from a permutation of
                    assigned sexes and experienced genders in a digital narrative. Gender identities
                    and characterization in general in digital narratives should be recognized as
                    fluid and continuously shaped by the narrative and the decisions made by players
                    if the full potential of exploration and identity tourism is to be examined.</div>

                    and has garnered 360 reviews on Steam, with an overall rating of “very positive”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ValveCorporation2017b">Valve Corporation 2017b</a>]. Although it is an RPG, classifying it as a visual novel (not to be
                    confused with the graphic novel) would be more accurate. The visual novel
                    originated in Japan [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#cavallaro2010">Cavallaro 2010</a>] but the manga/anime art style
                    seen predominantly in this genre has been adapted by Western cultures, as in
                        <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite>; though there has been little
                    academic attention to this genre. Lebowitz and Klug [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#lebowitz2011">Lebowitz 2011</a>, 193] argue that “only a handful of visual novels
                        have been released outside the country”, but the genre is in fact
                    quickly gaining popularity outside of Japan. On Steam, there are over 700 games
                    with a “Visual Novel” tag [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ValveCorporation2017d">Valve Corporation 2017d</a>]. Lebowitz
                    and Klug [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#lebowitz2011">Lebowitz 2011</a>, 194] state that it is similar to the
                    choose-your-own-adventure style of narrative and that, most importantly, “they don’t face the length restrictions found in physical
                        books”. The large amount of branches and complex plots in visual
                    novels require large word counts that are more easily achievable with a digital
                    medium. In Marie-Laure Ryan’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ryan2009">Ryan 2009</a>] terms, the visual novel,
                    would be considered a “playable story” rather than a
                        “narrative game”, but the visual novel, as a
                    digital product, is composed of more complex non-linear plots, gameplay
                    functions and audio-visual elements. In the visual novel, the reader is told the
                    narrative predominantly through text and there are junctions in the narrative
                    where the player must decide which option to choose (see <a href="fung-playing.html#figure03">Figure 3</a>). The route and endings change according to the choices.

                    it is clear that there is a distinction between physical appearance and
                    expressed gender identity. This is executed more explicitly than it is in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite>, and the rare inclusion of the third-person
                    pronouns to refer to the protagonist in a digital narrative establishes the
                    equality of the multiple gender identities. Whereas from a feminist
                    narratological perspective, Ruth E. Page [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#page2006">Page 2006</a>, 29]
                    argues that “ambiguous characterization [challenges] the
                        reader’s notion of gender as a stable, defining feature of a character’s
                        identity”, in this case the reverse is true. The unambiguous
                    assignment of a character’s expressed identity, which may or may not differ from
                    their physical appearance, makes it explicit that a notion of stable binary
                    gender identities is incongruous with the design of this digital narrative. The
                    ability to mix and match sexed bodies and gender identities is what allows the
                    reader to explore how each combination elicits a different response toward their
                    own conception of gender identities. Further, upon closer inspection of <a href="fung-playing.html#figure05">Figure 4</a>, underneath the selection of pronouns, it
                    reads “You can change this mid-game if you like”.
                    While reading <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite>, the reader can open the
                    options menu to change what pronoun they would like their character to be
                    referred to. From a game design point of view, switching pronouns is not
                    difficult because of the text-based nature of the visual novel. However, the
                    effortlessness of changing the character’s expressed gender on the reader’s part
                    makes <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> the epitome of a digital narrative
                    that encourages exploration of gender identities. Even when the reader does not
                    wish to change pronouns, the knowledge that they can always do so throughout the
                    narrative continuously asks readers whether they are comfortable with the gender
                    identity they experience on-screen. Not answering this question is in itself a
                    response that reaffirms one’s current gender identity. It is from this
                    question-and-answer feedback loop that the exploration of gender identities can
                    occur.</div>

                    discussed as predominantly the result of readers’ ability to adopt an array of
                    gender identities. When gender identity is not fixed, however, sexual
                    orientation cannot be fixed as well. How character creation mechanics, in

                        Narrative”, as mentioned earlier, reads Jeanette Winterson’s <cite class="title italic">Written on the Body</cite> from a queer narratological
                    perspective. Lanser contends that the protagonist of the novel being unsexed and
                    ungendered produces two major outcomes. First, the reader cannot assign a gender
                    to the protagonist so that they are straight because the protagonist has
                    romantic experiences with both men and women, and thus the reader is always
                    confronted with queerness in the novel. Second, narrative tension from the
                    ambiguity of the protagonist’s sex and gender is created, and she uses as an
                    example of this a scene where the protagonist is in a fight with a male. While
                    an analysis of narrative tension would be interesting, in terms of examining the
                    exploration of sexual identities, understanding how the reader is confronted
                    with queerness is more helpful.</div>

                    of the character creation process to the end of the narrative. Whether readers
                    choose to create an identity that is queer or not does not matter, but the
                    design of the digital narrative and the resultant ability to play as queer
                    already situates the reader in an environment of fluid sexual identities. An
                    examination of the parallel/possible worlds and temporality of the digital
                    narrative can demonstrate this. Although to summarize her entire description of
                    these theories would take too long, Marie-Laure Ryan [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ryan2006">Ryan 2006</a>, 669] notes there are two major types of possible worlds, actual or
                    non-actual. She says, “In a story with multiple branches,
                        the world shown by the <em class="emph">current</em> branch is the only actual one;
                        the others are just nonactualized possibilities” (original italics).
                    In other words, the world created by the reader’s active involvement and shown
                    to the reader is the actual world. She further argues that “the branches not chosen become counterfactual and usually disappear from
                        the readers’ minds until they start all over again … and the branches passed
                        over no longer matter”. It could be argued that in a hypertext novel,
                    those as complicated as Shelley Jackson’s “Patchwork
                        Girl”, it is extremely cognitively taxing for the reader to keep
                    track of all the choices they could have made, but the branches passed over do,
                    in fact, matter and they can have an effect on the reader’s mind.</div>

                        time”, which is “established by the set of events taking place within
                            the represented gameworld”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#zagal2010">Zagal 2010</a>]. Second, Mieke Bal’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#bal1985">Bal 1985</a>, 39] understanding of a
                    duration of time in a narrative as “moments of
                        crisis”, moments when “in a brief instant of
                        time, the life of persons or an entire nation takes a decisive turn”.
                    Though the outcomes of each read-through may be different, each narrative is
                    grounded in the same crisis — winning your lover back in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> and undoing the curse from the cat café in <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> — and the gameworld time becomes bound to the crisis in
                    each read-through. If the lover in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> is getting
                    married to the protagonist’s rival in one read-through, and in another
                    read-through the lover is leaving the rival for the protagonist, because these
                    events take place in the same gameworld time and moment of crisis, the only
                    logical explanation is that these two events are occurring concurrently in two
                    separate possible worlds. Each digital narrative is then a sum of its parallel
                    worlds, all of which conflict with each other but are of equal validity. Thus,
                    even if a player attempts to select or create “nonqueer” avatars by
                    selecting, for example, a male protagonist and a female lover in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite>, these same avatars start off queer. The design of
                    the narrative necessitates that, at the same fictional time of the narrative,
                    the avatars are romantically engaged with avatars of different sexes and genders
                    in other universes. By default, each character must then possess every quality
                    within the limits of the digital narrative so that the player can choose which
                    one to experience in a particular read-through. The player is confronted with
                    the fact that, “[i]n virtual reality, mind and body, female and male,
                            gay and straight don’t seem to be such natural oppositions anymore, or
                            even natural categories to assign to people”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#mcrae1996">McRae 1996</a>, 249], and where multiple, fluid sexual identities are the norm becomes the
                    environment in which players explore.</div>

                    inhabit protagonists and love interests with heterosexual sexual identities
                    rests on two premises: first, that there is nothing in the narrative that can
                    confirm the heterosexuality of the protagonist;<a class="noteRef" href="fung-playing.html#d38254e805">[4]</a> and second, that protagonists can be
                    attracted to either sex, and particularly in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite>, a
                    transgender character. Without the narrative marker of sexuality that Lanser
                        [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#lanser1995">Lanser 1995</a>] describes, the multiple sexualities possible in
                    a single character should only exhibit queerness. There is, however, a
                    possibility that the queerness is not fully experienced. If digital narratives
                    might make people imagine “the concept of changing
                            bodies/identities/genders”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#angelcross2012">Angel Cross 2012</a>, 80], the structured polysemy that Katherine Sender [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#sender1999">Sender 1999</a>] describes, that the same message produces different meanings based on one’s
                    social background and beliefs, presents a possibility that straight people
                    imagine strictly straight worlds. To a part of the narrative audience who
                    refuses to accept that queer sexualities are in the narrative, the queer
                    characters in non-actualized worlds remain marginalized or do not exist because
                    the worlds in which queer characters play a role in the narrative are so
                    incongruous with the player’s norms. The power to explore gender and sexual
                    identities becomes hindered. Although this could be an issue in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite>, for <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> this
                    is not the case.</div>

                    wedding ceremony to get back with the lover, but, as with any novel, digital or
                    otherwise, the goal of <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> is to master the
                    narrative, to finish reading and to understand the whole story. While in a
                    hypertext novel, as Robert Selig [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#selig2000">Selig 2000</a>] notes with Stuart
                    Moulthrop’s “Victory Garden”, to go through every
                    combination of lexias is implausible, the mastery of the text is possible in the
                    more manageable narrative space of a visual novel. In <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite>, there are six major routes the reader can go through,
                    and in each one the protagonist romances one bachelor/bachelorette. However, one
                    of these bachelors, Graves, is unlocked only after all the routes with other
                    characters have been completed. It is in this route that the backstory of the
                    curse is revealed. Thus, if readers are to fully understand the story and master
                    the text, they must go through every route and, in doing so, their protagonist
                    must experience romances with both males and females. Although the reader may
                    choose the sexes and genders that retain the illusion of heterosexuality, some
                    of the characters, such as Graves and Mason (a bachelorette), are revealed as
                    having queer relationships in the past and when readers must be romantically
                    involved with these two characters, they are reminded that no complete reading
                    of <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> can avoid interaction with queer
                    identities. <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> allows readers to explore
                    sexuality in a digital environment where queerness is the only constant, forcing
                    its readers to either adopt queer identities or actively engage with the lives
                    of its queer characters.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">The ability to explore one’s gender and sexuality in these two digital narratives
                    has been shown to be primarily based on the ability for its players and readers
                    to choose both the protagonist and a love interest’s sex and/or gender. This
                    freedom opens up permutations of sexes, genders and sexualities that are
                    unavoidable because in every play-through, regardless of whether a
                    heteronormative configuration of characters is chosen, the temporally parallel
                    structure of all the possible actual and non-actual worlds forces the player to
                    experience the narrative in a game system in which all the player-controlled
                    protagonists in the narrative are of all possible genders and sexual
                    orientations. Each player is thus confronted with the knowledge that the gender
                    and sexual identities of their on-screen presence can never be fully stable. The
                    inclusion of queer characters other than the player-controlled ones in the game
                    environment further force players to engage with non-heteronormative identities
                    in order to progress through the narrative. It is not only indie digital
                    narratives such as <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> that employ this “queer worlds” approach to
                    narrative construction and game design. In the following section, progressive

                    sequel to its critically acclaimed and often-studied life-simulation series,
                        <cite class="title italic">The Sims</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#EA2000">Electronic Arts 2000</a>]. In 2014, the latest game in the series, <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#EA2014b">Electronic Arts 2014b</a>], was released and was named the most sold game in both
                    2014 and 2015 by the Entertainment Software Association [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ESA2015">Entertainment Software Association 2015</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#ESA2016">Entertainment Software Association 2016</a>]. For many reasons, it has been and still is mentioned
                    in many video game studies. The first game, which became popular soon after its
                    release, drew attention to the simulation genre in video games. Mia Consalvo in
                    2003 [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#consalvo2003">Consalvo 2003</a>, 181] called it “perhaps the most progressive game yet released concerning sexuality, making
                        it a good candidate for study”. Not many substantial changes
                    regarding sexuality were made to the series in the years following the first
                    game in the series, but with the newest update in the latest addition,
                    Electronic Arts may have reclaimed the title that Consalvo gave it over a decade
                    ago.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">In the first game of the series, Create-A-Sim (the name of the character creation
                    process in the game) is a simple matter of choosing between a few options. The
                    name, the age, the race, and the appearance of the Sim (the name of a character
                    or “person” in the game) can be decided by the player. The
                    Sim is either male or female. The player may allocate “points” to different
                    traits a Sim may have. A created Sim or group of Sims is always referred to as a
                    family; however, as Consalvo [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#consalvo2003">Consalvo 2003</a>] notes, the player is
                    reminded in the game manual, by its illustrations of heterosexual couples and by
                    its statement that only heterosexual couples may have children, that there are
                    certain restrictions to homosexual romance. Marriage is only allowed for
                    heterosexual couples, while sex or “playing in bed” is
                    permitted to both homosexual and heterosexual couples.<a class="noteRef" href="fung-playing.html#d38254e920">[5]</a> Any family of Sim adults can adopt a baby, and Sims may
                    receive a phone call when adoption is possible, though this happens randomly and
                    is out of the player’s control. From <cite class="title italic">The Sims 2</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#EA2004">Electronic Arts 2004</a>] onward, restrictions on homosexual Sims are lifted.
                    Marriage becomes an option for gay Sims, though it is called a “joined
                        union” until <cite class="title italic">The Sims 3</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#EA2009">Electronic Arts 2009</a>] where it is then referred to as marriage. Adopting a
                    child is possible from the second game in the series for Sims hetero-, homo- or
                    bisexual, and they can call adoption agencies directly to arrange this. In the
                    third installation, “family” is no longer used to describe a group of Sims
                    that live on the same lot but “household” is used. Character creation
                    mechanics remain largely unchanged except that each subsequent game allows for
                    more customization of, for example, hair styles, clothes and make up. The size
                    of a female Sim’s breasts is made modifiable in <cite class="title italic">The Sims
                        3</cite>.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">When the latest game in the series, <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4</cite>, was
                    first released, it had character creation options very similar to the previous
                    game. Electronic Arts in their marketing of the game emphasized that Sims now
                    had “emotions,” which are indicated to the player in terms
                    such as happy, flirty or depressed. On 2 June 2016, however, two years following
                    the initial release of the game, major changes to the customization of sex and
                    gender in the character creation system were introduced. Players now first
                    choose the Sim’s sex, which is either male or female. The following additional
                    four choices are given to the player when creating a Sim. <ul class="list"><li class="item">Physical frame:<div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Masculine</li><li class="item">Feminine</li></ul></div></li><li class="item">Clothing preference:<div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Masculine</li><li class="item">Feminine</li></ul></div></li><li class="item">Pregnancy:<div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">This Sim can become pregnant</li><li class="item">This Sim can impregnate</li><li class="item">Neither of the above</li></ul></div></li><li class="item">Toilet options:<div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">This Sim can use the toilet standing</li><li class="item">This Sim can only use the toilet sitting down</li></ul></div></li></ul> The physical frame of a Sim refers to aspects of their body, such as
                    their bone structure or muscle tone. Clothing preference is an option more for
                    convenience and decides what clothes are presented to players when selecting
                    their Sim’s attire, so that a Sim who prefers “feminine”
                    clothing will be shown those clothes and not “masculine”
                    clothing. <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> games previously only allowed
                        “masculine” clothes to be worn by male-sexed Sims and
                        “feminine” clothes for female-sexed Sims. Traditionally,
                    Sims of the female sex are the only ones who can be impregnated by having sex,
                    whereas those of the male sex, if they are abducted by aliens, can become
                    pregnant with alien offspring, which is not possible for female-sexed Sims.
                    Male-sexed Sims used to be the only ones who could impregnate. Pregnancy options
                    revamp this design and lift restrictions applied to the biological sexes. Toilet
                    options can be configured so that the animation of a Sim using the toilet
                    reflects the choice the player makes. After the initial Create-A-Sim sequence,
                    players may click on a wardrobe to change these aspects about their Sim again if
                    they wish to do so.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">While the masculine/feminine distinction used to describe the clothing in the
                    game can be seen as problematic, because it still presupposes an essentialist
                    configuration between clothing and sex, it could be argued that if no
                    distinction was made between “masculine/feminine” fashion, every time a
                    player clicks on clothing options, both types of clothes would appear, which
                    could lead to longer load times and confusion on the player’s part. Placing
                        “stereotypically” in front of terms could resolve this, but the new
                    options given to the player more than makes up for this little shortcoming.
                    Avoiding the oversimplistic conclusion that the game in offering the player such
                    freedoms is in some way liberatory, the character creation design can be first
                    approached from a feminist software design perspective. Feminist software
                    design, says Justine Cassell [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#cassell2000">Cassell 2000</a>, 304–305], adheres
                    to the following tenets: <ol class="list"><li class="item">Transfer design authority to the user</li><li class="item">Value subjective and experiental [<span class="foreign i">sic</span>] knowledge in the context of computer use</li><li class="item">Allow use by many different kinds of users in different
                            contexts</li><li class="item">Give the user a tool to express her voice and the truth of her
                            existence</li><li class="item">Encourage collaboration among users</li></ol> In the previous section on <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite>, the emphasis was on how players’
                    subjective and experiential knowledge of themselves and the truth of their
                    existence are uncovered when design authority is transferred to the user by
                    creating a character. In the later installations of the <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> series, Electronic Arts created collaborative platforms on
                    which a community of “Simmers” can be formed. For <cite class="title italic">The Sims 3</cite>, Electronic Arts [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#EAnd">Electronic Arts n.d.</a>]
                    created a site called “The Exchange” to encourage
                    players to share the Sims and buildings they had created in the game. <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4</cite> uses a “Gallery”
                    in-game where players can directly download others’ creations or upload their
                    own. In under a year of the game’s release, over 92 million Sims were created in
                        <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4 </cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#franklin2015">Franklin 2015</a>]. The many discussion forum sites both created by
                    Electronic Arts and fans of the game encourage collaboration among and the
                    participation of players. The addition of the new gender customization options
                    allows players to share created Sims whose identities are explicitly queer so
                    that the feminist game design in the previous games is now also a queer game
                    design in that it promotes the explicit expression of the experiences and
                    subjectivities of players of varying gender and sexual identities.</div>

                    that a Sim is always inherently bisexual because Sims are able to romance a Sim
                    of any sex or gender. However, referring back to Sender’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#sender1999">Sender 1999</a>] structured polysemy, players can imagine or perceive
                    a heteronormative gameworld very easily because the vast freedom given to
                    players in a <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> game makes the narrative produced
                    emergent. Tinsley Galyean [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#galyean1995">Galyean 1995</a>, 1] on emergent
                    narratives says, “We all construct narratives out of our
                        daily activities to help us remember, understand, categorize and share
                        experiences. … If any narrative structure (or story) emerges it is a product
                        of our interactions and goals as we navigate the experience”. In a
                        <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> game there are no prewritten narratives
                    like there are in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> or <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite>. There is no identifiable moment of crisis that can
                    corner the player into recognizing each subsequent play-through of the game as
                    part of a universe of parallel worlds. In this case, it is the sudden overhaul
                    of the game’s character creation mechanics that “queer” the game. It is the
                    fact that the most popular computer game of 2014 and 2015 has been updated to
                    include transgenderism and a greater range of queer options that demonstrates a
                    recognition of queer gamers by the video gaming industry. The trend in attitudes
                    towards sex and gender in the <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> series that
                    favors progressive and inclusive game designs forces its players to come to
                    terms with the fact that future games in the series will continue developing to
                    recognize queer identities.</div>

                    from the play style that the design of the game encourages. Consalvo [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#consalvo2003">Consalvo 2003</a>, 189] argues that in <cite class="title italic">The
                        Sims</cite>, “the player does not take on the
                            ‘identity’ of any one character in particular, but is expected to
                        create and manage multiple characters. … In <cite class="title italic">The
                            Sims</cite>, players can control any character they desire, by quickly
                        switching among them and by zooming into and out of different
                    houses”. Although in the newer games, the player often controls a few
                    Sims in a household, and although alternating between a few households is still
                    an option, <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4</cite> encourages a play style in
                    which players attach themselves emotionally to the Sims they create. Major
                    gaming channels on YouTube such as Pewdiepie [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#pewdiepie2014">Pewdiepie 2014</a>],
                    Jacksepticeye [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#Jacksepticeye2014">Jacksepticeye 2014</a>], and DanAndPhilGAMES [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#DanAndPhilGAMES2014">DanAndPhilGAMES 2014</a>] have produced “Let’s plays” of <cite class="title italic">The Sims 4</cite> where the video makers have created
                    versions of themselves to play within the game, which demonstrates the more
                    personal approach taken to gameplay as opposed to the “playing god” mode that Consalvo describes. The time and attention a
                    player gives to tweaking their character, which the detailed customization
                    options makes possible, and the goals players hope their Sims can achieve
                    encourage an emotional investment in their characters. The game marketed as that
                    which allows players to play with life lets players explore the world of the
                    Sims through the eyes of the Sims. Richard Walsh [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#walsh2011">Walsh 2011</a>]
                    contends that the <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> series as simulation and
                    thus representation does not offer a reliable portrayal of real human behavior,
                    which seems to repeat Plato’s dictum in <cite class="title italic">The
                        Republic</cite> of art and representation as at a third remove from
                    reality, but this does not impede the player’s ability to internalize on-screen
                    experiences because of the verisimilitude of the systems in the game. The
                    resemblance of the relationships between Sims and gender and sex systems in the
                    gameworld to the experiential world assists players in taking part as the
                    narrative audience of the game — an audience that accepts a reality where they
                    are occupants of this digital world. The result is that players can explore by
                    experimenting with the combinations of sex and gender and sexual identities of
                    the characters they have created and are attached to. It is the combined effects
                    of the encouraged play style and the ease of choosing from a multitude of queer
                    identities that foreground the <cite class="title italic">Sims 4</cite> as a digital

                    without any consequences “presumes an even playfield”
                    and reveals a sexuality blind approach that might “free
                        creators from the burden of attempting to create an extended range of

                    treatment of different sexualities as equal can cause the important issues on
                    this subject to be disregarded, and in a message board on Steam, some players
                    commented on the lack of homophobia in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> as

                    Sims to impregnate each other sparked criticism for being anatomically
                    inaccurate. It could even be said that changing a Sim’s sex, gender, or ability
                    to be pregnant mid-game with a click on the wardrobe is unrealistic and does not
                    adequately reflect the psychological and physical challenges a person faces when
                    undergoing operations to change their sex. However, it must be acknowledged that
                    issues relating to sex, gender identity and sexuality, particularly
                    transgenderism, are only beginning to be incorporated into games by major video
                    game companies.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Further, in response to allegations that some inclusive video game designs,
                    because of the conflation of varying sexualities, foster an environment in which
                    important issues regarding sexual identities are ignored, it should first be
                    noted that even the inclusion of queer options in video games was met with
                    uproar, as Megan Condis [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#condis2015">Condis 2015</a>] notes, from the “straight male gamer” demographic, thus placing issues
                    of gender and sexuality under the spotlight. The academic reportage of forum
                    threads started by conservative personalities such as Bastal and Duncaaaaaan has
                    revealed the on-going debate on these issues that have taken place simply
                    because game designers have so much as accommodated people outside the
                    privileged heteronormative demographic. In place of the
                    sexuality/gender/transgender-blind approach by some scholars toward the design
                    of video games that encourages an equal treatment of individuals, the emergent
                    transgressive poststructuralist ethos, the idea of “other
                        bisexuality”, should be considered as well. As described in her
                    seminal essay, “The Laugh of the Medusa”, Helénè
                    Cixous’s [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#cixous1976">Cixous 1976</a>, 884] other bisexuality is: <blockquote><p>each one’s location in self (<span class="foreign i">répérage en
                            soi</span>) of the presence — variously manifest and insistent
                        according to each person, male or female — of both sexes, non-exclusion
                        either of the difference of one sex, and, from this “self-permission,”
                        multiplication of the effects of the inscription of desire, over all parts
                        of my body and the other body.</p></blockquote> Cixous’s “The
                        Laugh of the Medusa” argued against Sigmund Freud’s “Medusa’s Head”, published in 1922. Whereas Freud saw
                    bisexuality as a merge of masculinity and femininity, Cixous’s “other bisexuality” resists these binaries. She imagines
                    a sexuality that destabilizes traditional dichotomies of male and female,
                    masculinity and femininity — phallogocentric dichotomies where femininity is
                    formed based on what masculinity is not. What results from other bisexuality is “a future when males and females explore the infinite
                            possibilities of their bisexuality, in this world of elsewhere,
                                ‘woman’ will no longer hold us captive, and the either/or of
                            essentialism will be worn out”
                         [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#binhammer1991">Binhammer 1991</a>, 77]. “Other bisexuality” describes desire as flowing infinitely and
                    everywhere, from anyone and to anyone, with no restrictions whatsoever.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Cixous’s essay was also famous for its coinage of <span class="foreign i">écriture
                        féminine</span>, or “feminine writing”, which according to her is
                    where other bisexuality can be experienced. However, the spirit of other
                    bisexuality appears in the discussed digital narratives as well. While it is
                    implicit that characters in <cite class="title italic">ASM</cite> or <cite class="title italic">Hustle Cat</cite> are sexed as male or female, and it is
                    explicit in the <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> series, these digital
                    narratives design characters as bodies of infinitely variable desires not
                    directed exclusively at any gender or sex, where essentialist configurations of
                    gender and sexual identities collapse. Especially in the queer parallel worlds
                    analysis, where a digital narrative is the culmination of playthroughs or
                    readthroughs with protagonists of all possible sexualities, the limitlessness of
                    experimentation with desire encapsulates the transgression of other bisexuality.
                    In such digital narratives, the progressive poststructuralist understanding
                    trumps the heteronormative categories of genders and sexualities and a
                    destabilized essentialism and unstable identities become the only stable
                    understanding of gender and sexuality. Considering the freedom to choose one’s
                    on-screen identity without consequence as embodying the spirit of other
                    bisexuality rather than being sexuality blind appreciates the transgressive
                    potential and power of the digital narrative. It also recognizes progression of
                    the designs of digital narratives in a direction that promotes the inclusion of
                    a previously marginalized gaming demographic. This is not to say that the
                    shortcomings that a sexuality blind approach uncovers should be ignored, but the
                    digital narrative as a platform where unrestrained, multidirectional libidinal
                    economies can be realized and can be experimented with should be considered as
                    well.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="fung-playing.html#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">As Jerry Kang [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#kang2000">Kang 2000</a>] notes, passing in real life is
                    significantly more difficult than doing so in a digital space — to pass racially
                    in real life, he says, for example, one might need to undergo expensive and
                    dangerous surgery. Digital environments allow for the separation between the
                    experienced self and the expressed self at the click of a button. Sherry Turkle
                        [<a class="ref" href="fung-playing.html#turkle1995">Turkle 1995</a>, 213] contends that when you choose to swap
                    genders virtually, “you may discover things about yourself
                        that you never knew before … [and] explore conflicts raised by one’s
                        biological gender”. The ability to play as different sexes and have
                    romantic attachments with either sex appeared as early as at the beginning of
                    the <cite class="title italic">Sims</cite> series in 2000. However, only recently
                    have digital narrative designs considered that the sex to which one is assigned
                    may differ from the gender identity that one experiences. Even though
                    hypersexualized sex icons continue to appear to cater to the straight male
                    community, as major digital entertainment companies become more aware of the
                    previously marginalized consumers of video games, characters with non-binary
                    gender identities, such as Krem in the widely popular video game, <cite class="title italic">Dragon Age: Inquisition</cite>
