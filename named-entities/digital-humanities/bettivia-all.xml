<PERSON>Rhiannon Stephanie Bettivia</PERSON> lt Rbettivi_at_illinois_dot_edu gt <ORGANIZATION>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign Elizabeth Stainforth</ORGANIZATION> lt e_dot_m_dot_stainforth_at_leeds_dot_ac_dot_uk gt <ORGANIZATION>University of Leeds Abstract Digital</ORGANIZATION> technologies offer opportunities for engagement with cultural heritage resources through the development of online platforms and databases However questions have been raised about whether this type of engagement is structurally open or bounded by pre existing institutional frameworks <PERSON>Michel Foucault</PERSON> s later work on governmentality speaks to this concern and identifies in modes of government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each to develop those elements constitutive of individuals lives in such a way that their development also fosters that of the strength of the state Foucault 1979 2000a This article takes <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> s insight as a point of departure for thinking about how digital technologies are mediating and structuring the relationships between individuals and organizations using the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> funded Europeana project as a case study Europeana is the embodiment of all and each as a technique of government it functions by fostering the contributions of individuals and national audiences in a way that celebrates their diversity while also engaging in a project to systematically standardize and unify Examination of the technical elements of Europeana reveals the political imperatives implicit in its technical operations and how the parameters for audience participation are subsequently defined In this article we examine the audiences explicitly and implicitly delimited by Europeana and then analyze them in relation to the project s development of the European Data Model EDM for the interchange of metadata about cultural heritage objects The article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about audiences what Europeana is and how its various parts work in concert constitute a definitional void This void is a technique of government in that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague It involves power relations that are hard to center and render visible and it is thus difficult to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege We suggest some tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to the sites of awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the technical framing of Europeana Introduction 1 The logic of participation and shared ownership frequently glossed as the democratization of knowledge belies much of the public discourse around digital heritage web technologies see e g Terras 2011 However the institutional imperatives that drive the development of such technologies have sometimes given cause for unease about the maintenance of autonomy for those using them Andrejevic 2007 Most often debates focus on how far the enabling aspects of online participation at the same time pose a threat to control over personal content how the ephemeral nature of digital content serves to further entrench the existing politics of dominant memory narratives or how the tensions play out between digital heritage in official memory institutions and community oriented or personal projects 2 <PERSON>Michel Foucault</PERSON> s later work on governmentality speaks to these concerns and also challenges the personal institutional dichotomy they presuppose He identifies in modes of government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each which seeks to develop those elements constitutive of individuals lives in such a way that their development also fosters that of the strength of the state Foucault 1979 2000a Here we investigate the move of all and each as it relates to the longstanding goal of European integration and efforts to confirm <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as a unified entity through the notion of a shared cultural heritage The Europeana project is the case study through which these issues will be examined further 3 Europeana is a database and website that offers access to digitized items from over 2500 of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> s museums libraries and archives Funded by the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission EC</ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> s <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> executive body Europeana demonstrates the move of all and each very clearly in its aim to promote a distinctly European space online for heterogeneous cultural objects and experiences It is precisely the involvement of individual users and organizations that furthers this aim the former group search for and submit content to it while the latter are the primary donors of cultural heritage metadata The parameters for user participation are subsequently defined according to these operations which potentially limits the nature of audiences relationships with it 4 Our interest here is in the way audience organization relations are represented and delimited by technology In this case study we examine how such relations present themselves within the socio technical network of Europeana and how audience conceptions operate as techniques of government on the part of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> We discuss the interplay between the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> s cultural policies and the techniques enacted through Europeana and show how the dynamic of all and each is manifested at different levels of the project Digital platforms like Europeana because of their scale their partial at best success adoption and their nebulous geographic location are an interesting site for further exploration of these issues 5 Our argument proceeds via an investigation of several technical elements of the project particularly the European Data Model EDM for aggregation and the application program interface API A conglomerate of existing metadata standards the EDM was designed to facilitate the aggregation of digital cultural heritage objects CHOs for the construction of the public memory portal found at europeana eu The technical premise of Europeana and its data model entail interoperability which have political implications when considered in light of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> s drive for greater social and political cohesion in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> However the political dimensions of interoperability are seldom if ever owned by developers The article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about audiences what Europeana is and how its various parts work in concert constitute a definitional void This void is a technique of government in that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague It involves power relations that are hard to center and render visible and it is thus difficult to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege We suggest some tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to the sites of awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the technical framing of Europeana All and Each 6 In the 1979 lecture Omnes et Singulatim Towards a Criticism of Political Reason <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> proposed that Western modes of government rely on the limited freedom of individuals for their continued functioning an idea that both parallels and challenges debates about cultural production and the public consumption of digital heritage Instead of stating the relationship between organizations and audiences in oppositional terms <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> identifies the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each He writes right from the start the state is both individualizing and totalitarian Its inevitable effects are both individualization and totalization Liberation can only come from attacking not just one of these two effects but political rationality s very roots Foucault 1979 2000a 325 While the reference to the state is somewhat misleading since for <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> the state has no essence and is a function of changes in the practice of government the suggestion that these totalizing and individualizing effects work to bolster one another is an important insight In a passage from <PERSON>Governmentality Foucault</PERSON> clarifies his theory further What government has to do with is not territory but rather a sort of complex composed of men and things The things in this sense with which government is to be concerned are in fact men but men in their relations their links their imbrication with those things <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> 2000b 208 209 7 These relational networks are composed of humans and things both technological and analog In fact in speaking about entities like the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> or Europeana we are employing simplistic terms to denote incredibly complex networks of persons and technologies as well as technological representations of analog things Law 1992 Technologies in the broad sense are understood by <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> as techniques of government such as programs apparatuses and calculations There is a growing recognition that processes and power structures are inflected in the way new technologies are being developed practices that are often specialized and opaque Lash 2007 Beer and Burrows 2013 Drucker 2013 Such in scriptions Akrich 1992 may or may not play out as designers intend when technologies are implemented and mismatches between design and actual use explain in part why some are successful and why others fail Understanding potential ethical and political issues requires greater knowledge of the way technologies are created how they work and how they are ultimately deployed This approach a socio technical analysis based on theories of governmentality informs our discussion of digital technologies in the cultural heritage context 8 Furthermore we suggest that the dynamic of all and each is particularly relevant to this context and offers a method of investigating more closely the negotiation of audience relationships and the individual institution dichotomy As <PERSON>Chiara de Cesari</PERSON> notes heritage scholars have been too focused on the centralization homogenization and cultural imperialism of heritage regimes and insufficiently attentive to the capacities of decentralized groups e g local communities or historically marginalized peoples <PERSON>De Cesari</PERSON> 2012 The all and each relation highlights the interplay of power relations at different scales <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> 2015 and is linked to another important aspect of government that it is not always successful in its regulative aims Its strategies are therefore diverse and undergoing constant revision <PERSON>Rosemary Coombe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lindsay M Weiss</PERSON> explain Government in short is a congenitally failing operation unanticipated outcomes emerge from the intersection of diverse technologies the conjunction of new techniques and old conditions enable things to work in new and different ways <PERSON>Coombe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> 2015 51 9 The technologies that have been developed within and through the Europeana project provide an opening for exploring how such failures are manifested in practice how they are adapted and re aligned with the aims of government and how these renegotiations require the enrollment of a variety of audiences Europeana and the <ORGANIZATION>Drive for Cultural Unity</ORGANIZATION> in Diversity 10 The story of the development of Europeana is bound up with the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> s ongoing commitment to fostering European unity emphasizing transnational rather than national institutions and affiliations Europeana 2011 The original impetus for the initiative came from a perceived threat to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> s economic interests after the announcement of the <ORGANIZATION>Google Books Project</ORGANIZATION> in 2005 Amid worries that companies like <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> would transfer a considerable volume of cultural heritage content into the private sector the proposal was made for an equivalent European program premised on open access and non exclusive rights Purday 2009 171 11 In 2008 the prototype Europeana database was launched the appellation making its transnational affiliations clear This was in line with <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> strategies since the 1980s to promote the formation of a cohesive European identity through its cultural programs Shore 2001 Formation is an important notion here because the aim of these strategies is to create something new built on existing histories and cultural heritage As <PERSON>Cris Shore</PERSON> observes in many respects what the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is doing is not dissimilar to that which nationalist elites achieved during the formation of European nation states in the nineteenth century i e mobilising symbols and inventing traditions in order to give flesh and credibility to a new political order Shore 2001 see also <PERSON>Hobsbawm</PERSON> and Ranger 2012 Yet difficulties stem from attributing European meanings to manuscripts and artworks that are associated with specific national historical narratives Likewise the very different circumstances from which the nation states of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> have developed present a challenge to the idea of a coherent European identity Cultural programs have attempted to overcome such disparities by inscribing diversity into the model for European integration and endorsing the idea of unity in diversity <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> 1996 Shore 2006 Such language connotes the move of all and each in that diverse local projects become mutually constitutive of larger governmental discourses <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> describes how the logic of modern political rationality can be understood as a permanent integration of individuals in a totality and vice versa a mode of governing that regulates individual conducts or rather requires individuals to self regulate conduct This is liberalism namely a constant correlation between an increasing individualization and the reinforcement of a totality Foucault 1979 2000a <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> 2000b 12 The motif of unity in diversity also echoes existing debates in heritage studies about the move from monocultural to multicultural forms Kirshenblatt Gimblett 2007 <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 2013 Narratives and representations of local and national heritage and the roles they play in the constitution of larger pan national projects are important as they manifest themselves in these relational structures One view is that the assimilation of peoples and nations into larger social and political entities is accompanied by the increased diversity of local traditions and practices <PERSON>Jamieson</PERSON> 2002 On this interpretation cultural difference is potentially reconcilable with the emergence of broader transnational entities The vision expressed by initiatives like Europeana that cultural diversity can be a part of European identity suggests a similar model but it is difficult to discern how it works in practice especially when such narratives are imported into the technical space Presner 2016 13 In the face of vast collections like those of Europeana a selective approach to representation is required to make the content serviceable The concern is that if the task of representing European culture in all its forms proves insurmountable then unity becomes a legitimating gloss for a discourse of European culture that is limited to a narrow construction of cultural heritage In this context the need to both define and safeguard European interests reflects the difference by which <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has historically distinguished itself from other territories Hall 2003 14 However the political uncertainty surrounding <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has resulted in a need for the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> to circumvent disputes that arise from talking about a unified European entity directly Anthropological research into the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> indicates that this is manifested at an organizational level as well Ab l s suggests that the underlying paradigm of the European political process is less one of unification than of harmonization and rationalization That is European political practice aims to influence national politics without spelling out its political goals he writes everything is working as if <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was destined to remain a virtual object Ab l s 2004 6 The concept of virtual <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> clarifies the way in which unity in diversity reproduces forms of identification and difference and reflects the indefinite geographical and governmental status of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 15 As we will go on to argue these relations continue to be replicated at various scales through the creation and implementation of cultural heritage technologies including Europeana There are also clear ways in which the policy trajectory of Europeana has changed during its lifespan which is consistent with flexibility as a practice of government Here we conduct an analysis of Europeana s conception of its audience over time as the project priorities shift in this way it is possible to understand Europeana s changing self conception and its relationship with European state and identity politics We take as material for analysis a series of papers produced by or at the behest of people involved in various aspects of Europeana with a particular focus on the API and the data model These materials represent different points in Europeana s development including 2008 The launch and trial of Europeana as an aggregator for metadata 2010 12 The development of both the API and the EDM 2013 15 Re launch of the website in response to claims of underuse and the introduction of the Europeana 1914 1918 project 16 Notions of audience both implicit and explicit at each of these stages reflect the adaptations Europeana makes in order to position itself as a successful digital cultural heritage platform although we acknowledge the difficulty entailed in defining success in this context With each new phase of development Europeana speaks to different audiences including cultural heritage institutions in member states and elsewhere internal and external technology developers individual content donors and the projected users who will search the platform to access digital representations of cultural heritage objects CHOs This latter group is represented by individual users within <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> yet given its partnerships with non European heritage institutions there is also the aspiration to reach a more global audience Decisions taken about technology primarily reflect the positioning of Europeana in relation to its users These different users and Europeana itself are both implicated in the European identity the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> promotes It is not insignificant that the structuring of the EDM also superficially reflects this idea of unity which we will discuss below 17 Despite pushing for a kind of unity Europeana is underpinned by disparate metadata and collections information This implies a political manoeuvre Europeana is on one level an absolute expression of unity in diversity it works as an aggregator of disparate data but only in cases where those terms are representative of standards and data models The vexed political question of how unity in diversity actually works is left to one side As discussed by Ab l s unity in diversity is a process of harmonization and rationalization and one that operates via a definitional void when Europeana fails to define its terms assumptions and dominant power relations risk becoming further entrenched Europeana and its Audiences 18 How does Europeana work and what is its emphasis This question is not trivial and it is telling that at a 2016 heritage studies conference the authors encountered far more people who had never heard of Europeana than people who could describe the project and its aims Answering the question requires an understanding of what the name Europeana encompasses For example <PERSON>Antoine Isaac</PERSON> et al speak about the multiple priorities and user groups of Europeana which belies the fact that it is not a single entity nor does it have a single sweepingly agreed upon identity for its users and creators <PERSON>Isaac Clayphan</PERSON> and Haslhofer 2012 38 Europeana is a complicated socio technical network comprising many components that change over time Here we recognize a few of them including the public facing web portal the API and the developers behind this and macro level policy makers who act as intermediaries between the various manifestations of the Europeana project and the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> 19 The public facing part of the project is represented by a web platform which offers access to digitized items from national museum library and archive collections across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> image Figure 1 The landing page of europeana eu 20 Its earliest iteration was modeled on the idea of a digital library However it is also a database that enables participating cultural heritage organizations to engage with a large volume of digital content primarily metadata about digital surrogates for CHOs Those involved in its development have shown an awareness of this public platform back end database duality To the general public Europeana is primarily perceived as a portal exposing a great amount of cultural heritage information Even though this perception is not entirely misleading the main goal of Europeana is rather to build an open services platform enabling users and cultural institutions to access and manage a large collection of surrogate objects representing digital and digitized content via an application program interface API <ORGANIZATION>Concordia Gradmann</ORGANIZATION> and Siebinga 2010 61 21 A more pointed quote that concludes the same paper demonstrates a measure of tension in how the greater Europeana project is defined Finally Europeana is much more than a portal even though offering portal functionality its main technical incarnation is the Application Programming Interface API on which the portal services will be built <ORGANIZATION>Concordia Gradmann</ORGANIZATION> and Siebinga 2010 66 22 As indicated Europeana has conceived of itself and its relationship with users in different ways over its lifespan and this is indicative of a number of tensions that have persisted within it What Europeana is or does is informed by some early key policy decisions chief among these the decision not to store any digital objects itself Rather Europeana holds metadata about digital objects from national collections In other words by using Europeana s search portal users are looking at aggregated metadata about digital surrogates for heritage objects for example an image file representing a painting and data about the museum to which it belongs its size and what the paint and backing media are etc Europeana does not save or hold these art objects or their digital images it simply collects data about them When users click through the content represented at europeana eu they are directed away from Europeana proper to the website of the particular institution that holds the analog object and that contributed the digital surrogate and its data to the Europeana database Example if you want to know more about the Mona Lisa Europeana will direct you to the Louvre s website 23 Concerns about ownership and especially about the ability to point to web traffic as a metric for successful community engagement pervade discussions about how Europeana should interact with one of its key audiences cultural heritage institutions donating their data about their collections Europeana s approach to aggregation is very reasonable aggregate the metadata but access the digital objects from the providers sites This allows the provider to brand the content with their own identity and to offer up navigation and context pertinent to the content It also precludes the need for Europeana to have to centrally store all of the digital objects and the responsibility for preservation remains with the owning institution Erway 2009 108 24 The technological discussions raise this same concern <PERSON>Cesare Concordia</PERSON> el al call for both a unified mentality shift when dealing with large scale aggregations while also noting that ownership must be clearly visible to two additional key audiences imagined users who will visit the portal and search for content and those who will build applications and other projects on top of the data and data model <PERSON>Concordia Gradmann</PERSON> and Siebinga 2010 67 25 If the foregoing section identifies three audiences the individual searching via the portal the cultural heritage institutions that submit CHOs and developers using the API there are a further two audiences implied in the case set of texts about Europeana though they are not necessarily explicitly defined as such therein <PERSON>Karen M Wickett</PERSON> et al point to the audiences implied in the functional roles of collections and collection description individual users accessing or contributing content system developers seeking to improve search experiences and institutions providing data to federated aggregations <PERSON>Wickett Isaac Doerr Fenlon Meghini</PERSON> and <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> 2014 This suggests the fourth audience which emerges through more recent projects like Europeana 1914 1918 for the World War I centenary By relying on individuals to submit content directly based on personal or family experiences of the War the fourth audience is distinct from the other donor audience of often publicly or state sponsored cultural heritage institutions We also argue that there is a fifth audience construction here and that this is precisely a mirror of self the I in I methodology Akrich 1995 This last audience manifests itself in Europeana in a few ways Firstly there is an actual user base which is constructed via the peers and colleagues of those involved in the Europeana technical programs and secondly there are the technologies developed for Europeana which act as a mirror of self both in the sense of mirroring the ideological and epistemological standpoint of the developers but also in the sense that technological tools mirror the nebulous identity construction of the larger Europeana project 26 Developments that stem from Europeana like the creation of the data model EDM and an interface designed to encourage developers to use Europeana the API are inflected with the identities designers have in mind and who they think they are talking to For example <ORGANIZATION>Concordia</ORGANIZATION> et al write about the Europeana API to differentiate it from other portals and other digital libraries <ORGANIZATION>Concordia Gradmann</ORGANIZATION> and Siebinga 2010 65 In fact the authors imply that the technical designers do not talk to Europeana portal users and distance themselves from the notion that Europeana is a portal at all Rather they describe the portal as simply one small use of the API and this branch of research and development is seen as distinct from work on the EDM While they are both technological projects under the general Europeana umbrella exchanges on <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> user group pages for Europeana s API highlight the gulf between those who see themselves as working on the API versus those who work on the data model In one instance when someone on a forum asked a question regarding a functional ontology for their home institution in this case a museum they were quickly referred away to the EDM people by the <ORGANIZATION>API Google</ORGANIZATION> group Yet the <ORGANIZATION>Concordia</ORGANIZATION> et al paper which argues for an understanding of Europeana as an API counters this notion by appealing to different audiences <ORGANIZATION>Concordia Gradmann</ORGANIZATION> and Siebinga 2010 65 That is to say it is an API for those developers in the know those already working at Europeana and those developers Europeana hope will take up the API 27 A competing discourse arises when the primary user audience is invoked the non specialist who uses the europeana eu search bar to look for art works These portal users are coded by the technical authors as detached from the complexity of the underlying technologies such as the call method architecture data system levels and functionalities At the same time <ORGANIZATION>Concordia</ORGANIZATION> et al use language about hiding things in the API and a techno centric discourse is employed to purposefully mask the complexity of these functionalities behind graphical user interfaces GUIs in this case the simple search box on the website landing page <ORGANIZATION>Concordia Gradmann</ORGANIZATION> and Siebinga 2010 65 28 These issues draw attention to Europeana s lack of definition around audiences Because it does not concretely define audience when speaking to its audience writ large it implicates a variety of actors with different interests and levels of power in relation to the project Defining the various audiences of Europeana would require the explicit designation of techno audiences including second party developers at partner institutions and external third party developers like the humanistic researcher investigating watermarks on historical documents Instead Europeana literature switches back and forth between discussions of the first four distinct audiences as though they fit within the same group moreover it never addresses the fifth I audience explicitly 29 What is the potential impact of eliding distinct audiences in this way When audiences are assumed rather than defined they default to norms that reinforce existing power relationships Developers design for themselves representing assumed users on both the technological side where API users may in fact share many traits with Europeana developers and on the public access side where portal users often school children doing class projects probably do not As such the portal model suffers from not being what casual access users need in technical terms online access to collections is not serving a clear user need Erway 2009 104 Europeana promotes itself as a rich resource with enough depth to support serious research yet this kind of take up by scholars has not been seen on the portal side or on the API side In all these discussions another key audience is never mentioned because it is obscured in the definitional vacuum of Europeana itself what do heritage institutions get out of their participation in Europeana This is part and parcel of the tension around concepts of ownership mentioned earlier and speaks to the all and each relationship whereby individual contributions are re aligned with the totalizing effects of government 30 Europeana structures itself around its projected audiences The most clearly identifiable organizational audiences are also what it relies on to provide content both organizations and individuals donating content as well as individuals searching for content Yet Europeana also structures itself around audiences that are less explicitly defined such as those that are incorporated into the design of the API and the EDM which we will address in greater detail in the next section Europeana emphasizes the fact that it wants to incorporate absorb existing descriptive metadata structures in use by partner institutions it builds on many standards that are in popular use to maximize the ease of interoperability and encourage the participation of institutional partners Europeana 2014 12 This type of move reflects the policy motif of unity in diversity unification through the aggregation of diverse heritage 31 When the audience is functionally a mirror of the project creators both the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> and the tech developers it does not necessarily reflect the way people would actually use or contribute to a digital heritage portal As <PERSON>Ben Roberts</PERSON> writes how meaningful is such participation when its terms and vocabulary are decided elsewhere Indeed what can appear to happen in such debates is a kind of staged engagement with the outside one which simply mirrors the political establishment <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> 2009 This tension is further complicated by the fact that success in this realm is difficult to define while it is often lamented that students are the most prevalent group of users of the portal it is unclear who else might use Europeana on a regular basis The development of the EDM to which the discussion will now turn highlights similar issues with regard to the potential problems that arise in the uncertain space between the developers ambitions and the needs of organizational and individual users The EDM 32 The Europeana Data Model EDM is the successor of the <ORGANIZATION>European Semantic Elements ESE</ORGANIZATION> metadata which were used to describe the digital objects aggregated by Europeana Both the <ORGANIZATION>ESE</ORGANIZATION> and EDM govern the use of metadata in the larger Europeana project with the aim of creating interoperability between discrete digital collections The EDM came about in response to claims that the <ORGANIZATION>ESE</ORGANIZATION> was inadequate to properly express the relationships between CHOs and their digital surrogates The EDM a Resource Description Framework RDF based data model incorporates the existing elements from the <ORGANIZATION>ESE</ORGANIZATION> along with additional elements from several other common metadata schemas such as Simple and Qualified Dublin Core title format author etc it is also compatible and partly aligned with the major cultural heritage ontology CIDOC CRM Amad and Bouha 2017 <PERSON>Peroni Tomasi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vitali</PERSON> 2012 The EDM was implemented as part of Europeana s Linked Open Data LOD pilot The documentation about the LOD pilot indicates the shifting nature of Europeana s project EDM creators note the fact that the LOD pilot was limited from the outset given that the Data Exchange Agreement between donors and Europeana did not specifically call for partner institutions to give permissions to make metadata publicly available Linked open data as the open in its name suggests is based on the ability to share metadata to make linkages work Because the agreement partner institutions sign with Europeana does not entail public permissions the exchanges of metadata necessary to link data openly are limited <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> et al write about the process of moving Europeana s database towards open data explaining It was important that the solution chosen by Europeana should reuse existing standards and be flexible enough in its approach to interoperability to allow their coexistence with custom ones from across the sector Because Europeana wants to reuse and be reused a web based open technology was ideal to make it simple to connect data together and share it Such semantic web and linked data technologies directly relate to open data strategies <PERSON>Isaac Clayphan</PERSON> and Haslhofer 2012 40 33 This type of language also exemplifies attempts by those involved with Europeana to unify elements of the project and to project backwards a more unified vision of Europeana s development than other events on the timeline indicate To maximize interoperability the EDM builds on a commonly used schema like the <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> Core Internet metadata standard As <PERSON>Ashraf Amad</PERSON> and Nasreddine Bouha explain its primary objective is to unify descriptions originating from various metadata providers to make data accessible on the Europeana website independently of the metadata schema used by the provider <PERSON>Amad</PERSON> and Bouha 2017 168 In this way cultural heritage institutions can move local data about CHOs directly into the <LOCATION>EDM</LOCATION> without having to do metadata crosswalking which is to say without engaging in the practice of translating some fields for information to match those fields existing in a different standard that might have different rules or use different types of vocabularies This type of functionality indicates a shift away from a sole focus on schema development towards creating methods for interoperability and translation between existing schemas <PERSON>McDonough</PERSON> 2008 34 However the creation of the EDM raised concerns about a flattening of relationships between pieces of information Specifically the need to attribute authority to particular statements presented technological challenges to the developers We identify two sources of these challenges although there are likely more Firstly the need for proper attribution stems from the complex negotiations between donating institutions who need to demonstrate clear ownership of artworks and the associated digital surrogates and metadata Secondly the EDM has to contend with potentially conflicting information given to Europeana by its numerous donors <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> the framework used by the <ORGANIZATION>EDM</ORGANIZATION> employs simple triples to structure data a subject and an object are linked by a predicate or property Cyganiac Wood and Lanthaler 2014 image Figure 2 An explanation of the basic structure of <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> from creator W3C s documentation image Figure 3 <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> triples employed in the EDM Isaac 2013 35 Europeana relies on its relationships with content donors who were until the 1914 1918 World War I project primarily cultural heritage institutions from the Eurozone Such donors are contributing valuable data to Europeana Europeana relies on these institutions to create more or less interoperable metadata on which the entire database and platform run and therefore relationships with these institutions must be cultivated If two contributing institutions submit conflicting metadata about the same CHO say for example one attributes an anonymous artwork to one artist while another institution attributes it to someone else standard database logic does not allow for such contradictions to exist simultaneously accommodating contradictions within a database permits it to represent all its assertions as true as well as all its negations which would bring down a functional database Yet Europeana requires a structure that allows institutions to retain their own information as authoritatively true precisely because it aims to side step disagreements about artist attribution Therefore developers opted for a mechanism that allows contradictions to exist within the database without ruining the database s functionality This is accomplished through the use of proxy elements which attribute the authority of statements to a particular agent <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> et al describe the proxies as Enabl ing the separation of different views of the same item that may be the focus of multiple aggregations from different providers In every case there will be one proxy for the provider descriptive data for an item and another for the data created by Europeana <PERSON>Isaac Clayphan</PERSON> and Haslhofer 2012 38 36 Europeana developed the proxy notion from the Open Reuse and Exchange ORE specification <PERSON>Peroni Tomasi</PERSON> and Vitali 2012 Proxies separate the items themselves from the information about them As such a work of art can simultaneously be attributed to two different artists with the caveat that one attribution comes from one authority while the second comes from another image Figure 4 From the EDM primer a diagram wherein we have noted the use of proxies emphasis added by the authors in red 37 These contradictions are especially important in the cultural heritage sector when representing information such as provenance which can be questionable and institutionally dependent or date ranges which differ depending on perspectives and definitions Contradictions must be represented in a way that retains the integrity of the database structure and this can be challenging For example in an LOD project using CIDOC CRM to create an interoperable LOD dataset of World War I data and objects the authors note formal encoding of such different viewpoints has been discussed but remains future work <PERSON>Makela Tornroos Lindquist</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hyvonen</PERSON> 2016 The proxies in EDM are designed to accommodate both the programmers who accept an inelegant use of <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> because it allows for functional programs and the cultural heritage providers who can claim authority over their own collections 38 The politics embedded in the technological foundations of the EDM allow the contributing institutions a measure of autonomy that has in turn solidified the functionality of the Europeana project as a whole There is a difficulty in the work of an aggregator like Europeana in that it is engaged by definition with many partners As such this tension can be described partly as one of scale in moving beyond a single institution Europeana must find a way to grant a visible measure of authority to many partners across many nations 39 Digital archive technologies describe such problems of scale for heritage representations as technical ones thus depoliticizing or decentring the friction Tsing 2005 that inherently occurs in multi scalar projects like Europeana <PERSON>Anna Tsing</PERSON> uses the term friction to signal the awkward sites of interconnection across difference Tsing 2005 4 Collaborative partners that share the same goals without necessarily sharing other commonalities embody a similar friction The EDM corresponds to the way friction works proposing a technological solution for what is an inherently political problem in a way that decenters the power dynamics that arise when actors at individual organizational national and supranational scales are thrown together 40 A key feature of the governmental rationality of all and each is that it can be made to accommodate the politics of difference It is flexible and aimed at absorbing that which initially seems to unsettle it making the seamful appear seamless Sherratt 2015 The use of proxies in the EDM is an example of this seamlessness and the way in which it is used to accommodate difference A purposefully seamful way to handle disparities in data would acknowledge and present the difference to a user and this could be accomplished within an <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> schema using a named graph see <PERSON>Amad</PERSON> and Bouha 2017 for an explanation of this In the EDM conversely proxies are seamless in that they accommodate differences by creating silos Within one silo one thing is true while within another silo a different thing is true The result is that when a user is viewing information the differences are not apparent only what is valid within the user s particular silo is visible We place this concept of seamlessness into dialogue with the privileged position of neutrality often afforded to technological spaces the <LOCATION>EDM</LOCATION> can claim a political neutrality because it frames itself as a solution to a technological problem of data representation In fact we argue that the EDM like the other technologies that together constitute the nebulous entity of Europeana occupies a place of enormous privilege in the way it chooses to represent its heritage collections a choice that is in itself inherently political 41 This issue links back to the definitional void described above the lack of definition for a European cultural heritage in Europeana mirrors a lack of definition around the European project more generally Europeana operates as a form of soft power and a somewhat indirect arbiter making its power all the more difficult to render visible In entering into data agreements for aggregation cultural heritage institutions enter into the all and each dynamic the actions they take to exert authority over their own collections while perhaps raising their own profile through their partnership with Europeana are mutually constitutive of the governmental rationality of culture exercised by the <ORGANIZATION>EC Conclusion</ORGANIZATION> 42 In this article we have argued that the study of Europeana has much to contribute to the debates about the relationship between technical expertise the representation of heritage and the exercise of government First this case study demonstrates the move of all and each all and each is embedded in Europeana s very invitation to participate and it implicates its conception of audiences in the same gesture Second it highlights the effects of a definitional void dominant power relations fill a definitional void The ambition of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is unity but if and when it cannot express that directly particularly in the current fraught political environment it instead chooses to emphasize diversity This is not a logically incompatible goal but it moves people in an indirect trajectory towards unity the terms change but the goal does not 43 The indirect movement towards unity is reflected in the development of the EDM a space that masks frictional aspects of its networks and relationships Caswell 2013 Those in charge of technological developments have the power to remove themselves and their work from spaces of frictional engagement wherein democratically important decisions might be taken This is accomplished by purposefully focusing on the technological problem and its resolution in order to depoliticize it Hence the problem of representing different and potentially conflicting national heritage collections becomes a technical conversation about technical problems However we argue that such conversations cannot happen without reference to social and political frameworks even though these tensions are masked in the organizational language of Europeana and the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> 44 Friction as <PERSON>Tsing</PERSON> describes it has the potential to be productive Tsing 2005 4 In the realm of metadata a move towards translation across schemas as opposed to the ongoing creation of new schemas that vie for dominance could be one result of productive friction such friction both requires and allows communities to come into contact Professionalizing the task of data model creation to unify and standardize metadata across cultural heritage institutions is an elegant solution to a difficult problem even if Europeana s use of <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> is a somewhat inelegant use of an ostensibly straightforward framework But the professionalized environment in which Europeana was created is also a political one underpinned by the drive for European cohesion as we have shown in this article As such there is no requirement to open such processes up to debate in ways that preclude the project s European character or to create a space for dialogue as part of the development process 45 Yet as we have also argued technical solutions for political problems do not necessarily work even when they work Responding to the questions this article raises increasingly so because of the current uncertainty surrounding the future of the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> demands openness of process without assuming total interoperability To that end we propose a challenge to the idea of interoperability as total and seamless assimilation There are ways in which interoperability could be productively frictional but are not because of the discourses of neutrality around technology and because of the political forces motivating Europeana s technological development Europeana is not neutral it is a project and tool aimed at promoting European unity The totalizing and individualizing move of unity in diversity does not take account of the way different heritages also work against each other creating a space of friction It is from this space of friction we argue that we can find the means to fill a definitional void in a way that contests existing power relations This friction has the potential to allow tools like Europeana to be used in a recuperative fashion rather than as a technique of government on a supranational scale Acknowledgments 46 The authors wish to acknowledge the collegial support of Dr <PERSON>David Dubin</PERSON> in the research and writing of this article Works Cited
