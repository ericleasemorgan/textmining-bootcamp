the vast terrain of culturomics focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000 We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography the evolution of grammar collective memory the adoption of technology the pursuit of fame censorship and historical epidemiology Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities Comment in Culturomics periodicals gauge culture s pulse Science 2011 Culturomics
