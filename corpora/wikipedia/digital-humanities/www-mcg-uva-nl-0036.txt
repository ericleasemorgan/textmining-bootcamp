Abstract


Given the observation that for most humanities scholars the use of ICT has not progressed beyond word-processing, simple databases, email and browsing the web, one could conclude that, apparently, there is no real need for more advanced uses of ICT. However, in some specific areas of the humanities --including archeology, linguistics, media studies and music-- ICT did allow for new research questions and new methodologies to emerge. This paper focuses on the role of ICT in music research, especially on the influence it had on the development of the fields of empirical and cognitive musicology.
