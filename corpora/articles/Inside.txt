ASIS&T Hires 
New Executive Director

ASIS&T to
Celebrate 
Its Incredible
History at 80th
Annual Meeting 

T he ASIS&T Board of Directorsannounces the hiring of Lydia
Middleton, MBA, CAE, as its new
executive director. Middleton, who
began work in May, was hired after an
extensive search from a pool of 200
applicants.
“On behalf of the ASIS&T Board, I

am thrilled to welcome Lydia
Middleton as our new executive
director,” Lynn Silipigni Connaway,
ASIS&T president says. “Lydia brings a
wealth of experience leading non-profit
scholarly and professional associations.
She has increased revenue and

expanded membership by introducing
new opportunities for sponsorships,
collaboration and engagement. As
ASIS&T celebrates its 80th
anniversary, the Board believes Lydia is
the best person to lead us into a new
period of growth and increased
offerings for our members.” 
Lydia has served as executive

director with the American Academy of
Orthotists and Prosthetists, the
Association for University Programs in
Health Administration and the David
A. Winston Health Policy Fellowship.
She also serves as an adjunct faculty
member at George Washington
University.
“I am tremendously excited to be

joining the team at ASIS&T,” remarked
Middleton. “ASIS&T is an organization
which has had a long and successful
tradition of service to the information
science community. I look forward to
continuing that tradition while seeking
new opportunities for member
engagement, strategic growth and
enhanced impact for the organization.”
Lydia succeeds Dick Hill who retired

this year after nearly 30 years as
ASIS&T executive director. �

S ome 80 years ago, a group ofindividuals nominated by and
representing major scientific and
professional societies, foundations and
government agencies got together to
form the American Documentation
Institute (ADI) with the expressed
purpose of using microfilm as an
information storage medium and
reproduction tool. Could Watson Davis
and his contemporaries have known
where their efforts to find ways to
conserve publication space in technical
journals would take the soon-to-be-
named field of information science?
Now, in 2017, ADI is the Association

for Information Science and Technology
(ASIS&T), and ASIS&T is celebrating
its 80 years of service to the field of
information science and the technologies
it has both helped spawn and incorporate
into the vast information age in which
we now live and work. This fall in the
suburbs of Washington, DC, where it
all began, ASIS&T and its members will
raise their glasses in honor of all they
have done in support of the profession.P

Diversity of Engagement:
Connecting People and Information
in the Physical and Virtual Worlds
is the theme of the 80th anniversary
meeting, focusing on the diverse ways in
which people from different backgrounds,
cultures and disciplines forge connections
with each other, discover and use
information, and engage with technology.
The meeting is October 27-November 1,
2017, headquartered at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel in Arlington, Virginia. 
Two incredible keynote speakers

have been identified for the plenary
sessions at this year’s event. Richard
Marks, senior research engineer and
head of the PlayStation Magic Lab at
Sony Interactive Entertainment, and
William Powers, best-selling author
of Hamlet’s Blackberry: A Practical
Philosophy for Building a Good Life in
the Digital Age, will set the tone each
day for what promises to be an exciting
look at where the field is headed.
Marks, who has worked at Sony’s

game division for 17 years, is widely
acknowledged as one of the pioneers of
virtual reality. He was an avionics
major at MIT before getting his Ph.D.
in aeronautics and astronautics from
Stanford University. His thesis, done in
conjunction with the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute, was in
the area of visual sensing for automatic
control of an underwater robot. He
then joined Teleos Research, a computer

vision start-up that was later acquired
by Autodesk. Inspired in 1999 by the
unveiling of PlayStation 2, he joined
PlayStation R&D to investigate the use
of live video input for gaming and
develop new interactive experiences.
Powers graduated from Harvard

University with a degree in U.S. history
and literature, and he did graduate
work in Spain as a Rotary International
Scholar. He began his career as a U.S.
Senate staffer working on foreign
relations, intelligence and military affairs.
He then transitioned into journalism
and writing, holding a staff position at
The Washington Post, and writing for
The Atlantic, The New York Times and
many other publications. Hamlet’s

Blackberry grew out of research he did as
a fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center.
The book has been widely praised for its
insights on the digital future. Since 2014,
Powers has been with the MIT Media
Lab as a research scientist developing
new technologies for journalism,
governance and the public sphere.
Though the deadlines for most

submissions for presentations at the
Annual Meeting have passed, proposals
for visual presentation and for the
doctoral colloquium are still being
accepted. For full information about
submissions, please check in at

are experimenting with LOD for two
collections of theater-related images
and one text-based collection
pertaining to the life and works of
Marcel Proust (~20,000 items in all).
In this webinar they will describe

outcomes to date, highlighting a few
unique challenges in transforming
legacy metadata into the more RDF-
compatible semantics of schema.org
and the automated and manual
means used to identify and add links
to item descriptions. They also will

exist on the web today only as
standalone silos of content, not well
connected to related resources. This
impedes discovery and limits available
context when using the content. A

funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, is investigating the core
hypothesis that a Linked Open Data
(LOD) approach to description could
improve the connectedness of many
digitized special collections. To begin
testing this hypothesis, the researchers

show how they have leveraged LOD to
enhance end-user views of resource
descriptions. Now when a user views
images in context, JavaScript on the
page reads embedded LOD and
retrieves additional links and
descriptions in real-time from external
LOD services. Mustache.js templates
are then used to dynamically add this
related information to the HTML
display providing additional context
and clickable links regarding the
people (authors, actors, directors,
etc.), venues (theaters), plays and
performances related to each digitized
image. Project website:

subject taxonomies and name
authority files, such as the Library of
Congress Name Authority File,
DBpedia and the Getty Linked Open
Data Vocabularies collection, can be
used for content enrichment and
indexing.
There will be a brief discussion of

the general principles of graph
databases, RDF triple stores and the
SPARQL query language. This
technical segment will discuss the pros
and cons of accessing remote server
endpoints versus cached copies of
external linked data resources, as well
as the challenge of providing high-
performance full text search against
graph databases.
The webinar will conclude by

providing a demonstration of Linked
Canvas to illustrate various end-user
experiences that can be created with
linked data technology: faceted search
across data collections; pinch and
zoom navigation inside images; the
exploration of concepts and ideas
associated with specific points of
interest; the discovery of conceptually
related images; and the creation of
guided tours with embedded audio-
visual commentary.

How to Design & Build Semantic
Applications with Linked Data.
Presenter: Dave Clarke
Sponsored by DCMI. Free to ASIS&T
members

This webinar will demonstrate how
to design and build rich end-user
search and discovery applications
using linked data. The Linked Open
Data cloud is a rapidly growing
collection of publicly accessible
resources, which can be adopted and
reused to enrich both internal
enterprise projects and public-facing
information systems.
The webinar will use the Linked

Canvas application as its primary use-
case. Linked Canvas is an application
designed by Synaptica for the cultural
heritage community. It enables high-
resolution images of artworks and
artifacts to be catalogued and subject
indexed using linked data. The talk will
demonstrate how property fields and
relational predicates can be adopted
from open data ontologies and
metadata schemes, such as DCMI,
SKOS, IIIF and the Web Annotation
Model. Selections of properties and
predicates can then be recombined to
create knowledge organization systems
(KOS) customized for business
applications. The demonstration will
also illustrate how very-large-scale

ASIS&T Meet the Author: Deep
Text Analytics: What Is It and
What Can It Do For You?
Presenter: Tom Reamy
Free to ASIS&T members

Text analytics is an often
misunderstood field that holds
enormous potential for getting more
value out of the most underutilized
resource in most modern
organizations – so called unstructured
text (it’s really poly-structured). It also
can provide new opportunities for
information architecture by providing
a rich new set of tools. This webinar,
based on a new book, Deep Text:
Using Text Analytics to Conquer
Information Overload, Get Real Value
from Social Media, and Add Big(ger)
Text to Big Data, will take attendees
through a complete tour of this

� How do you select the best text 
analytics software for your 
organization?

In addition, the webinar will discuss
the best practices for text analytics
development, including integrating deep
learning and deep text. It will also cover
the full range of applications that can be
built with text analytics in three areas:
search, social media and a class of
applications called info apps. Finally,
the webinar will take a quick look at how
to set up and use text analytics as an
enterprise unstructured text platform.
The webinar will end with a

presentation of some ideas on how text
analytics can enhance information
architecture and information
architecture can add to text analytics.
And we hope you will have plenty of
questions and suggestions on this
mutual enrichment. �

exciting new field and demonstrate
how text analytics and information
architecture can mutually enrich each
other.
The webinar will cover the entire

field of text analytics including the
latest-greatest techniques currently
being developed. We will cover these
basic topics:

� What is text analytics?

� What are the major functionality 
areas of text analytics (text mining, 
entity extraction, sentiment 
analysis, automatic summarization 
and automatic categorization)?

� What is the basic business value of 
text analytics?

� What is the current state of text 
analytics?

� How can organizations get started 
with text analytics?
