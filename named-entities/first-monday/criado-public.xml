Villodre</PERSON> image Abstract This paper analyzes the interactions that public employees perform in social media communities providing empirical evidence on the dynamics of internal collaboration In general terms this study responds to a rising interest in the study of social media communities as tools for co production and innovation In doing so this paper asks the following research questions How do interactions among public employees occur within a social media community What factors determine the number of interactions in a public sector specific social media community For this purpose our study analyzes NovaGob the most active digital social media community of public sector innovation in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> By using social network analysis SNA we provide evidence on the importance of formal and informal power in stimulating participation Moreover we show how interest and will to collaborate influences the number of interactions Finally this study uses a gender variable to discuss the possible existence of a second digital gender gap which affects how public sector employees use these communities This paper advances some conclusions about the behavior of public employees collaborating in social media communities suggesting the need for future attention to inter agency phenomenon Contents Introduction Theoretical framework and hypotheses formulation Methods Data and results Findings and discussion Conclusions bookmark p1 Introduction During the past few years there have been notable advances in the adoption of social media in the public sector The rapid diffusion of these innovations coupled with their highly disruptive potential Criado et al 2017 <PERSON>Bannister</PERSON> and <PERSON>Connolly</PERSON> 2014 <PERSON>Chun</PERSON> et al 2010 have generated great expectations based on their capacity to help improving areas of transparency collaboration and participation Mergel 2015 Bertot et al 2010 This paper explores one of these areas internal collaboration among public employees focusing on analyzing their interactions through social media communities and studying factors that influence those interactions This may help not only to understand how collaboration is generated but also identify barriers to the use of digital social technologies in order to deliver innovation and collaboration in government Internal collaboration has been boosted by transformations linked to social media generalization The Web 2 0 philosophy the expansion of open data as well as a generalization of principles and values of transparency participation and collaboration would be converging to inspire a different way of understanding public management Criado 2016 This phenomenon initially labelled as peer to peer government or wiki oriented government Kostakis 2010 has begun to be framed under the name of smart governance <PERSON>Gil Garc</PERSON> a et al 2016 Noveck 2015 a new paradigm that would bring together ideas expressed on public participation Charalabidis and Loukis 2012 open government and creation of public value <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> et al 2012 and collaboration <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> 2015 This new paradigm proposes the use of the wisdom of the crowds for the solution of public problems It has as defining elements the use of new channels of communication based on social media communities a focus on external collaboration and participation Batagan 2011 new forms of coordination in order to achieve public goals a new smart decision making policy process with peer participation and a renewed version of e administration capable of interacting with the public online in the delivery of services and in fulfilling their predesignated mandates bookmark 1a 1 Nevertheless studies on internal collaboration using social media are still scarce In a recent literature review Medaglia and <PERSON>Zheng</PERSON> 2017 detected the need to increase and refine studies on user behaviour and collaboration This gap is even more brutal in papers that study collaboration among public employees Criado et al 2017 Few studies are highlighting how public empoyees are gradually starting informal and inter agency collaborations through social media We offer as one of the most outstanding examples the study of Mergel 2015 about public servant communities in GitHub a social media community where individuals and organizations share code and make the process of developing public software a collaborative activity Likewise we should highlight the case of <PERSON>GovLoop Sadeghi</PERSON> et al 2012 a social media community for English speaking public employees that favours discussion and networking opportunities between officials journalists contractors consultants and scholars This work aims at becoming in an exploratory way a first attempt to approach the process of collaboration and interaction in social media communities by public employees Using social network analysis <ORGANIZATION>SNA</ORGANIZATION> this paper focus on NovaGob a social media community recently mentioned as an international case study With more than 12 000 registered public employees it has become the most active digital community of public sector innovation in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and Latin American GovLab 2016 Using <PERSON>NovaGob</PERSON> as the main source for data our study proposes as research questions the following RQ 1 How interactions between public employees occur within a social media community RQ 2 What factors determine the number of interactions in a public sector specific social media community This paper is structured as follows First we focus on reviewing literature about internal collaboration and open collaboration showing linkage to the smart governance paradigm After that the SNA methodology is presented suitable for its capacity to address relational issues <PERSON>Hennig</PERSON> et al 2013 After the operationalization of the variables our study continues making a descriptive analysis of <ORGANIZATION>NovaGob</ORGANIZATION> and delves into the exploratory analysis through two great debates that emerged in the early moments of the social network Finally the main findings are presented offering conclusions about analysed data and other ideas derived from a discussion of results image bookmark p2 Literature review and hypotheses formulation The concept of social media communities has been revolving around the terms of participation and collaboration When we talk about collaboration in the public sector we refer to the processes and mechanisms of involvement in the design production provision and evaluation of public services As <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zheng</PERSON> bookmark 2a 2 have pointed out government agencies employ collaboration to share public authorities information and resources to enhance capabilities or to solve large scale problems by making and implementing public policies together In that sense collaboration will be different depending on where it occurs under which culture and management conditions or whether it is formally or voluntarily implemented <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> and Zheng 2015 Collaboration in the public sector has been strongly enhanced by social media The capabilities of those technologies have increased the possibilities of collaboration offering two way interactive platforms that offer cross boundary action and networking possibilities for citizen co production <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> 2013 but also for interaction and co production between public employees Criado et al 2017 <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> 2015 In that sense social media communities have made collaboration become open by enabling anyone to participate in the collaborative process regardless time and space and to benefit from sharing profits Forte and <PERSON>Lampe</PERSON> 2013 Internal collaboration in the public sector Internal collaboration has been a desired goal to fight against the complexity of organizations and societies Initially terminology was channelled through inter agency collaboration as an optimistic way of displacing individualistic forms in the organization unable to efficiently solve certain public problems <LOCATION>Hudson</LOCATION> et al 1999 Collaboration is the driving motive for intergovernmental networks and it is a critical motivator in collaborative public management <LOCATION>Kapucu</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Demiroz</PERSON> 2011 As <PERSON>Chun</PERSON> et al 2011 noted this kind of collaboration needs strong alignments between objectives strategies tasks processes and knowledge resources The emergence of social media communities has greatly facilitated collaboration It is no longer the organizations but public employees themselves who individually have the possibility to collaborate <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> 2015 The case of <PERSON>GovLoop Sadeghi</PERSON> et al 2012 proves the need raised by public employees to interact with each other not only to socialize but to share good practices and ideas for the improvement of organizations and public services This type of collaboration platforms conceived as specialized social media Yi et al 2013 <PERSON>Oliveira</PERSON> and <PERSON>Welch</PERSON> 2013 <PERSON>Zheng</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zheng</PERSON> 2014 <PERSON>Cumbie</PERSON> and Kar 2015 are usually focused on public employees work In many cases they include a certain openness to other sectors involved with the public sector bringing those social media communities closer to open collaboration <PERSON>Sadeghi</PERSON> et al 2012 Open collaboration in the public sector As a concept open collaboration has recently been introduced in public management theories Open collaboration refers to a system of production and innovation <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and Prietula 2013 Open collaboration is a dynamic process by which public sector employees contribute adding value to a product or service Mergel 2015 This value creation occurs through open online environments characterized as noted by <PERSON>Forte</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lampe</PERSON> 2013 by supporting the collective creation of a product or service presenting low barriers to entry and exit and under the support characterized by high persistence and malleable structures Unlike other production processes and collective innovation such as crowdsourcing where the public organization has a predominant role in setting tasks and objectives towards a non expert volunteer community usually participants who help in the process of problem solving <PERSON>Brabham</PERSON> 2013 <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desouza</PERSON> 2013 open collaboration occurs in a persistent interaction between public employees and citizens that together define both objectives and structures <PERSON>Forte</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lampe</PERSON> 2013 In open collaboration opportunities to forge consensus and social innovation are the main pieces of this new collaborative experience <PERSON>Forte</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lampe</PERSON> 2013 Finally as <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> bookmark 3a 3 points outs open collaboration is usually not incentivized with monetary prize payments Diving into a new paradigm Smart governance Taking into consideration innovation constraints faced by public employees some initiatives have emerged enabling collaboration processes Efforts to overcome traditional barriers of time and space have been supported by some public employees <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desouza</PERSON> 2013 and have pinpointed the differences between private and public settings and the problems of implementation of public policies derived from a lack of attention to these differences <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Desouza</PERSON> 2013 A new paradigm named smart governance has encouraged many researchers to explore how networks partnerships and other forms of interaction between different actors and organizations can serve to revitalize and incorporate new ideas in problem solving <PERSON>Gil Garc</PERSON> a et al 2016 Noveck 2015 S rensen and Torfing 2012 As a paradigm smart governance is based on the concept of collaboration as a mechanism for solving public problems Under this framework our governments and public administrations become platforms <PERSON>Lathrop</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ruma</PERSON> 2010 which operate through a more open state and a more flexible public sector Criado 2016 This process implies the promotion of innovation and collaboration processes which increase the capacity of the public sector to solve problems by capturing external knowledge of its own employees and ultimately of citizens <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> 2015 <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> et al 2013 In short it implies a new way of understanding public management in a more pluralistic way and under new principles and values based on Web 2 0 philosophy and collaborative ethics Smart governance pinpoints a the use of digital platforms both for citizen participation as well as internal and external collaboration within an organization b a new managerial style focused on innovative experts specialized in detecting and creating pubic value by using external collaborative knowledge c defining citizens as co producers d an environment pervaded by the so called collaborative economy and finally e a model of social interaction based upon a notion of community Criado 2016 <PERSON>Luna Reyes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gil Garc</PERSON> a 2014 <PERSON>Chun</PERSON> et al 2010 However this paradigm asks multiple questions especially around collaboration How will public employees collaborate when we know that in many public administrations there are inflexible and highly routinized structures insufficiently committed to innovation The study of factors influencing interactions into a digital innovation community Scholars have tended to give different responses depending on the entity analyzed to the question of how interactions between public employees occur within social media communities They have generally highlighted various interaction pathways including connections among contacts of a contact list within thematic groups or in spaces such as blogs wikis forums or debates In her study about the Github community <PERSON>Mergel</PERSON> 2015 analyzed interactions between actors when developing public code through repositories a group focused on sharing software In the case of <PERSON>GovLoop Sadeghi</PERSON> et al 2012 highlighted the work of public employees through groups and discussion forums as main entities where interactions are conducted Thus one might expect that interactions occur in two distinct ways On the one hand by the direct contact friend list of public employees in a network and on the other by using thematic groups Leadership has proven to be a key element in maintaining network collaboration Agranoff and <PERSON>McGuire</PERSON> bookmark 4a 4 emphasized that the leader as craftsman elicits common goals creates an atmosphere of trust organizational brokers and individual contributions and deploys energies in accord with some strategic plan In this sense the leader becomes a central icon to maintain a cohesive network being a powerful actor that coordinates processes and encourages participation in these networks Agranoff and McGuire 2001 Leadership has also proved to be especially important in social media communities and open source projects <PERSON>Hamel</PERSON> and Schweik 2009 to maintain direction and coordinate participation generate content and direct useful recruitments Lev On 2017 This perspective has been partially maintained recently and has been used by other studies such as <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zheng</PERSON> 2015 to evaluate collaboration between departments in public agencies Thus we argue that H1 the number of interactions in a public sector specific social media community depends on the power of a public employee Another factor is the interest of professionals to make collaboration possible <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Prietula</LOCATION> 2013 described interest in collaboration as overcoming cost benefit calculations They developed a typology placing actors as cooperators altruistic highly motivated users reciprocators users involved to some extend but only insomuch that others are collaborating and free riders little interested with significantly low contribution rate and taking advantage of other efforts We argue that H2 the number of interactions in a public sector specific social media community depends on the interest of public employees to collaborate Finally we address gender as a traditional factor of digital divide and predictor of differences in social media communities Public administrators have made strong efforts to create inclusive work spaces <PERSON>Andrews</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ashworth</PERSON> 2014 Gender has deserved interest within e government studies relative to the conceptual impact of digital divide <PERSON>Gil Garc</PERSON> a et al 2016 <PERSON>Arvidsson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Foka</PERSON> 2015 Some have pointed out the growing access of women to digital services recently outpacing access barriers However women have faced a second digital divide <LOCATION>Criado</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Barrero</PERSON> 2014 which would add new barriers not only to access but also type of use and intensity when interacting with social media Consequently we expect for public employees that H3 the number of interactions in a public sector specific social media community is gender based image bookmark p3 Methods This paper uses <ORGANIZATION>SNA</ORGANIZATION> to analyze the interactions between public employees in social media communities As a research technique <ORGANIZATION>SNA</ORGANIZATION> involves representations of networks and interactions to study social phenomena from a relational perspective <PERSON>Hennig</PERSON> et al 2013 SNA has been widely used in social sciences especially in sociological analysis marketing and communications as well as the study of actors and collective action <PERSON>Hennig</PERSON> et al 2013 The public sector offers other examples some focused on collaboration <PERSON>Provan</PERSON> and Kenis 2008 Rethemeyer and Hatmaker 2008 <LOCATION>Kapucu</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Demiroz</PERSON> 2011 SNA is based on graph theory concepts In short by using graphs we create a graphical representation and visualization of a network of actors and their interactions To refer to these actors this paper uses the term node When we speak about edges we are referring to the links between nodes In the same way our paper also uses the term centrality Centrality as <PERSON>Hennig</PERSON> et al 2013 have pointed out refers to one of the first tasks when analyzing a network to identify the relative importance of each actor Centrality is a topological concept used to describe the relative positions of actors <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bauer</PERSON> 2016 and in social networks there are many ways of expressing that This paper refers to degree which expresses the activity of actors <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bauer</PERSON> 2016 <PERSON>Hennig</PERSON> et al 2013 through the connections adjacencies that these nodes receive Degree either by their external adjacencies out degree or towards themselves in degree is a centrality index and in that sense an indicator of the importance of actors <PERSON>Hennig</PERSON> et al 2013 Since our article only analyzes input and output interactions degree centrality is the preferred choice not taking into account other types of centrality such as betweeness focused on intermediation This paper presents NovaGob as a case study of a social media community specialized in the collaborations of public employees At this point and following the case of GovLoop in the U S and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> NovaGob is the most successful social media community within Spanish speaking countries in terms of a combination of relevance activity number of users and diffusion GovLab 2016 NovaGob is a social media community that allows public employees to interact through debates blogs and wikis The core interaction unit of this collaboration is carried out on thematic groups In these thematic groups activity is mainly conducted by debates as entities that all community members are allowed to open or join For the purpose of our study this analysis focuses on some of the most representative debates that appeared in the first stages of NovaGob Fieldwork began in the NovaGob community by extracting data through the use of SNA4Elgg This Web plugin was run on a development subdomain of NovaGob community based on a sample of 2 335 members and 90 groups October 2014 Two databases a unimodal with the relationship in terms of contacts between members of the network and a two mode database representing links between community members and thematic groups were used Both databases were also used to filter inheriting certain attributes such as degree centrality generating two other arrays of data for each of the analyzed debates Graph analysis and visualization were performed using Gephi This analytical approach may raise some ethical concerns The silent nature of software for the analysis of digital communities avoids some potential ethical implications such as the intrusiveness of surveys and interviews that were traditionally used for SNA data collection Hennig et al 2013 Others such as stored data privacy anonymity of the nodes or analysis of inclusion remain as issues Our data extraction and analysis have tried to follow ethical standards specified in the NovaGob Decalogue ensuring the privacy of public employees by identifying them with a unique identifier id and avoiding the publication of account names or other personal and sensitive information Operationalization of variables This paper uses the number of the interactions as a dependent variable The analysis of interactions pins up the category debates and possible actions surrounding them In NovaGob a community member is allowed to open a debate and make it visible to the rest of the community Likewise any member can answer in a debate with two possibilities 1 directly to the posted question or 2 in response to other members Thus this article operationalises the dependant variable by taking into account three possible actions a creation b direct response and c response to members identifying them through out degree and in degree perspectives The first independent variable refers to the power and influence of individuals within the social media community To facilitate an understanding of this variable it is used as a basic centrality measure degree centrality which numerically represents the number of contacts that a particular member has in the contact list This variable can be summarized with the notion that the more contacts you have the more influential you have The second independent variable is the interest that public employees have in collaborating within the social media community The operationalization of this variable derives from typology offered by <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and Prietula 2013 about three categories of members within an online community based on the intensity of their participation We can identify the cooperator has joined more than five thematic groups the reciprocator has joined a range from two to five groups and the free rider has only joined the group under study These groups were identified taking into account the average of users linked to groups Finally the last independent variable entails gender of public employees operationalized in a simple way using the nodal gender attribute male or female This independent variable is relevant as public sector organizations tend to assume equality in gender distribution of employees as noted by data sources of international organizations <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Economic Co</ORGANIZATION> operation and Development OECD 2016 However it is not clear that numbers at work can also be reflected in terms of participation within social media communities Hence it was expected that female members have less activity within the social media community under consideration image bookmark p4 Data and results NovaGob is a social media community that allows public employees to collaborate and exchange knowledge NovaGob facilitates public employees overcoming some of the traditional organizational boundaries and barriers of time and space GovLab 2016 creating a virtual but real space where public employees create content and creatively share in thematic groups debates blogs and wikis GovLab

horizontal social media networks facilitate this process Each user can send a friend request to others forming his or her own network enabling communication channels and establishing a basis for digital collaboration Figure 1 shows these contacts with 2 335 nodes and 14 356 edges The average contact list stands at around 12 contacts bookmark tab1 Table 1 <ORGANIZATION>NovaGob</ORGANIZATION>

popular node 1 616 However other users appear to be much more disconnected nodes in the periphery These professionals a total of 580 appear to have no connections with others The identification of these unconnected nodes excluded from the network as well as compliance and explanation of exclusion factors are also vital to understand how interactions work in digital innovation communities as networks are not only comprised by connected nodes but with disconnected vertex Castells 2013 However this identification exceeds our current analysis But NovaGob is not merely a network It is a social media community As a community its members develop collaborative actions across different entities including debates blogs and wikis developing multiple interactions through collective intelligence Figure 2 and Table 2 show a visualization of membership through groups and provide a general statistical overview of thematic groups bookmark fig2 image Graph showing membership of

members are actively working within NovaGob Indirectly it advances information about the most important hot topics within the public sector Here open government social networks in the public sector smart cities or transparency are among the most popular issues within the social network Our research focuses on two debates belonging to two of this top groups social networks in the public sector

topic in the group <ORGANIZATION>Digital Social Networks</ORGANIZATION> in the Public Sector and gained great interest among members of the group The debate highlighted the importance that the role of community manager was gaining in public sector organizations and how this role was fundamental to foster participation and collaboration within public administration networks The debate received several responses 36 and had a total of 18 participants becoming a hot topic within the community Table 4 shows how the variables were operationalized Our graph is based on these data bookmark tab4

government This debate was created inside the group about Transparency and aimed at creating an operative and collaborative definition of open government by incorporating different elements related to accountability transparency collaboration etc The debate became very popular with 37 responses and 11 participants Table 5 shows the operationalization of the variables for the SNA These data were

5 13 More than 5 Male Results What factors influence the interaction in a public sector specific social media community Our first hypothesis H1 predicted that the number of interactions in a public sector specific social media community depends on the power of each public employee within the social network So this implies that the most powerful public employees in the network also had the highest number of interactions leading the creation of debates constantly interacting and ultimately coordinating exchanges within debates As we can see in our next three figures leadership of debates as determined by number of interactions has tended to correspond to the most powerful actors in the network centrality degree number of contacts This leadership has tended to give a prominent role to the creators of debates occasionally expanding to other actors acting as co leaders In some cases other actors have emerged with intensive interactions despite lower overall power within the social network This is the case of the debate on the role of the community manager Figure 3 Here despite the fact that id 43 creator demonstrated a great power within the network accumulating with id 2164 a high number of interactions two other actors with reduced power id 31989 and id 4498 came on the scene stimulating even higher intensity and greater bidirectional response to other users Interestingly the two most powerful public employees in the network id 49 and id 8943 had a low number of interactions in comparison to other professionals Finally as expected less powerful actors showed low number of interactions bookmark fig3 image Number of interactions depending on the power of public employees for the debate of the role of the community manager Figure 3 Number of interactions depending on the power of public employees for the debate of the role of the community manager Larger nodes show a greater degree centrality by number of contacts in the network Coloured in purple darker nodes correspond to powerful users Note Larger version of figure available here The debate about the definition of open government was very conclusive Figure 4 The most powerful actor id 881 initiated the debate and monopolized a high number of interactions with constant bidirectional interactions with other public employees on the network Another actor with an important interaction density was id 1829 who showed important levels of participation with some bi directionality having less power than id 881 With some exceptions id 1020 less powerful actors within the network presented lower number of interactions bookmark fig4 image Number of interactions depending on the power of public employees for the debate on the definition of open government Figure 4 Number of interactions depending on the power of public employees for the debate on the definition of open government Larger nodes show a greater degree centrality by number of contacts in the network Coloured in purple darker nodes correspond to powerful users Note Larger version of figure available here Our second hypotheses H2 focuses on the question about the interest and will to collaborate of public employees within a public sector specific social media community Here this study distinguished between co operators altruistic users with more interest in collaborating reciprocators cooperating if others do so and free riders non altruistic only interested in the final fruits of participation With few exceptions the results of our analysis confirm the existence of this typology of members within a collaborative network illustrating the importance of will when establishing collaborative relations The first debate about the role of the community manager reflects how the actors with higher number of interactions are often the most co operators id 43 id 49 and id 4498 Figure 5 Reciprocators and free riders normally appear with lower densities at the bottom of the graph The debate showed an intriguing exception id 31989 classified as a free rider while earning a large number of mentions not cooperating but requests for collaboration bookmark fig5 image Number of interactions depending on

community managers In green members marked as cooperators in yellow members marked as reciprocators in orange members marked as free riders Node size is draw by degree centrality by number of contacts Note Larger version of figure available here Consequently the debate on the definition of open government demonstrated co operators as actors with higher number of interactions Figure 6 Actors with id 881 and id 1829 represented the core of the bidirectional relationships within the debate On the other hand it was clear that lower number of interactions corresponded with free riders and reciprocators bookmark fig6 image Number of interactions depending on interest of public employees to collaborate debate on the definition of open government Figure 6 Number of interactions depending on interest of public employees to collaborate debate on the definition of open government In green members marked as cooperators in yellow members marked as reciprocators in orange members marked as

gender based also seems to be verified In both the debate on the CM profile Figure 7 and the definition of open government Figure 8 the presence of women was minimal and in any case very small in

extent for id 8934 coinciding with an actor with a great centrality index within the network Despite this evidence the debate was dominated mainly by interactions between professionals men Female participation was not part of a gender silo that is female to female participation Discussions on the definition of open government showed even lower participation of female public sector employees

<ORGANIZATION>SNA</ORGANIZATION> has allowed us to visualize how interactions and power behave when public employees participate within an existing social media community This study identified the importance of interest and will in boosting collaborative activities Gender was observed as an important variable which we will study more closely in future research This analysis is exploratory and require further empirical work Finding 1 Leadership and power between informal and formal power The influence of certain public employees was fundamental for the promotion of debates and collaboration Much creative activity was directed by a debate owner leading us to think about their stimulating and coordinating roles on the network Agranoff and <PERSON>McGuire</PERSON> 2001 Lev On 2017 It seems evident that without certain members in the community to create and promote debates the current levels of activity and engagement would be difficult to reach Our study has shown that in some cases debates leadership may arise with a low degree centrality Regarding SNA and the functioning of social networks this may lead us to reappraise the appropriateness of measuring power by the number of contacts within a digital social media network In some instances public sector employees with low centrality may not be leaders in the digital network but may be powerful actors outside the virtual world In other words this suggests that formal power relations remain important even though the meritocratic informal community power was gaining ground as a mechanism to gain reputation and stimulate interactions Finding 2 Presence of excluded members The fact that a public sector employee was registered on a social media community did not automatically translate into participation The analysis of the digital social network NovaGob confirmed a high number of registered public employees but for unknown reasons some of them did not participate appearing as excluded from the network As Castells 2013 pointed out excluded members of a network are important in order to understand overall behaviour and interactions within the network In our case study one may emphasize that NovaGob presented lower levels of exclusion in comparison with non specialized and more disseminate networks i e <ORGANIZATION>Facebook</ORGANIZATION> or Twitter Personal identity validation implied low rates of fake or fraudulent profiles within this community GovLab 2016 Being a specialized digital social community facilitated registration based on a public official s specific interests encouraging higher levels of interactions <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and Prietula 2013 Finding 3 Importance of interest and will to do things The results demonstrated the importance of having motivated and interested members cooperating within a digital community As others have indicated <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> and Prietula 2013 greater interest should be reflected with higher levels of interactions in these communities In our analysis natural leaders were public employees classified as cooperators On the other hand a community member fitted within the typology of free rider and who seemed to grab a number of interactions showed the importance of formal leadership within a community In other words the intention to cooperate was a predictor of cooperation within a social media community However free riding practices remain leaving in the air the question about meritocratic practices in social media communities Finding 4 Towards a second digital divide The results about gender variable confirmed the existence of a second digital divide Even with a lack of aggregate data the analysis exhibited the existence of a second gap <PERSON>Criado</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barrero</PERSON> 2014 in the practices that female public sector employees develop within the NovaGob community In all studied debates even those in which female presence was more intense their participation was comparatively lower than their male colleagues In the debate on the role of community managers in the public sector it earned higher attention from female public officials probably because communication areas are traditionally linked to women in the public sector Finally in terms of gender and digital divide there were low levels of use as well as low rates of registered women in debates This behaviour suggests that we still retain certain exclusion mechanisms in collaboration practices even in digital communities image bookmark p6 Conclusions This paper focused on the dynamics of collaboration within social media communities to provide in an exploratory way empirical evidence on the interactions and behaviour of public sector employees These communities have become spaces where public sector employees co produce with other colleagues and create public value This paper discussed how interactions occur and what factors have an impact on behaviour For this purpose we approached the NovaGob community using <ORGANIZATION>SNA</ORGANIZATION> with the intention of explaining a variety of interactions The results though not confirmatory show evidence of the importance of power of certain public sector employees in stimulating participation within these communities Thus this paper identified the importance of cooperating actors to facilitate collaboration Finally we discussed the possible existence of a second digital gender divide affecting how female public officials use these communities Data collected from the NovaGob community illustrated that as in other specialized social media communities civil servants experience two forms of interaction direct contacts through a contact list and collaborative work within group entities It is in these groups where much open collaboration takes place The data also indicated disconnection of some nodes a phenomenon deserving further analysis We were able to identify main actors within analysed debates Filtered by their centrality and influence within discussions some have been seen as fundamental for the cohesion and coordination of debates Something similar occurred with interest shown by public professionals reflecting that without a will of change it was difficult to include innovation and generate community Finally we noted a gender gap in the use of these networks making it difficult for some professionals to access specific groups and debates Future studies about collaboration among public employees will face certain challenges Our results have shown low internal validity and despite empirical evidence these are exploratory and not confirmatory leaving possible generalisations limited to the sample Future studies should examine the complexity of interactions and verify to what extent interactions produce innovation or if public employees learn something new through collective intelligence In sum the study of behaviour and collaboration among public employees in social media communities is in its infancy requiring further research to tackle their implications in public agencies image End of article bookmark author About the authors J <PERSON>Ignacio Criado</PERSON> is an
