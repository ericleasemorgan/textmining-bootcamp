			Transform text feedback into smarter actions

Customers broadcast valuable feedback about your business through surveys, social media, review sites and countless other channels. The problem is, much of this feedback is in written form. It’s unstructured, disorganized and hard to analyze at scale. Medallia Text Analytics uses machine and human learning to automatically analyze text feedback, so you can understand what matters most to your customers and what you can do about it.

						Understand how customers feel … at scale

Medallia transforms text from billions of surveys, social media reactions, reviews, emails, agent notes and more into actionable insights widely accessible across an organization.

						Uncover trends before they’re trending

Our Theme Discovery Engine uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect new issues and trends as they arise, eliminating blind spots and highlighting unexpected problems.

Medallia Text Analytics automatically constructs thousands of clusters of related themes, so you can dive deep into what’s truly driving customer loyalty.
