ASSOCIATED PRESS Jacques Brinon Technology Is Taking Over English Departments The false promise of the digital humanities By <PERSON>Adam Kirsch</PERSON> May 2 2014 The humanities are in crisis again or still But there is one big exception digital humanities which is a growth industry In 2009 the nascent field was the talk of the <ORGANIZATION>Modern Language Association MLA</ORGANIZATION> convention among all the contending subfields a reporter wrote about that year s gathering the digital humanities seem like the first next big thing in a long time Even earlier the <ORGANIZATION>National Endowment for the Humanities</ORGANIZATION> created its <ORGANIZATION>Office of Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> to help fund projects And digital humanities continues to go from strength to strength thanks in part to the <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Foundation</ORGANIZATION> which has seeded programs at a number of universities with large grants most recently 1 million to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Rochester</ORGANIZATION> to create a graduate fellowship Despite all this enthusiasm the question of what the digital humanities is has yet to be given a satisfactory answer Indeed no one asks it more often than the digital humanists themselves The recent proliferation of books on the subject from sourcebooks and anthologies to critical manifestos is a sign of a field suffering an identity crisis trying to determine what if anything unites the disparate activities carried on under its banner Nowadays writes <PERSON>Stephen Ramsay</PERSON> in Defining Digital Humanities the term can mean anything from media studies to electronic art from data mining to edutech from scholarly editing to anarchic blogging while inviting code junkies digital artists standards wonks transhumanists game theorists free culture advocates archivists librarians and edupunks under its capacious canvas Within this range of approaches we can distinguish a minimalist and a maximalist understanding of digital humanities On the one hand it can be simply the application of computer technology to traditional scholarly functions such as the editing of texts An exemplary project of this kind is the Rossetti Archive created by <PERSON>Jerome McGann</PERSON> an online repository of texts and images related to the career of <PERSON>Dante Gabriel Rossetti</PERSON> this is essentially an open ended universally accessible scholarly edition To others however digital humanities represents a paradigm shift in the way we think about culture itself spurring a change not just in the medium of humanistic work but also in its very substance At their most starry eyed some digital humanists such as the authors of the jargon laden manifesto and handbook Digital_Humanities want to suggest that the addition of the high powered adjective to the long suffering noun signals nothing less than an epoch in human history We live in one of those rare moments of opportunity for the humanities not unlike other great eras of cultural historical transformation such as the shift from the scroll to the codex the invention of movable type the encounter with the New World and the Industrial Revolution image Illustration by <PERSON>Smithe</PERSON> The language here is the language of scholarship but the spirit is the spirit of salesmanship the very same kind of hyperbolic hard sell approach we are so accustomed to hearing about the Internet or about <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> s latest utterly revolutionary product Fundamental to this kind of persuasion is the undertone of menace the threat of historical illegitimacy and obsolescence Here is the future we are made to understand we can either get on board or stand athwart it and get run over The same kind of revolutionary rhetoric appears again and again in the new books on the digital humanities from writers with very different degrees of scholarly commitment and intellectual sophistication In Uncharted Erez <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Baptiste Michel</PERSON> the creators of the <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> Ngram Viewer an online tool that allows you to map the frequency of words in all the printed matter digitized by <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> talk up the big data revolution Its consequences will transform how we look at ourselves Big data is going to change the humanities transform the social sciences and renegotiate the relationship between the world of commerce and the ivory tower These breathless prophecies are just hype But at the other end of the spectrum even <PERSON>McGann</PERSON> one of the pioneers of what used to be called humanities computing uses the high language of inevitability Here is surely a truth now universally acknowledged that the whole of our cultural inheritance has to be recurated and reedited in digital forms and institutional structures If ever there were a chance to see the ideological construction of reality at work digital humanities is it Right before our eyes options are foreclosed and demands enforced a future is constructed as though it were being discovered By now we are used to this process since over the last twenty years the proliferation of new technologies has totally discredited the idea of opting out of the future Everyone who ever swore to cling to typewriters record players and letters now uses word processors iPods and e mail There is no room for <LOCATION>Bartlebys</LOCATION> in the twenty first century and if a few still exist they are scorned Bartleby himself was scorned which was the whole point of his preferring not to Extend this logic from physical technology to intellectual technology and it seems almost like common sense to say that if we are not all digital humanists now we will be in a few years As the authors of Digital_Humanities write with perfect confidence in the inexorability and the desirability of their goals the 8 page essay and the 25 page research paper will have to make room for the game design the multi player narrative the video mash up the online exhibit and other new forms and formats as pedagogical exercises In fact the transition to some version of a post verbal future is already taking place Debates in the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> includes a variety of blog posts as well as more formal essays and articles and one of these Mark L Sample s What s Wrong with Writing Essays describes how digital humanities can be applied in pedagogical terms Its great utility in his view is that it can do away with student writing Why must writing especially writing that captures critical thinking be composed of words Why not images Why not sound Why not objects As an example of a digital humanist artifact he offers the anecdote that once in a video game class one student mapped <PERSON>Sid Meier</PERSON> s Pirates 1991 onto a piece of driftwood This captain s log covered with screenshots and overlayed with axes measuring time and action evokes the static nature of the game more than words ever can The wood says what words cannot In this vision the very idea of language as the basis of a humane education even of human identity seems to give way to a post or pre verbal discourse of pictures and objects <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> humanities becomes another name for the obsequies of humanism But it would be unfair to generalize from the obviously anti humanistic manifestations of digital humanities to the entirety of the field itself for the simple reason that the field has no common essence it is not a species but at best a genus comprising a wide range of activities that have little relationship with one another At its most pragmatic digital humanities has less to do with ways of thinking than with problems of university administration The advent of the Internet has posed challenges to the institutions of academia just as it has to the music business and one function of digital humanities is to address these issues In What Is <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> and What s It Doing in English Departments <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> writes the construction of digital humanities increasingly serves to focus the anxiety and even outrage of individual scholars over their own lack of agency amid the turmoil in their institutions and professions <PERSON>McGann</PERSON> in his essay <ORGANIZATION>Information Technology</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Troubled Humanities</ORGANIZATION> points to university press publishing as one site of this discontent In 1990 a university press would typically print 1000 1500 copies of an academic book Today the number is 200 250 and dropping every year The obvious solution is to migrate the publication of monographs to the Internet but the incentives for promotion and tenure continue to reward print publication over online work How to bring about the transition to online publication is the 64 000 question <PERSON>McGann</PERSON> observes Other essays in Debates in the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities and Defining Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> raise the problem of how to assign credit for things such as websites and computer programs which are collaboratively authored in a system geared to the single author article or book Others lament that there is no budget line in most departments for the kind of specialists programmers curators librarians needed to make a digital humanities project come together Underlying these administrative problems is a more basic question about the nature of humanistic work A humanities culture that prizes thinking and writing will tend to look down on making and building as banausic the kind of labor that can be outsourced to non specialists <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> humanities gains some of its self confidence from the democratic challenge that it mounts to that old distinction Personally I think <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> is about building things said <PERSON>Ramsay</PERSON> in a polarizing talk at the <ORGANIZATION>MLA</ORGANIZATION> convention in 2011 printed in Defining Digital Humanities Unlike many theorists however he was willing to make this demand concrete Do you have to know how to code I m a tenured professor of digital humanities and I say yes Naturally most humanities professors even digital ones do not know how to code and <PERSON>Ramsay</PERSON> s bluntness caused a backlash boy did this get me in trouble he writes in a note to his essay There is something admirable about this frankness if digital humanities is to be a distinctive discipline it should require distinctive skills But are they humanistic skills Was it necessary for a humanist in the past five hundred years to know how to set type and publish a book Moreover is it practical for a humanities curriculum that can already stretch for ten years or more from freshman year to Ph D to be expanded to include programming skills Not to mention the possibility that the kind of people who are drawn to English and art history may not be interested in or good at computer programming Like many questions in digital humanities this one remains open But the basic emphasis on teamwork and building as opposed to solitary intellection is common to all stripes of digital humanists Digital_Humanities leaves no doubt that the future of the field belongs to democratic groups not elitist individuals The myth of the humanities as the terrain of the solitary genius laboring alone on a creative work which when completed would be remarkable for its singularity a philosophical text a definitive historical study a paradigm shifting work of literary criticism is of course a myth Genius does exist but knowledge has always been produced and accessed in ways that are fundamentally distributed although today this is more true than ever Once again the of course signals that we are in the realm of ideology As an empirical matter the solitary scholar laboring on a singular paradigm shifting work is quite real Mimesis is not a myth and neither is Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism or Philosophy in a New Key or The Civilization of the Renaissance in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> you can go to the library and check them out or if that takes too long download them There is no contradiction between this fact and the idea that knowledge is fundamentally distributed Scholarship is always a conversation and every scholar needs books to write books Humanistic scholarship has always been additive and collaborative even if it has not been in the strict sense collective It is not immediately clear why things should change just because the book is read on a screen rather than a page This is not to say of course that traditional scholars even solitary geniuses cannot make use of digital tools They already do just about every scholarly book written today is written on a computer and every query takes the form of an e mail and some advanced scholarly methods rely on exciting new technological tools The translation of books into digital files accessible on the Internet around the world can be seen as just another practical tool like these which facilitates but does not change the actual humanistic work of thinking and writing Indeed as <PERSON>McGann</PERSON> argues in his new essay collection A <LOCATION>New Republic</LOCATION> of Letters the translation of the world s libraries into digital form represents a major opportunity for a revival of philology the most traditional kind of textual scholarship So far he points out we are not even close to developing browser interfaces to compare with the interfaces that have evolved in the past 500 years of print technology If some digital humanists do see a contradiction between individual genius and digital practice it is because more is at stake here than whether you read on the page or online For the authors of Digital_Humanities it is a truism that a change in the medium of knowledge means a change in the structure and even the essence of knowledge Inspired by a na ve kind of historical materialism they take for granted that the kind of knowledge available to the reader of a scroll is different from that of a codex which is different from that of a printed book which is different from that of a screen That is why digital humanists imagine the past and the future in ways that fundamentally transform the authoring practices of poets and historians using new sets of tools technologies and design strategies For digital humanists authorship is rooted in the processes of design and the creation of the experiential the social and the communal None of these assumptions are obviously correct And all this is perhaps to state things the wrong way around it is not that digital humanists have created their tools out of a commitment to the social but that the tools of digital humanities are only suited to understanding things in the mass <PERSON>Franco Moretti</PERSON> the pioneering scholar of the history of the novel gives a name to the kind of encounter with texts that machines facilitate distant reading he calls it The New Critics gave us close reading the engagement with the minute verbal nuances of a text and the mode still thrives <PERSON>Helen Vendler</PERSON> s studies of <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> s sonnets and <PERSON>Dickinson</PERSON> s poems are classic contemporary examples But as <PERSON>Moretti</PERSON> argues in Conjectures on World Literature one of the essays in his new collection Distant Reading close reading implies that certain texts are especially worthy of this kind of scrutiny that is it implies a canon If you want to look beyond the canon close reading will not do it he observes you can closely read two hundred poems but not twenty thousand poems To analyze such a large quantity of texts you need to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text devices themes tropes or genres and systems And this is the kind of concrete pattern finding that computers specialize in Distant reading is reading like a computer not like a human being as <PERSON>Moretti</PERSON> forthrightly says We know how to read texts now let s learn how not to read them <PERSON>Moretti</PERSON> gives an example of this kind of not reading in an essay revealingly titled Style Inc Reflections on 7 000 Titles Rather than read every novel published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> between 1740 and 1850 a task that would fill a lifetime he takes only the titles of all those novels and uses a computer program to find patterns in the data One such pattern emerges right away over the period in question the average length of a title decreases dramatically from fifteen to twenty words at the beginning to six words at the end This is owed especially to the disappearance of very long titles which were conventional in early novels but became unfashionable By examining those long titles <PERSON>Moretti</PERSON> shows that what changed was the function of the title itself From a miniature summary of the book it evolved into a catchy attention grabbing advertisement for the book The proliferation of novels in a crowded market helps to explain this trend Titles allow us to see a larger literary field and the first thing we see in this larger field is the force of the market <PERSON>Moretti</PERSON> goes on to draw other salient observations from the data for instance why the titles of sensationalistic novels tend to begin with the The Vampyre The Pirate The Rebel while pioneering feminist novels opt for a A Hard Woman A Daughter of Today As he explains What the article says is that we are encountering all these figures for the first time we think we know what daughters and wives are but we actually don t and must understand them afresh <ORGANIZATION>Style Inc</ORGANIZATION> presents as good a case for the usefulness of digital tools in the humanities as one can find in any of these new books And yet its findings are not very exciting It is striking that digital tools no matter how powerful are themselves incapable of generating significant new ideas about the subject matter of humanistic study They aggregate data and they reveal patterns in the data but to know what kinds of questions to ask about the data and its patterns requires a reader who is already well versed in literature The computer can tell you that titles have shrunk and you hardly need a computer to tell you that the bulky eighteenth century title is commonplace and a target of jokes even today but it takes a scholar with a broad knowledge of literary history that is a scholar who has examined the insides and not just the outsides of literary and artistic works to speculate about the reasons titles shrink and why it matters Likewise you have to know about the nuances of the English language and the history of feminism in order to be able to explain why titles such as A Hard Woman appealed to the writers of new woman novels Is a computerized list of titles necessary to generate such an insight or could it be deduced simply by reading and thinking about some of the relevant books Does the digital component of digital humanities give us new ways to think or only ways to illustrate what we already know Certainly if we ask the data unsophisticated or banal questions we will get only unsophisticated and banal answers That is the lesson of Uncharted in which <PERSON>Erez Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Baptiste Michel</PERSON> play tricks with the <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> Ngram Viewer In an odd but revealing moment they quote a list of things that publications said about their invention when it launched including this Mother <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> hailed it as perhaps the greatest timewaster in the history of the Internet Hailed does not seem like quite the right word here but <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel don</PERSON> t care what matters is not the quality of the attention but the fact that the interwebs were atwitter and the Twitter was abuzz The Google Ngram Viewer allows the user to search all of <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> Books for strings of characters This sounds like a powerful tool but as <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> put it through its paces it turns out once again that the digital analysis of literature tells us what we already know rather than leading us in new directions It is not surprising to learn for instance that the incidence in print of the name of any given year is most common in that year itself so that more books containing 1950 were published in 1950 than in any other year One reason this is not surprising is that all books copyright pages include the year of publication but <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> ignore this fact which tends to nullify their conclusions about the forgetting curve Once again meta knowledge knowledge about the conditions of the data you are manipulating proves to be crucial for understanding anything a computer tells you Ask a badly phrased question and you get a meaningless answer At another point <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> use the Ngram Viewer to document the suppression of certain names in German language books published between 1933 and 1945 They show that banned artists such as <PERSON>Chagall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Beckmann</PERSON> virtually disappear from German books under the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> and then rebound spectacularly after the war as interest in their work revives This is another example of data illustrating a truism rather than discovering a truth After all we wouldn t think to search for those names in that time period unless we knew what we were going to find and why and the same holds true for the other examples of censorship that <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> cite the word Tiananmen in Chinese after 1989 for instance The faux na vet of some of these digital tools their proud innocence of prior historical knowledge and literary interpretation is partly responsible for the thinness of their findings Indeed <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> write that when they posed the same question about artists names to a scholar from <ORGANIZATION>Yad Vashem</ORGANIZATION> she was able to predict exactly which names would appear at which end of the curve We didn t give her access to our data or to our results and we didn t even tell her why we were asking All she got from us was the list of names Nevertheless her answers agreed with ours the vast majority of the time Of course they did she was a scholar <PERSON>Aiden</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> do not seem to recognize that this example far from making the case for the usefulness of Ngrams completely destroys it by turning them into fancy reiterations of conventional wisdom If computers cannot think better than human beings digital humanists are left with the argument that at least they can think faster the <PERSON>John Henry</PERSON> argument In the essay Developing Things Notes toward an Epistemology of Building in the Humanities Ramsay and <PERSON>Geoffrey Rockwell</PERSON> observe Reading <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> and applying his theoretical framework can takes months or years of application A web based text analysis tool could apply its theoretical position in seconds Never mind that understanding that theoretical position will take more than seconds Here are nicely encapsulated the two fundamental errors that theorizing about the revolutionary nature of digital humanities often commits First there is the idea that thinking humanistically is a matter of taking a framework of ideas and applying it to a text or a work of art The second is the idea that applying ideas in this way leads to an external self subsistent result be it a theory or another book or a piece of driftwood with pictures on it Both of these errors derive from a false analogy between the humanities and the sciences Humanistic thinking does not proceed by experiments that yield results it is a matter of mental experiences provoked by works of art and history that expand the range of one s understanding and sympathy It makes no sense to accelerate the work of thinking by delegating it to a computer when it is precisely the experience of thought that constitutes the substance of a humanistic education The humanities cannot take place in seconds This is why the best humanistic scholarship is creative more akin to poetry and fiction than to chemistry or physics it draws not just on a body of knowledge though knowledge is indispensable but on a scholar s imagination and sense of reality Of course this work cannot be done in isolation any more than a poem can be written in a private language But just as writing a poem with a computer is no easier than writing one with a pen so no computer can take on the human part of humanistic work which is to feel and to think one s way into different times places and minds The problem for the humanities the institutional and budgetary problem is that changed minds and expanded spirits are not the kinds of things that can be tabulated on bureaucratic reports In humanistic study quantification hits its limits even if quantifiers refuse to recognize them It is much easier to measure the means books published citations accumulated than the ends It is likely that digital humanities will only increase this kind of pressure on humanities departments All those grants have to be accounted for somehow the rhetoric of the digital in the academy as in the marketplace prides itself on being results oriented Thus the authors of Digital_Humanities conclude If the humanities are to thrive and not just exist in niches of privilege they will have to visibly demonstrate the contributions to knowledge and society they are making in the digital era Here the populist language of ivory towers combines with the market language of productivity to create yet another menacing metric for the humanities The best thing that the humanities could do at this moment then is not to embrace the momentum of the digital the tech tsunami but to resist it and to critique it This is not Luddism it is intellectual responsibility Is it actually true that reading online is an adequate substitute for reading on paper If not perhaps we should not be concentrating on digitizing our books but on preserving and circulating them more effectively Are images able to do the work of a complex discourse If not and reasoning is irreducibly linguistic then it would be a grave mistake to move writing away from the center of a humanities education These are the kinds of questions that humanists ought to be well equipped to answer Indeed they are just the newest forms of questions that they have been asking since the Industrial Revolution began to make our tools our masters The posture of skepticism is a wearisome one for the humanities now perhaps more than ever when technology is so confident and culture is so self suspicious It is no wonder that some humanists are tempted to throw off the traditional burden and infuse the humanities with the material resources and the militant confidence of the digital The danger is that they will wake up one morning to find that they have sold their birthright for a mess of apps
