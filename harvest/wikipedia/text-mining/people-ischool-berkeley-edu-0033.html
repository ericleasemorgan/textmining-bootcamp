<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>
<P>
The possibilities for data mining from large text collections are
virtually untapped.  Text expresses a vast, rich range of information,
but encodes this information in a form that is difficult to decipher
automatically.  Perhaps for this reason, there has been little work in
text data mining to date, and most people who have talked about it
have either conflated it with information access or have not made use
of text directly to discover heretofore unknown information.

<P>
In this paper I will first define data mining, information access, and
corpus-based computational linguistics, and then discuss the
relationship of these to text data mining.  The intent behind these
contrasts is to draw attention to exciting new kinds of problems for
computational linguists.  I describe examples of what I consider to be
real text data mining efforts and briefly outline our recent ideas
about how to pursue exploratory data analysis over text.

<h2><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</h2>

<P>
The nascent field of text data mining (TDM) has the peculiar
distinction of having a name and a fair amount of hype but as yet
almost no practitioners.  I suspect this has happened because people
assume TDM is a natural extension of the slightly less nascent field
of data mining (DM), also known as knowledge discovery in databases
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#fayyad96b">Fayyad and Uthurusamy1999</A>], and information archeology [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#brachman93">Brachman  et al.1993</A>].
Additionally, there are some disagreements about what actually
constitutes data mining.  It turns out that ``mining'' is not a very
good metaphor for what people in the field actually do.  Mining
implies extracting precious nuggets of ore from otherwise worthless
rock.  If data mining really followed this metaphor, it would mean
that people were discovering new factoids within their
inventory databases.  However, in practice this is not really the
case.  Instead, data mining applications tend to be (semi)automated
discovery of trends and patterns across very large datasets, usually
for the purposes of decision making [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#fayyad96b">Fayyad and Uthurusamy1999</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#fayyad97">Fayyad1997</A>].  Part
of what I wish to argue here is that in the case of text, it can be
interesting to take the mining-for-nuggets metaphor seriously.

<P>

<h2><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
TDM vs. Information Access</A>
</h2>

<P>
It is important to differentiate between text data mining and
information access (or information retrieval, as it is more widely
known).

<P>
The goal of information access is to help users find documents that
satisfy their information needs [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#baeza99">Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto1999</A>].  The standard
procedure is akin to looking for needles in a needlestack - the
problem isn't so much that the desired information is not known, but
rather that the desired information coexists with many other valid
pieces of information.  Just because a user is currently interested in
NAFTA and not Furbies does not mean that all descriptions of Furbies
are worthless.  The problem is one of homing in on what is currently
of interest to the user.

<P>
As noted above, the goal of data mining is to discover or derive new
information from data, finding patterns across datasets, and/or
separating signal from noise.  The fact that an information retrieval
system can return a document that contains the information a user
requested does not imply that a new discovery has been made: the information
had to have already been known to the author of the text; otherwise the
author could not have written it down.

<P>
I have observed that many people, when asked about text data
mining, assume it should have something to do with ``making things
easier to find on the web''.  For example, the description of the
KDD-97 panel on Data Mining and the Web stated:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
... Two challenges are predominant for data mining on the Web. The first
goal is to help users in finding useful information on the Web and in
discovering knowledge about a domain that is represented by a
collection of Web-documents. The second goal is to analyse the
transactions run in a Web-based system, be it to optimize the system
or to find information about the clients using the 
system.<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#foot16"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This search-centric view misses the point that we might actually want
to treat the information in the web as a large knowledge base from
which we can extract new, never-before encountered information
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#craven98">Craven  et al.1998</A>].

<P>
On the other hand, the results of certain types of text processing can yield
<I>tools</I> that indirectly <I>aid</I> in the information access
process.  Examples include  text clustering to
create thematic overviews of text collections
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#cutting92">Cutting  et al.1992</A>,<A

 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#kleinberg98">Kleinberg1998</A>].

<P>
Aside from providing tools to aid in the standard information access process,
I think text data mining can contribute along another dimension.  In
future I hope to see information access systems supplemented with
tools for exploratory data analysis.  Our
efforts in this direction are embodied in the LINDI project, described
in Section <A HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#eda">5</A> below.

<h2><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
TDM and Computational Linguistics</A>
</h2>

<P>
If we extrapolate from data mining (as practiced) on numerical data to
data mining from text collections, we discover that there already
exists a field engaged in text data mining: corpus-based computational
linguistics!  Empirical computational linguistics computes statistics
over large text collections in order to discover useful patterns.
These patterns are used to inform algorithms for various subproblems
within natural language processing, such as part-of-speech tagging,
word sense disambiguation, and bilingual dictionary creation
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#armstrong94">Armstrong1994</A>].

<P>
It is certainly of interest to a computational linguist that the words
``prices, prescription, and patent'' are highly likely to co-occur
with the medical sense of ``drug'' while ``abuse, paraphernalia, and
illicit'' are likely to co-occur with the illegal drug sense of this
word [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#church91c">Church and Liberman1991</A>].  However, the kinds of patterns found and used
in computational linguistics are not likely to be what the general
business community hopes for when they use the term text data mining.

<P>
Within the computational linguistics framework, efforts in automatic
augmentation of existing lexical structures seem to fit the 
data-mining-as-ore-extraction metaphor.  Examples include automatic
augmentation of WordNet relations [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#fellbaum98">Fellbaum1998</A>] by identifying
lexico-syntactic patterns that unambiguously indicate those relations
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#hearst98b">Hearst1998</A>], and automatic acquisition of subcategorization data
from large text corpora [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#manning93">Manning1993</A>].  However, these serve the
specific needs of computational linguistics and are not applicable to
a broader audience.

<P>

<h2><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
TDM and Category Metadata</A>
</h2>

<P>
Some researchers have claimed that text categorization should be
considered text data mining.  Although analogies can be found in the
data mining literature (e.g., referring to classification of
astronomical phenomena as data mining [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#fayyad96b">Fayyad and Uthurusamy1999</A>]), I believe
when applied to text categorization this is a misnomer.  Text
categorization is a boiling down of the specific content of a document
into one (or more) of a set of pre-defined labels.  This does not lead
to discovery of new information; presumably the person who wrote the
document knew what it was about.  Rather, it produces a compact
summary of something that is already known.

<P>
However, there are two recent areas of inquiry that make use of text
categorization and do seem to fit within the conceptual framework of
discovery of trends and patterns within textual data for more general
purpose usage.

<P>
One body of work uses text category labels (associated with Reuters
newswire) to find ``unexpected patterns'' among text articles
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#feldman95">Feldman and Dagan1995</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#dagan96">Dagan  et al.1996</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#feldman97a">Feldman  et al.1997</A>].  The main approach is to compare
distributions of category assignments within subsets of the document
collection.  For instance, distributions of commodities in country C1
are compared against those of country C2 to see if interesting or
unexpected trends can be found.  Extending this idea, one country's
export trends might be compared against those of a set of countries
that are seen as an economic unit (such as the G-7). 

<P>
Another effort is that of the DARPA Topic Detection and Tracking
initiative [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#allan98">Allan  et al.1998</A>].  While several of the tasks within this
initiative are standard text analysis problems (such as categorization
and segmentation), there is an interesting task called On-line New
Event Detection, whose input is a stream of news stories in
chronological order, and whose output is a yes/no decision for each
story, made at the time the story arrives, indicating whether the
story is the first reference to a newly occurring event.  In other
words, the system must detect the first instance of what will become a
series of reports on some important topic.  Although this can be
viewed as a standard classification task (where the class is a binary
assignment to the new-event class) it is more in the spirit of data
mining, in that the focus is on discovery of the beginning of a new
theme or trend.

<P>
The reason I consider this examples - using multiple occurrences of
text categories to detect trends or patterns - to be ``real'' data
mining is that they use text metadata to tell us something about the
world, outside of the text collection itself.  (However, since these
applications use metadata associated with text documents, rather than
the text directly, it is unclear if it should be considered text data
mining or standard data mining.)  The computational linguistics
applications tell us about how to improve language analysis, but they
do not discover more widely usable information.

Text Data Mining as Exploratory Data Analysis
</h2>

<P>
Another way to view text data mining is as a process of exploratory
data analysis [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#tukey77">Tukey1977</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#hoaglin83">Hoaglin  et al.1983</A>] that leads to the discovery of
heretofore unknown information, or to answers to questions for which
the answer is not currently known.

<P>
Of course, it can be argued that the standard practice of reading
textbooks, journal articles and other documents helps researchers in
the discovery of new information, since this is an integral part of
the research process. However, the idea here is to use text for discovery in
a more direct manner.  Two examples are described below.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
Using Text to Form Hypotheses about Disease</A>
</H2>

<P>
For more than a decade, Don Swanson has eloquently argued why it is
plausible to expect new information to be derivable from text
collections: experts can only read a small subset of what is published
in their fields and are often unaware of developments in related
fields. Thus it should be possible to find useful linkages between
information in related literatures, if the authors of those
literatures rarely refer to one another's work.  Swanson has shown how
chains of causal implication within the medical literature can lead to
hypotheses for causes of rare diseases, some of which have received
supporting experimental evidence
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#swanson87">Swanson1987</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#swanson91">Swanson1991</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#swanson94">Swanson and Smalheiser1994</A>,<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#swanson97">Swanson and Smalheiser1997</A>].

<P>
For example, when investigating causes of migraine headaches, he
extracted various pieces of evidence from titles of articles in
the biomedical literature.  Some of these clues can be paraphrased
as follows:

<P>
<UL><LI>stress is associated with migraines
<LI>stress can lead to loss of magnesium
<LI>calcium channel blockers prevent some migraines
<LI>magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker
<LI>spreading cortical depression (SCD) is implicated in some
migraines
<LI>high leveles of magnesium inhibit SCD
<LI>migraine patients have high platelet aggregability
<LI>magnesium can suppress platelet aggregability
</UL>
<P>
These clues suggest that magnesium deficiency may play a role in some
kinds of migraine headache; a hypothesis which did not exist in the
literature at the time Swanson found these links.  The hypothesis has
to be tested via non-textual means, but the important point is that a new,
potentially plausible medical hypothesis was derived from a
combination of text fragments and the explorer's medical expertise.
(According to swanson91, subsequent study found support for
the magnesium-migraine hypothesis [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#ramadan89">Ramadan  et al.1989</A>].)

<P>
This approach has been only partially automated.  There is, of course,
a potential for combinatorial explosion of potentially valid links.
beeferman98 has developed a flexible interface and analysis
tool for exploring certain kinds of chains of links among lexical
relations within WordNet.<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#foot58"><SUP>2</SUP></A> However, sophisticated new
algorithms are needed for helping in the pruning process, since a good
pruning algorithm will want to take into account various kinds of
semantic constraints.  This may be an interesting area of
investigation for computational linguists.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
Using Text to Uncover Social Impact</A>
</H2>

<P>
Switching to an entirely different domain, consider a recent effort to
determine the effects of publicly financed research on industrial
advances [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#narin97">Narin  et al.1997</A>].  After years of preliminary studies and
building special purpose tools, the authors found that the technology
industry relies more heavily than ever on government-sponsored
research results.  The authors explored relationships
among patent text and the published research literature, using a
procedure which was reported as follows in broad97:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The CHI Research team examined the science references on the front
pages of American patents in two recent periods - 1987 and 1988, as
well as 1993 and 1994 - looking at all the 397,660 patents issued.
 
   It found 242,000 identifiable science references and zeroed in on
those published in the preceding 11 years, which turned out to be 80
percent of them.  Searches of computer databases allowed the linking
of 109,000 of these references to known journals and authors'
addresses. After eliminating redundant citations to the same paper, as
well as articles with no known American author, the study had a core
collection of 45,000 papers. Armies of aides then fanned out to
libraries to look up the papers and examine their closing lines, which
often say who financed the research.  That detective work revealed an
extensive reliance on publicly financed science.

<P>...
   Further narrowing its focus, the study set aside patents given to
schools and governments and zeroed in on those awarded to industry.
For 2,841 patents issued in 1993 and 1994, it examined the peak year
of literature references, 1988, and found 5,217 citations to science
papers.

<P>
Of these, it found that 73.3 percent had been written at public
institutions - universities, government labs and other public
agencies, both in the United States and abroad.

Thus a heterogeneous mix of 
operations was required to conduct a complex analyses
over large text collections.  These operations included:

<!-- MATH: \begin{itemize}

</ul>

<P>
Because all the data was not available online, much of the work had to
be done by hand, and special purpose tools were required
to perform the operations. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">
The LINDI Project</A>
</H2>

<P>
The objectives of the LINDI project<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#foot67"><SUP>3</SUP></A> are to investigate how
researchers can use large text collections in the discovery of new
important information, and to build software systems to help support
this process.  The main tools for discovering new information are of
two types: support for issuing sequences of queries and related
operations across text collections, and tightly coupled statistical
and visualization tools for the examination of associations among
concepts that co-occur within the retrieved documents.  Both sets of
tools make use of attributes associated specifically with text
collections and their metadata.  Thus the broadening, narrowing, and
linking of relations seen in the patent example should be tightly
integrated with analysis and interpretation tools as needed in the
biomedical example.

<P>
Following amant96, the interaction paradigm is that of a
mixed-initiative balance of control between user and system.  The
interaction is a cycle in which the system suggests hypotheses and
strategies for investigating these hypotheses, and the user either
uses or ignores these suggestions and decides on the next move.

<P>
We are interested in an important problem in molecular
biology, that of automating the discovery of the function of newly
sequenced genes [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#mikewalker98">Walker  et al.1998</A>].  Human genome researchers perform
experiments in which they analyze co-expression of tens of thousands
of novel and known genes simultaneously.<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#foot70"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
Given this huge collection of genetic information, the goal is to
determine which of the novel genes are medically interesting, meaning
that they are co-expressed with already understood genes which are
known to be involved in disease.  Our strategy is to explore the
biomedical literature, trying to formulate plausible
hypotheses about which genes are of interest.

<P>
Most information access systems require the user to execute and keep
track of tactical moves, often distracting from the thought-intensive
aspects of the problem [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#bates90">Bates1990</A>].  The LINDI interface provides a
facility for users to build and so reuse sequences of query operations
via a drag-and-drop interface.  These allow the user to repeat the
same sequence of actions for different queries.  In the gene example,
this allows the user to specify a sequence of operations to apply to
one co-expressed gene, and then iterate this sequence over a list of
other co-expressed genes that can be dragged onto the template.  (The
Visage interface [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#derthick97">Derthick  et al.1997</A>] implements this kind of
functionality within its information-centric framework.)  These
include the following operations (see 
<A HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#fig">Figure 1</A>):

<P>
<UL><P>
<LI>Iteration of an operation over the items within a set.  (This
allows each item retrieved in a previous query to be use as a search
terms for a new query.)

<P>
<LI>Transformation, i.e., applying an operation to an item and
returning a transformed item (such as extracting a feature).

<P>
<LI>Ranking, i.e., applying an operation to a set of items and
returning a (possibly) reordered set of items with the same
cardinality.

<P>
<LI>Selection, i.e., applying an operation to a set of items and
returning a (possibly) reordered set of items with the same or smaller
cardinality.

<P>
<LI>Reduction, i.e., applying an operation to one or more sets of
items to yield a singleton result (e.g., to compute percentages and
averages).

<P>
</UL>
<P>
This system will allow maintenance of several different types of
history including history of commands issued, history of strategies
employed, and history of hypotheses tested.  For the history view, we
plan to use a ``spreadsheet'' layout [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#hendry97">Hendry and Harper1997</A>] as well as a
variation on a ``slide sorter'' view which Visage uses for
presentation creation but not for history retention [<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#roth97">Roth  et al.1997</A>].

<P>
Since gene function discovery is a new area, there is not 
yet a known set of exploration strategies.  So initially the system
must help an expert user generate and record good exploration strategies.
The user interface provides a mechanism for recording and
modifying sequences of actions.  These include facilities that
refer to metadata structure, allowing, for example, query terms to be
expanded by terms one level above or below them in a subject
hierarchy.  Once a successful set of strategies has been devised, they
can be re-used by other researchers and (with luck) by an automated
version of the system.  The intent is to build up enough strategies
that the system will begin to be used as an assistant or advisor
[<A
 HREF="people-ischool-berkeley-edu-0033.htm#amant96">Amant1996</A>], ranking hypotheses according to projected importance
and plausibility. 

<P>
Thus the emphasis of this system is to help automate the tedious parts
of the text manipulation process and to integrate underlying 
computationally-driven text analysis with human-guided decision making
within exploratory data analysis over text.

A hypothetical sequence of operations for the exploration of gene
function within a biomedical text collection, where the functions of
genes A, B, and C are known, and commonalities are sought to
hypothesize the function of the unknown gene.  The mapping operation
imposes a rank ordering on the selected keywords.  The final operation
is a selection of only those documents that contain at least one of
the top-ranked keywords and that contain mentions of all three known
genes.

Summary</A>
</h2>

<P>
For almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed
large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce
better text analysis algorithms.  In this paper, I have attempted to
suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to
discover new facts and trends about the world itself.  I suggest that
to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text
analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided
analysis may open the door to exciting new results.

Raman contributed to the design and did all the implementation of the
first LINDI prototype.
