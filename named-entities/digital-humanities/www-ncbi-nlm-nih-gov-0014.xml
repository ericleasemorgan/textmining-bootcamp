Laegreid A <PERSON>Komorowski</PERSON> J Hovig E Author information 1 <ORGANIZATION>Department of Computer and Information Science Norwegian University of Science and Technology Trondheim Norway</ORGANIZATION> Abstract We have carried out automated extraction of explicit and implicit biomedical knowledge from publicly available gene and text databases to create a gene to gene co citation network for 13 712 named human genes by automated analysis of titles and abstracts in over 10 million <ORGANIZATION>MEDLINE</ORGANIZATION> records The associations between genes have been annotated by linking genes to terms from the medical subject heading MeSH index and terms from the gene ontology GO database The extracted database and accompanying web tools for gene expression analysis have collectively been named PubGene We validated the extracted networks by three large scale experiments showing that co occurrence reflects biologically meaningful relationships thus providing an approach to extract and structure known biology We validated the applicability of the tools by analyzing two publicly available microarray data sets Comment in Linking microarray data to
