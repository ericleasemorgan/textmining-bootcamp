                <p> This paper traces the little-known history of the <cite class="title italic">London
                        Stage Information Bank</cite>, a digital initiative that ran from 1970 to
                    1978 under the direction of Professor Ben R. Schneider, Jr. at Lawrence
                    University. With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the
                    American Council of Learned Societies, and the Mellon Foundation, Schneider’s
                    team produced a database from the multi-volume reference work <cite class="title italic">The London Stage 1660-1800</cite> (Southern Illinois
                    University Press, 1960-68). Today, however, most of the project’s outputs are
                    lost or damaged, and its history has been largely forgotten in both theater
                    studies and eighteenth-century studies. This essay traces the history of the
                    Information Bank and my efforts to recover its damaged data and code, offering
                    the project as an object lesson in questions of access, preservation, and
                    institutional memory that digital humanities practitioners continue to confront
                    in 2017. I argue that the project faded into obscurity, not only because of
                    technological obsolescence, but also because the development team was unable to
                    promote the kinds of research questions and behaviors that would enable their
                    tool's widespread adoption and survival. The indifference of literary and
                    theater scholars to the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> throughout
                    the late 1970s and early 1980s demonstrates how vital it is that digital and
                    computational humanities work articulate its meaningfulness within existing
                    intellectual and disciplinary traditions. While digital scholars build new
                    avenues for inquiry that expand and transform humanities research, the survival
                    of these approaches depends on their relationship to current humanities
                    questions, methods, commitments, and epistemologies.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The year is 1970. Scholars of British theater are celebrating the recent publication
                of <cite class="title italic">The London Stage, 1660-1800</cite>, an 11-book, 8000-page
                calendar of theatrical performances in London over a 140-year period. After more
                than a decade conducting the archival and editorial work necessary to produce this
                reference work, the advisory board seeks outside help constructing an index, which
                they hope will allow researchers to cross-reference information about a given play
                title or actor across volumes. The theater scholar they choose for the job, a
                dabbler in the new field of humanities computing, is confident that a program can
                perform this task better than a person. He assembles an international team of
                humanities scholars, technologists, and students, garners hundreds of thousands of
                dollars in private and federal funding, and spends the better part of a decade
                producing a database and a suite of tools for accessing and manipulating it. In the
                end, however, his team’s work is lost to technological obsolescence, as well as to
                the indifference of a scholarly community unconvinced of the need for such digital
                and computational approaches to humanities research. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This is the story of the <cite class="title italic">London Stage Information Bank</cite>,
                an early humanities computing project that presents irresistible parallels to many
                issues facing digital humanities today. The project ran from 1970 to 1978 under the
                direction of Professor Ben Ross Schneider, Jr. at Lawrence University in Appleton,
                Wisconsin, and it was enabled by grants from the National Endowment for the
                Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Mellon Foundation, and
                other major funders. Today, however, most of the project’s outputs are lost or
                damaged, its history largely forgotten. This essay presents a study of the archival
                record and material artifacts of this project, positioning the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> as an object lesson in issues of access, preservation,
                and institutional memory that digital scholars continue to confront in 2017. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">More than a mere cautionary tale about data loss, however, the history of the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> illuminates the need for researchers to
                articulate the relationship of digital research methods to existing intellectual and
                disciplinary traditions. I will argue that the project faded into obscurity, not
                only because it was ahead of its time or because the rapid advancement of computing
                technology took the team by surprise, but also because Schneider made key
                assumptions about the intellectual dispositions of his user base. Proceeding from
                those assumptions, his team did not promote the kinds of research practices that
                would ensure their tool’s widespread adoption and survival. Their presentations and
                publications exhibited the capabilities of the database but largely assumed that its
                usefulness would be self-evident–a tendency that continues today in many demoes of
                digital humananities datasets and tools. While digital scholars can and should build
                new avenues for inquiry that expand and transform humanities research, the survival
                of these approaches depends on their relationship to current humanities questions,
                methods, commitments, and epistemologies. Digital humanities practitioners must
                model the modes of inquiry our work enables and demonstrate that these modes allow
                us to produce new, exciting knowledge that is legible to humanists who do not
                identify as digital scholars.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">This essay first presents a history of the <cite class="title italic">London Stage
                    Information Bank</cite> and my ongoing effort to recover it, then synthesizes
                the lessons that can be learned from the project and suggests future applications of
                those lessons. In doing so, it contributes to the growing body of work that
                recognizes the importance of a reciprocal exchange of perspectives between theater
                and performance studies and digital humanities. As Debra Caplan has recently pointed
                out, the historical lack of interaction between the two communities has led to
                serious issues of accessibility and preservation in digital theater studies: “Without disciplinary-wide best practices for creating,
                        funding, disseminating, or reviewing digital humanities work, projects are
                        often idiosyncratic in the technologies and approaches they choose, and
                        projects are not always equally accessible”
                     [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#caplan2015">Caplan 2015</a>, 358–59]. At the same time, as Sarah Bay-Cheng has argued and as Caplan echoes,
                theater studies researchers also have much to offer to the digital humanities,
                particularly in their long tradition of attention to the ephemerality of
                interactions–a problem that is inherent both to performance history and to digital
                media and culture [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#baycheng2012">Bay-Cheng 2012</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e222">[1]</a> This interplay between ephemerality and durability,
                dramatized in the ability of a fleeting performance event to leave traces and create
                impacts that ripple out across time, resonates with recent media archaeological work
                within digital humanities. Jussi Parikka reminds us that digitally encoded
                information, often imagined in terms of its “immaterial virtuality,” is in fact
                dependent on “hardware, software, and other material contexts” that are
                    “prone to deterioration;” for Parikka, “[t]he digital is not eternal, nor is it simply
                        ephemeral”
                     [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#parikka2012">Parikka 2012</a>, 118–19]. Matthew Kirschenbaum similarly highlights the tension between the mutability
                and resilience of digital inscriptions on physical media in his book <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</cite>
                [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>], his emphasis often falling on the curious
                survival of seemingly evanescent digital texts.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e257">[2]</a> This is a tension that accords especially well
                with theater studies, where an interest in ephemerality must be balanced with an
                awareness of the mediated afterlife of performance. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In both theater studies and media archaeology, then, poststructuralist notions of the
                    “always already disappearing” object of study are confronted by a growing
                awareness of the stubborn material residue of those objects’ transmission [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#bloom2013">Bloom et al. 2013</a>, 167]. The <cite class="title italic">London Stage
                    Information Bank</cite> exemplifies this tension: it was lost to technological
                change, yet it survives in at least partially recoverable forms. Furthermore,
                notions of residue and resonance drive us to recognize not only how the material
                stuff of hardware, software, and data persist, but also how more abstract
                artifacts–data models, for instance, that reflect particular orientations toward the
                objects under consideration–are passed down and inherited from collection to
                collection, from tool to tool.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e279">[3]</a> My attempt to recover both
                the history and the material artifacts of this forgotten project illustrates the
                productive interplay between the theoretical orientations of theater history,
                performance studies, and media archaeological approaches within digital

                    Southern Illinois University Press between 1960 and 1968. These books contain
                    extensive information about nearly all recorded performances thought to have
                    taken place in London over the course of the long eighteenth century, based on
                    archival evidence held in libraries throughout the U.S. and the U.K. The volumes
                    are organized by theatrical season, with a typical entry representing a
                    performance at a specific theater on a specific evening. It usually gives the
                    date or approximate date of the performance, the title of the main play staged,
                    the cast list if known, and any other entertainments that accompanied the main
                    attraction. Some entries specify the amount of money that the theater made that
                    evening, mention prominent audience members, or detail the provenance of the
                    information in the entry (Figure 1).</div>

                        entry represents a performance at the Theatre Royal–Drury Lane
                            (“DL”) on Saturday, October 14, 1752. The main play
                        performed was <cite class="title italic">The Beggar’s Opera</cite>, a ballad
                        opera by John Gay that was popular throughout the century. The cast list is
                        provided, showing that, for example, the leading role of Macheath was played
                        by an actor named Beard. The description of the hornpipe and country dance
                        featured in this performance are assumed to come from the newspaper
                        advertisement or playbill on which this entry is based. <cite class="title italic">Queen Mab</cite> is the title of the afterpiece, a shorter
                        entertainment that would have been performed after the conclusion of <cite class="title italic">The Beggar’s Opera</cite>. “As 12
                        Oct”. indicates that a cast list is provided in the advertisement
                        but omitted here because it is identical to the one that appears in an entry
                        for a performance two days earlier. (See Note 8 for additional information

                    theater history, but it also has serious limitations. One major issue is that
                    its indices are volume-specific, making it difficult to trace particular actors
                    or play titles across decades. This obstacle has been partially redressed by the
                    recent release of searchable full-text scans of the reference books through
                    HathiTrust, but one must still perform a single keyword search on each of the
                    eleven books individually.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e342">[4]</a> Importantly, neither the reference books nor
                    their digitized counterparts can readily support complex queries that go beyond
                    indexing to describe relationships among objects and persons, a limitation that
                    has been recognized from the beginning. Schneider and his programmer partner,
                    Will Daland, detailed the books’ limited operability in 1971, in an article that
                    appeared in the journal <cite class="title italic">Computers and the
                        Humanities</cite>: “If, for example, one wished to determine how many times
                            actor X and actress Y performed in the same play together during their
                            careers, it might be necessary to scan a period of fifteen or twenty
                            years (possibly 800 to 1,000 pages) to exhaust all the possibilities of
                            intersection”

                    Schneider continued to try to establish an ongoing maintenance and preservation
                    plan for its various products. The underlying data for the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> was stored on tapes that Lawrence intended to host

                    nearby research institute. In 1980, approaching retirement, Schneider tried to
                    find a new home for the database where it would have ongoing technical support.
                    Unfortunately, no one wanted to host it–in part because the technology was
                    becoming gradually more obsolete, and in part because there had turned out to be

                    scholar-programmers to develop custom software and datasets from scratch rather
                    than consulting the past or the community for models and precedents; and the

                            much information about 18th century theatre; without computer help we
                            can’t see the forest for the trees.

                        London Stage</cite> could potentially raise and answer, Schneider’s <cite class="title italic">Information Bank </cite>garnered little attention from
                    eighteenth-century scholars. Five years after his optimistic assessment in
                        <cite class="title italic">Travels in Computerland</cite>, he wrote an essay for
                    an edited collection on <cite class="title italic">Data Bases in the Humanities and
                        Social Sciences</cite> lamenting the lack of interest. As the article
                    explains, the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> was publicized
                    widely to the research community as a search service; in the database’s first
                    three years of availability to the public, it was advertised in seven
                    newsletters sent to 1000 subscribers, as well as fourteen scholarly journals. In
                    that time Schneider received 126 requests for information, including 34 requests
                    for price quotes, but by 1979 not one researcher had followed through and paid
                    for the results of his or her queries [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#schneider1980">Schneider 1980</a>, 31–34].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">While Schneider states bitterly and with only minimal irony that “the failure
                        of the world to beat a path to my door is truly a mystery to me,” he does
                    offer a provisional explanation of his colleagues’ indifference to the new tool: <blockquote><p>
                        Most of the research that goes on in theatre history
                            today is precisely the kind of thing one can do just as well without the
                            computer. At the point where a good computer printout of the repertoires
                            of all the actors who played Shylock might reveal a great deal about the
                            staging of <cite class="title italic">The Merchant of Venice</cite>, it would
                            never occur to a writer on that subject (or to his reader) that the
                            question deserved further research in the form of a complete list of all
                            the roles of all the actors of Shylock. The kind of thing you can do now
                            by computer is not the kind of thing that anyone ever did, or felt the
                            need to do.

                    </p></blockquote> This assertion that the database can answer unprecedented, unintuitive
                    questions for humanities researchers is somewhat at odds with Schneider’s
                    earlier insistence that the database was of obvious relevance to current
                    scholarship. Indeed, the questions about generic trends, acting careers, and
                    theater finances that Schneider listed off in 1974 were relevant to theater
                    historians in the mid-twentieth century, and they remain relevant today; the
                    database altered the scope and speed of inquiry into these topics, but not
                    necessarily the range of possible queries. Yet by 1980, Schneider had also
                    identified a mismatch between the kinds of questions that interested scholars at
                    the time and the kinds of questions a computer could answer. For Schneider, the
                    fundamental issue was that his database was ahead of its time–and certainly, it
                    was an uphill battle to ask humanities researchers to think quantitatively or at
                    scale. Then as now, scholars of both literature and theater tended to focus a
                    given study on a limited number of texts or performances, sometimes even a
                    single work or writer. On the other hand, there is a way in which the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> could be seen in the 1980s as <cite class="title italic">behind</cite> the times. The potentially new possibilities
                    for inquiry that the database offered were simultaneously aligned with
                    old-fashioned forms of theater history characterized by the search for factual
                    information about past performances and by the urge to count them. In the early
                    decades of the “cultural turn,” applications of
                    poststructuralist theories represented the leading edge of humanities
                    research–and stood firmly against the arguably positivistic orientation of the
                        <cite class="title italic">Information Bank.</cite>

                    struggled to define itself simultaneously as part of an existing intellectual
                    tradition and as the next wave of scholarship, a balancing act that continues to
                    challenge digital humanities practitioners. The archive furthermore indicates
                    that Schneider and his team missed key opportunities to model the new kinds of
                    inquiry that the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> offered and to
                    articulate these techniques’ role within ongoing conversations in the field. The
                    climax of <cite class="title italic">Travels in Computerland</cite> revolves around
                    the last-minute rush to process queries for graduate student editors Leonard
                    Leff and Muriel Friedman to use in their presentations at the MLA 1971 annual
                    meeting in Chicago.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e595">[13]</a> These results, originally expected in late summer, were
                    delivered in mid-December, about two weeks before the conference. This lag
                    occurred because the technical side of the operation was focused on
                    error-correction while the research side wanted only good-enough data to produce
                    sample results as a proof of concept for fellow scholars [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#schneider1974">Schneider 1974</a>, 143, 202, 212–13]. The final narrative
                    chapter of <cite class="title italic">Travels</cite> ends with an unplanned
                    trans-Atlantic flight and an eleventh-hour triumph over programmatic errors,
                    leading to the successful production of the output needed for the MLA seminar;
                    unfortunately, help came too late, as Schneider is forced to admit in the
                    memoir’s postscript: <blockquote><p>
                        The reader may still be wondering how the seminar turned
                            out at the Modern Language Association….Well, although Muriel brought
                            her printout to the meeting, she did not treat it specifically, and
                            Leonard, not having time to study his, left it at home and gave a
                            theoretical discussion of the subject. Two months later I heard from a
                            scholar who’d been there that he’d gotten the distinct impression that
                            the project had fallen short of its goals.
                         [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#schneider1974">Schneider 1974</a>, 244]
                    </p></blockquote> The team was unable to demonstrate the kinds of results that could be
                    obtained from querying the new database and the ways that those results could
                    shed new light on current scholarly problems–such as, in Leff’s case, the
                    casting of Richard Brinsley Sheridan plays over time and the relationship of
                    anti-Irish sentiment to the casting of controversial roles [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#schneider1974">Schneider 1974</a>, 194–95]. Furthermore, this anecdote points to
                    the misfit between the London Stage Project’s outputs and the incentive
                    structures within which its personnel operated. The graduate student editors who
                    dedicated their time to the project were not able to translate that work into
                    concrete findings that could be used for their dissertations, an issue that the
                    scholarly community continues to work through today as we debate the best ways
                    to articulate the value of data curation and digital tool development for
                    hiring, promotion, and tenure–particularly when that labor leads to productive
                    failures rather than peer-reviewed products like articles and books. </div>

                    academics’ impulse to reinvent the wheel. While offering <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> queries at cost to researchers, Schneider also
                    offered his programs for purchase. Yet his 1980 essay indicates that there, too,
                    interest fell short of expectations. He found that new humanities computing
                    projects were unwilling to invest in prefabricated programs that could be
                    lightly tailored to their purposes: “For some reason, almost everyone would rather write
                            software from scratch than get it at a fraction of the cost ready-made,
                            thoroughly tested and debugged.…It does not seem to occur to scholars
                            embarked for the first time on computer projects that what they want to
                            do has ever been done before”
                         [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#schneider1980">Schneider 1980</a>, 33]. The unnecessary duplication of effort continues in the digital
                    humanities community today, as granting agencies have historically tended to
                    award projects that are building something new, rather than those that are
                    drawing on or sustaining existing resources. This funding situation creates
                    incentives to make new tools instead of adapting, maintaining, or updating ones
                    that have already been made. The result is the disappearance of many projects
                    that might otherwise form the foundation for subsequent work: Robin Camille
                    Davis has found that nearly half of the projects presented at the 2005 Digital
                    Humanities conference were no longer online a decade later [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#davis2015">Davis 2015</a>]. </div>

                        existing digital projects,” rather than only incentivizing the creation
                    of brand new ones. Likewise, the <a href="https://www.acls.org/programs/digitalextension/" onclick="window.open('https://www.acls.org/programs/digitalextension/'); return false" class="ref">ACLS Digital

                        projects and extending their reach to new communities of users,” rather
                    than providing startup funding for nascent projects. In addition, many digital
                    humanities research centers are beginning to take a tiered approach,
                    differentiating between researchers whose projects can be accomplished using
                    out-of-the-box solutions and those who truly need to build their projects from
                    the ground up. These signs point to a growing commitment to raise the survival
                    and adoption rates of digital humanities projects, ending the cycle of
                    reinvention and reduplication. </div>

                    humanities computing colleagues preferred to build their own software from the
                    ground up; he also learned that his products were considered obsolete, making
                    them increasingly difficult to market to those who might adopt or adapt them to
                    other purposes. In response to this growing threat, Schneider was defiant. The
                    Lawrence University archive houses a poignant 1976 letter in which Schneider
                    responds to a potential funder’s concerns about his technology being out of
                    date: <blockquote><p>Our system cannot become obsolete from advances in
                        hardware, because our programs are written in BASIC and PL/1, assiduously
                        supported by Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM, the two leading computer
                        manufacturers: there is no chance that either will build computers that are
                        incompatible with these programming languages, or that Lawrence would be so
                        foolhardy as to buy computers incompatible with ten years programming
                            work.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e667">[14]</a></p></blockquote> Such a statement may sound hubristic, but four
                    decades later, digital humanists still tend to underestimate the speed with
                    which our projects will become outdated. Digital preservation specialists
                    continue to warn humanities researchers and digital content producers that the
                    apparently durable file formats and access mechanisms of the present day are
                    less stable than they may appear [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#conway2010">Conway 2010</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#loc2013">Library of Congress 2013</a>]. Schneider’s story stands as a warning: if we wish for
                    future projects to be able to build on our tools and datasets without having to
                    start from scratch, then we must ensure that our outputs are designed to be

                    unearthed the project’s partial remains and, with the help of many
                    collaborators, begun recovering their functionality. Erin Dix, Archivist at
                    Lawrence University, helped me retrieve not only the paper files from the
                    project, but a set of 3.5" floppy discs labeled “LSP_data”
                    containing plain-text ASCII files and metadata suggesting they were written in
                        1990.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e686">[15]</a> The data
                    appears to represent a large majority of the performances from the original
                    reference book, although some gaps have been identified; notably, several
                    seasons from the 1730s and the 1780s are missing. It is unclear whether the data
                    represents the edits made over the years by research assistants, or whether it
                    represents the raw data as it arrived from Information Control Incorporated on
                    magnetic tapes; it may also represent some intermediate stage.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e689">[16]</a> What is clear, however, is
                    that it has <em class="emph">not</em> been run through the programs that parsed the data
                    for querying and expanded the cast lists; equally clear is that it has been
                    converted from EBCDIC to ASCII, with some unintended consequences. The
                    underlying hexadecimal code has been shifted such that most of the performance
                    dates are represented as special characters rather than numerals.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e699">[17]</a> Derek Miller has developed a script that corrects the hex; it
                    is important to note, however, that the data itself cannot be forensically
                    reverted, so programmatically corrected versions will always represent an
                    approximation of the original.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e703">[18]</a>

                    perhaps because it was thought to be archived at Harvard.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e709">[19]</a> Fortunately, Daland kept
                    printouts of the programs and their documentation in his personal files, and he

                    Although we experimented extensively with scan settings and image processing
                    techniques to optimize the images for OCR, we ultimately found them to be
                    resistant to character recognition and resorted to hand-transcription of sample
                    sections of the code. Working with a mainframe computer at the University of
                    Wisconsin-Madison, we tried to compile and run a hand-transcribed and -corrected
                    version of STRUCTUR, the main parsing program. After exhaustive efforts to
                    reconstruct and compile the programs in their original form, we determined that
                    doing so would be impractical; it would force us to reproduce and deal with
                    numerous constraints around memory, character sets, and encoding scheme
                    conversion that need not be factors in a modern computing environment. As a
                    result, I am currently collaborating with Todd Hugie (Director of Library
                    Information Technology, Utah State University) to re-engineer the code base in
                    Python, creating a new parser for the recovered flat-file data based on the
                    principles represented in Daland’s code. From there, we plan to transform the
                    data into XML and JSON formats for preservation and sharing, then import the
                    data into a relational database such as MySQL or MariaDB.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e712">[20]</a></div>

                        Bank</cite> responds to several needs in the scholarly community, including
                    a fundamental need for a database of the performance records in <cite class="title italic">The London Stage</cite>. The reference books remain one of
                    the most frequently consulted resources in eighteenth-century studies, and while
                    they are available in searchable form through HathiTrust, keyword search remains
                    an unsatisfactory method of querying the rich, relational information contained
                    in those pages. Scholars continue to perform hand-counts of performances of
                    interest, as Elaine McGirr does in her monograph on playwright, actor, and
                    theater manager Colley Cibber [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#mcgirr2016">McGirr 2016</a>], and as the Cambridge
                    Ben Jonson project did in constructing their searchable “Performance Archive” of stagings of Jonson plays from the
                    seventeenth century to the present.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e731">[21]</a> In 2016, publisher Adam Matthew released a new primary source
                    collection, <cite class="title italic">Eighteenth Century Drama: Censorship, Society
                        and the Stage</cite>, which is based on the Huntington Library’s Larpent
                    Collection and includes a searchable database based on <cite class="title italic">The
                        London Stage</cite>. This release generated significant interest in the
                    eighteenth-century and theater studies communities, but the limitations quickly
                    became apparent: the collection carries a high subscription fee and only
                    institutions, not individual scholars, are permitted to subscribe, making the
                    collection inaccessible to all but members of the wealthiest institutions.
                    Furthermore, the database itself is designed to permit queries only along
                    specific parameters such as title or date, rather than any kind of exploratory
                    statistical analysis of the full dataset. For these reasons, an open-access,
                    open-source database remains desirable to many researchers in these fields. </div>

                    obvious lessons in preservation and sustainability offered by the history
                    sketched out above; any new version of the database will need to adhere to
                    current best practices for sustainability, developed in consultation with
                    librarians and archivists who have expertise in this area. However, we are also
                    aware that one of the best ways to ensure preservation is to attract and
                    maintain a large and engaged user base. In order to avoid the disconnect

                    today’s humanities scholars: it would need to acknowledge its genealogy by
                    building on the past iterations; it would need to accommodate and even highlight
                    the ambiguity and messiness of the data; and it would need to contribute to
                    current efforts to develop data ontologies that make sense for theater studies.
                    The rest of this essay considers how these features would enable the database to
                    speak to current questions and debates in humanities scholarship.</div>

                    epistemological foundations of the 1970s- and 1980s-era humanities computing

                    specific questions about the theater of the time could do so, but the resource
                    would also accommodate those hoping to examine more closely the layered history
                    of the system itself. We envision an interface that allows users to download and
                    view our reengineered parsing program alongside the original version; likewise,
                    we imagine allowing users to download the flat-file database in its raw and
                    parsed forms, as well as versions of the same data stored in XML and JSON
                    formats. Such an interface would offer a unique opportunity to look underneath
                    the hood of a 1970s-era humanities computing project, and to compare the
                    underlying technological and ontological structures of Schneider’s database to
                    those of its updated counterpart. This comparison could offer a window onto the
                    architecture and assumptions about the nature of humanities data that formed the
                    invisible foundation for humanities computing work in the era–assumptions that
                    eventually made their way into many of the digital resources we rely on today,
                    often without full knowledge of their provenance or architecture. In this
                    respect, our project responds to Bonnie Mak and Ian Gadd’s calls for what Mak
                    calls an “archaeological approach” to collections like <cite class="title italic">Early English Books Online</cite> that incorporate and
                    reproduce the biases inherent in cataloging, preservation, and digitization

                    can already begin to suggest the orientation towards humanities data that it
                    represents, based on the query results published as the <cite class="title italic">Index to the London Stage</cite>. Domain-specialist users of the <cite class="title italic">Index</cite> have long recognized in its entries an
                    orientation towards historical data that is ill suited to the ambiguity
                    surrounding much of this material. For instance, a recent case study of
                    eighteenth-century London playbills shows that the many theatrical adaptations
                    of Aphra Behn’s <cite class="title italic">Oroonoko</cite>, which often go by the
                    same name in <cite class="title italic">The London Stage</cite>, actually represent a
                    variety of responses to and interpretations of the Oroonoko legend [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#vareschi2016">Vareschi and Burkert 2016</a>]. This kind of uncertainty in the historical record,
                    a reminder of our mediated access to the past, is not a concern built into the
                    architecture of the <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite>. Instead,
                    Schneider’s database takes an equivalent string of characters (play title,
                    personal name, theater location, etc.) to signify a self-same historical
                    entity.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="burkert-recovering.html#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">The <cite class="title italic">Information Bank</cite> also inherited many of the
                    problems built into its source material–such as, for instance, the lack of
                    reliable premiere dates for plays that debuted before the leading theaters began
                    running daily newspaper advertisements around 1705. Prior to that time, most
                    performance dates in <cite class="title italic">The London Stage</cite> are largely
                    conjectures based on publication dates and references in published editions of
                    plays [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#milhous1974">Milhous and Hume 1974</a>]. This kind of guessing results in entries
                    like one for a presumed February 1697 performance of <cite class="title italic">Timoleon</cite>: “It is not certain what company produced this play, if
                            it was acted; and it may not have been staged”
                         [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#avery1960">Avery et al. 1960–1968</a>, 473]. Schneider’s database has no way of representing this kind of ambiguity,
                    which is central to how scholars today approach theater history and culture;
                    McGirr, for example, devotes several pages of her book on Cibber to a discussion
                    of the limitations of the available data about performances of his plays as
                    represented in <cite class="title italic">The London Stage</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#mcgirr2016">McGirr 2016</a>, 10–13]. The <cite class="title italic">Information
                        Bank</cite>’s approach is therefore out of step with today’s theories about
                    quantitative inquiry in the humanities, which aim to acknowledge the provenance,
                    limitations, and fuzziness of the data. While 1970s-era computing may have
                    required researchers to sacrifice complexity in order to conserve memory and
                    storage resources, today we have the capacity to encode more information about
                    the provenance and limitations of data, and many digital humanities projects are
                    actively invested in finding ways to register and visualize uncertainty. </div>

                    theater studies, which, as Caplan notes, takes as its objects “incomplete
                        records of performance events rather than the live event itself.” For
                    Caplan, databases of theatrical records “tackle a recurring and significant challenge in our
                            field–the ephemerality of our medium and the dispersal of theatrical
                            ephemera that may shed light on a performance event”
                         [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#caplan2015">Caplan 2015</a>, 356–57]. One prominent example is AusStage, an ambitious database of “programs,
                        ticket stubs, newspaper clippings and so on” that seeks to document all
                    dramatic performances across Australia from 2001 to the present, as well as some
                    additional historical performance events.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e873">[24]</a> As Miller points out, projects like AusStage “force us to define
                        performance’s ontology,” articulating foundational premises such as “the relationship between performances and works, sex
                            and gender identities, and how our contemporary vocabulary for
                            performance translates that of previous eras”
                         [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#miller">Miller forthcoming</a>]. Building on his experience as a research coordinator for AusStage,
                    Jonathan Bollen has recently published an essay surveying the convergences and
                    divergences of data models for theater history; the comparison raises critical
                    questions about such fundamental issues as the basic unit of inquiry (A single
                    evening’s performance? An event lasting several evenings but having a common
                    title and cast? A production that might span multiple locations and years or
                    even decades of runs?). As more theater databases are developed, each must
                    decide whether to articulate its own unique ontology or to strive for
                    interoperability with other databases by adopting shared structures and
                    assumptions about the objects of study [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#bollen2016">Bollen 2016</a>]. Our
                    revitalization of the <cite class="title italic">London Stage Information Bank</cite>
                    would likewise need to engage in such critical self-reflection, deciding where
                    to maintain the existing data model and where to refine it, as a contributor to
                    ongoing efforts to develop data models tailored to theater studies.</div>

                    layered history of its transmissions and remediations; this is the direction we
                    hope to take the project in the future. At the same time, however, it is
                    important to realize that even our recognition of these gaps in the data is
                    mediated by the ways scholars have accessed and thought about these archival
                    records in the past. As Johanna Drucker and others have reminded us, the history
                    of the data’s collection and transmission is an intrinsic part of the object of
                    study; when we query a database of theater records, we actually query a database
                    of composite objects that encode the history of how performance has been seen,
                    recorded, preserved, cataloged and studied.<a class="noteRef" href="burkert-recovering.html#d28628e911">[25]</a> If we aim to acknowledge the messiness that lies behind the apparent

                    the years, and to unpack the ways they worked to do so. Only then can we design,
                    make, and analyze in ways that resist reproducing unchecked assumptions that
                    went into the collection and curation of existing cultural archives and their

                    performances; just as importantly, it will model and enable a critical approach
                    to the architecture of that data. In doing so, it will align with the interests

                    persistence of data models even as the data is transformed for use in other
                    projects: “datasets have the fluidity of plastic; they flow when
                            prodded, pushed, or pressed, when the heat is turned up and when placed
                            under stress. In the vocabulary of project management, datasets are
                            dumped, scanned, stretched, squeezed, shoved, massaged, cleansed, and
                            washed–in plainer terms, refactored and reformatted–and when all else
                            fails, rekeyed…Inevitably, to migrate data is to manipulate: exports
                            reveal imperfections, imports throw exceptions. And in the process of
                            manipulation, one feels the resistance of the data model. Like a habit
                            to be retrained or plastic’s retention of its form, a dataset retains
                            the memory of its model even as it is transformed”

                        developed by the editors to conserve ink and paper, but it remains a
                        perpetual frustration to users of the reference books. An illustrative
                        example is offered by an entry for Tuesday, June 25, 1708. <cite class="title italic">The Constant Couple </cite>was performed at the Theatre
                        Royal – Drury Lane with a cast “As at Queen’s, 20 Oct. 1707, but Clincher Sr
                        – Pinkethman; Lady Lurewell – Mrs Knight; Parly – Mrs Moor” [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#avery1960">Avery et al. 1960–1968</a>, 172]. The researcher turns back 17 pages to
                        the entry for that date and finds a fuller cast list: “Sir Harry – Wilks;
                        Col. Standard – Mills; Smugler – Johnson; Vizard – Husband; Clincher Sr –
                        Bowen; Clincher Jr – Bullock; Dicky – Norris; Lady Lurewell – Mrs Oldfield;
                        Lady Darling – Mrs Powell; Angelica – Mrs Bradshaw”. Combining the
                        information from these two entries, it is possible to determine that the
                        cast list for the June 25 performance was as follows: Sir Harry – Wilks;
                        Col. Standard – Mills; Smugler – Johnson; Vizard – Husband; Clincher Sr –

                        Moor. This illustration involves only two entries for the sake of
                        simplicity. However, in many instances, a researcher must follow the trail
                        back through numerous dates and many actor-role substitutions in order to

                        Drucker’s influential characterization of humanities data as
                            “capta,” a term that “acknowledges the situated, partial, and
                                constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that
                                knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural
                                representation of a pre-existing fact”
                             [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#drucker2011">Drucker 2011</a>]. Christof Schöch rejects the idea that a new term is needed, but
                        aligns with Drucker in his definition of data within humanities inquiry:
                            “a digital, selectively constructed, machine-actionable abstraction
                            representing some aspects of a given object of humanistic inquiry.”
                        This definition importantly draws attention to the added “layer of
                            mediation” created by transforming cultural artifacts into
                        discrete units of digital information [<a class="ref" href="burkert-recovering.html#schoch2013">Schöch 2013</a>]. Along
