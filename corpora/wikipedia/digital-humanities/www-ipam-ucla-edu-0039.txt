					Overview

											
							[image: CA2016 Poster Graphic]The explosion in the widespread use of the Internet and social media and the ubiquity of low cost computing have increased the possibilities for understanding cultural behaviors and expressions, while at the same time have facilitated opportunities for making cultural artifacts both accessible and comprehensible. The rapidly proliferating digital footprints that people leave as they crisscross these virtual spaces offer a treasure trove of cultural information, where culture is considered to be expressive of the norms, beliefs and values of a group. This program encourages the exploration of the unsolved mathematical opportunities that are emerging in this cultural information space. Many successful approaches to the analysis of cultural content and activities have been developed, yet there is still a great deal of work to be done. In this program, we aim to promote a vigorous collaboration across disciplines and devise new approaches and novel mathematics to address these problems of culture analytics, by bringing together leading scholars in the social sciences and humanities with those in applied mathematics, engineering, and computer science.
