Domanski</PERSON> image Abstract The landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA was the final agreement of a series of tense nuclear negotiations between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and EU3 3 countries that started from September 2013 after which the Iranian people had elected a new president and finalized in 2015 During several rounds of these negotiations we noticed that some Twitter users were seemingly trying to distract people from the flow of latest news about the most trending negotiation s hashtag IranTalks by posting irrelevant tweets at a high frequency that could be categorized as spam We collected a sampling of all the tweets that contained the IranTalks hashtag and marked the distracting tweets based on some criteria We populated a list of the spammers accounts and extracted their one on one friendship relationship following followed by We applied social and organizational network analysis techniques and found strong evidence for the existence of an organization through which the accounts responsible for such tweeting behavior are connected We believe the results of this study can stimulate more research about this social and organizational phenomenon and its possible impacts and can help in better understanding and more accurate analysis of social trends on social media platforms Contents 1 Introduction 2 Research question and significance 3 Reviewing the literature and background 4 Research method 5 Findings 6 Limitations and further research 7 Concluding remarks bookmark p1 1 <ORGANIZATION>Introduction Twitter</ORGANIZATION> is one of the most popular social media and social networking platforms that engages users in several ways Users can share their stories mainly some information about the event or otherwise users reactions to it in up to the second microblogs i e tweets Tweets can include links images and location information and users can make a tweet viral by marking it favorite and or retweeting it in a crowdsourced manner Users can also include one or more relevant keywords i e hashtags to participate in and take advantage of an automatic indexing mechanism that makes their tweets more visibility and discoverability by other users If employed properly this mechanism helps reporters promote and information consumers seek the latest news progress and opinions per desired topic around the world in a matter of seconds Twitter users can follow one another to receive each other s tweets on their timeline and can block certain users to disallow them from following their account Another way to seek tweets by the users is to employ the search mechanism to look for one or more desired hashtags or keywords that results in a list of most popular and recent tweets that contained the search term Topics that are viral among a large number of users will have trending hashtags For every trending hashtag many users are posting and are viewing the corresponding tweets If the hashtag is among the most popular hashtags in a certain time it is displayed to all users who lookup trending hashtags Thus tweets that contain trending hashtags receive more attention from a large audience just because of employing the right hashtag s at the right time However users have no restrictions on how to use hashtags including popular hashtags for any tweet even if the tweet is not relevant to the hashtag s used This leaves room for user to exploit trending hashtags for promoting totally irrelevant tweets about issues that do not have connections to the issues corresponding to the hashtag in the first place In most of these cases the users committing this action are considered spammers Employing an irrelevant or less relevant hashtag in a tweet can be have variety of motivations such as commercial advertisement of a business supporting a political rally or sometimes increasing social awareness around a forgotten or diminishing topic in the public sphere and can be done either as an individual or otherwise as a collaborative effort Such collaborative efforts sometimes try to hijack a popular hashtag for a different or maybe less relevant cause <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> 2013 These efforts in which certain technical capabilities are used without directly violating or breaking any policies or regulations in an unconventional and unexpected way compared to the generally accepted ways of using those capabilities is known as hacktivism To give their voice leverage hacktivists sometimes use pieces of software known as bots to post tweets at a higher frequency and from several different distributed accounts bookmark 1a 1 During the negotiations between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the world powers known as EU3 3 bookmark 2a 2 we noticed a situation in which irrelevant tweets were posted by some real users in a manner different from all categories above The pattern we recorded suggests an organized distributed effort mostly to distract users from receiving latest news and reactions This could not be categorized as a collective hashtag hijacking effort because the spammers were not communicating a single message although some of the recorded tweets can be categorized as such nor as a hacktivist bot based attack because there were indications that the user account are in control of real people The fundamental difference here was the evidence of a real organized coordinated effort between users engaging in this type of behavior which suggested a possible organizational mandate In fact several different messages were sent at a very high frequency that would result in hashtag spoiling Najafabadi 2017 a situation in which the real news stories and reactions regarding a viral hashtag are not easy to follow by the mainstream users because of the high frequency of repeated irrelevant outdated or even false stories posted in tweets that contain the same hashtag and dominates the hashtag search results This practice of hashtag spoiling done by real users who are already connected through a traditional organization with the goal of user distraction on a mainly political issue is we would argue a new form of hacktivism 1 1 Research overview To examine this initial thought we recorded sample sets of the tweets containing the IranTalks hashtag during a few weeks at the peak of the negotiations mostly when the IranTalks hashtag was trending These tweets were supposed to be about the nuclear negotiations We analyzed the contents of a simple random sample of the randomly recorded tweets and marked the ones irrelevant to the ongoing nuclear talks as spam by human judgement We populated a list of active spammers that contained all the users responsible for five or more spams We employed social and organizational network analysis SNA techniques to check upon meaningful signs of relationships between those spammers i e a network structure that could signal a corresponding physical organization of the spammers and made an assertion about the possible motivations for this organized behavior Table 1 summarizes the research steps and the instruments and outcomes per step We finish the paper by listing some other possibilities for further analyzing social network actors and by explaining the possible impact of this phenomenon on analyzing social media here Twitter data bookmark tab1 Table 1 Research steps and their instruments and outcomes Step Activity Tool s Outcome 1 We collected sample <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> data containing the IranTalks hashtag in decks of the most recent 100 tweets at intervals of every few hours during peak times of the IranTalks We repeated this procedure 100 times to end up with 100 twitter decks each containing 100 tweets and its corresponding metadata We made simple exclusions in the query to exclude simple and detectable bots activity Twitter API Python code Initially sampled tweet decks 2 We randomly selected 25 out of 100 decks of tweets each deck containing 100 actual tweets for coding and further analysis Simple random sampling Confirmed sampled tweet decks 3 We coded the tweets in each sampled deck based on their relevance to the ongoing nuclear negotiations 0 relevant 1 irrelevant To minimize human bias we only included users with more than five spam tweets on our spammers list populated from all our sampled decks an initial list of 57 users was formed Manual coding List of twitter users with identified spamming activity 4 We extracted one on one Twitter relationships follows and followed by for every possible pair of the users in our spammers list and formed a friendship matrix Python code Friendship matrix 5 Using social and organizational network analysis techniques we identified analyzed and visualized some network characteristics of the spammers network The findings led to conclusions about possible existence of an organization and a possible mandate of users activity on Twitter regarding the IranTalks Social network analysis Assertions about the organization of the spammers 6 We took a retrospective look at the un sampled tweet decks to see what information we can find about our top spammers to see whether this information is also a match with our findings from previous step or not Simple user detection Added insights about the spammers activity image bookmark p2 2 Research question and significance As explained earlier during some rounds of nuclear negotiations we noticed a situation in which some Twitter users were seemingly trying to distract other Twitter users from the flow of latest news about and reactions to the most trending negotiation s hashtag IranTalks We focused on discovering possible indications of an organized distributed effort to misuse a trending popular hashtag or hashtag spoiling targeting the real time news coverage of the nuclear negotiations We checked the accounts of a few of these users and found some similarities in their demographics and their tweeting behavior Besides these similarities the way these users exploited the IranTalks hashtag to post their tweets was abnormal very frequent tweets or repetition of tweets by others and not retweeting the exact same content from other similar users less relevant or irrelevant and outdated or even tweets that contained fake news We were interested to find out if this was an individual behavior by some random users who just feel that they should engage in such activity to amplify their voice by hijacking the IranTalks hashtag or if it was an organized effort launched by an existing institution in the physical world Our specific research question in this study was Are there evidence that there is an organization or a number of organizations through which these specific spammers who are showing this type of unique spamming behavior are connected We believed that extracting Twitter relationships between the user accounts who followed this pattern of tweeting could help us in finding an answer to this question This research can help us understand the situations in which this behavior is likely to occur and allows us to recognize it when it takes place and depending on the situation make sure that we would account for it when we are conducting social network analysis This study can generate more insights about this type of behavior s short term and long term repercussions and can possibly help evolve more effective counter mechanisms enhanced by social media platform algorithms and by participation of social media users individually or collectively In other words this study can increase individual users awareness and inform the user community to keep away from such distraction and keep up with the real flow of an under attack hashtag and even further help with some crowdsourced counter mechanisms image bookmark p3 3 Reviewing the literature and background In the following subsections we provide a twofold literature review The first part covers modern hacktivism in the age of Internet and social media and a background on the various ways in which specific cyberspace can be misappropriated to advance political agendas The second part explains the history and sociopolitical backgrounds in which the nuclear negotiations took place 3 1 Hacktivism Political or ideological motivations for misuse Social media platforms are now employed by politicians and by officials at different levels of governments as well as by individuals businesses and social activists as an enabler for their social outreach for promoting supporting or opposing a cause or an idea <PERSON>Sandoval Almazan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gil Garcia</PERSON> 2014 Jungherr 2016 <LOCATION>Khazraee</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Losey</PERSON> 2016 <PERSON>Rossini</PERSON> et al 2017 <PERSON>DePaula</PERSON> et al 2018 In some cases different methods of political spamming is used as an opposing digital action Political and ideological spams are mostly aimed to promote a perspective or belief or otherwise as we observed in this study distract users from following the normal flow of tweets In fact social media is known to have an effect on the evolution of a user s opinions He et al 2017 and thus political causes and figures try to shape or shift public opinion for or against an issue <PERSON>Dincelli</PERSON> et al 2016 Although affecting public opinion is a normal activity in a democratic society filling the public space with false news is in most cases prohibited by domestic and national laws and regulations and is considered illegal and in many instance unethical Considering the recent findings about how some thousand organized social media pages or bots actively have spread false news or fake opinions to some targeted audiences for example in the 2016 U S elections <PERSON>Shane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Goel</PERSON> 2017 <PERSON>Entous</PERSON> et al 2017 <PERSON>Bastos</PERSON> and Mercea 2017 reveals the importance of studying these types of user behavior in social media and its effects As illustrated in Figure 1 there are various ways in which people seek to respond to or protest against their ideological opponents in cyberspace bookmark fig1 image Spectrum of cyber spatial activities Figure 1 Spectrum of cyber spatial activities <PERSON>Domanski</PERSON> 2015 Cyberactivism refers to the use of the Internet and social media tools to communicate with others in support of or in opposition to a cause <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> 1999 Examples include online petitions organized information campaigns in social media forums like <ORGANIZATION>Facebook</ORGANIZATION> groups Web sites that seek to disseminate information about a cause or an upcoming event general recruitment to an activist organization etc These are all legally and constitutionally accepted forms of political activism whose implementations have simply migrated to cyberspace They might seek to disrupt the sociopolitical status quo but do so legally and with an eye towards organizing and mobilizing people to collective action Cracktivism on the other hand is where the boundary is crossed from legal acts of political expression over to illicit and criminal actions It refers to unauthorized intrusions of private software systems defacement the destruction and or theft of information and more While admittedly often still motivated by political ideology cracktivism does value destruction as its goal If sponsored by governmental actors it then falls into the classification of cyberwarfare <PERSON>Rosenzweig</PERSON> 1998 <PERSON>Curran</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> 2013 Hacktivism by contrast refers to a similar type of largely benign but disruptive not destructive form of political expression Acts of hacktivism by definition do not seek to destroy their targets It is the act of computer hacking for political purposes and stems from the original meaning of the term hacking utilized since the 1970s meaning to make use of something for a purpose other than for which it was originally intended <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> 2004 There is an important distinction between hacking and hacktivism Hacking is a clever use of technology for virtually any purpose often self interested Bell 2001 Hacktivism on the other hand is a clever use of technology specifically to express oneself politically It can be thought of as a form of political speech <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 2013 often administered through code and automation designed as an unexpected exploitation of technological capabilities Hacktivism has a history reaching back at least to the early 2000s Morozov 2011 and its current incarnations include relatively infamous collectives such as Anonymous and 4Chan Coleman 2015 An early prominent example of hacktivism was the introduction of the Googlebomb bookmark 3a 3 and some unconventional exploitation of the <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> s PageRank algorithm to effectively manipulate the search results relating to specific political figures For example beginning in 2003 a <ORGANIZATION>Googlebomb</ORGANIZATION> made it so that whenever a user searched for the phrase miserable failure a biography of <PERSON>George W Bush</PERSON> was displayed as the first result Cohen 2007 Similarly in January 2009 before even taking the oath of office opponents of President Elect <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> made it so that he sat atop the search results for failure while simultaneously his supporters produced the same effect for cheerful achievement <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> 2009 There are several more examples of such activity <PERSON>Havenstein</PERSON> 2008 Amira 2011 Hacktivism also includes misusing some mechanisms that are in place to avoid this type of behavior For instance by using a social media platform s crowdsourced report mechanism which is originally to help stopping users from violating laws and acceptable use policies some accounts might be attacked with false reports and thus might be suspended at least temporarily There was an instance of this in the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> s 2016 presidential primaries where <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> s campaign was accused of buying social media trolls May 2016 and made efforts to shut down some of <PERSON>Bernie Sanders</PERSON> accounts on social media using this technique <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> 2016 <PERSON>Zimmerman</PERSON> 2016 The legality of hacktivism sometimes finds itself in a gray zone as such acts are not overtly criminal by nature <PERSON>Domanski</PERSON> 2015 Rather like cyberactivism they seek to disrupt the political status quo through expression often with the ultimate goal of gaining mainstream attention to their advocated position on an issue Nevertheless such activities raise numerous problematic challenges for regulators Spinello 2002 The difference between cyberactivism and hacktivism is that whereas the targets of a cyberactivist lie in real space for example in an online petition to change a local school board ordinance environmental regulation or some other type of public policy the targets of hacktivism exist in cyberspace For example in redirecting visitors trying to reach the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> Web site to a different site expressing opposition to the President s position on an issue no actual damage is being done to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> site no information is being stolen and their administrators will surely fix the redirect in a brief amount of time However the story would hopefully in the hacktivist s mind garner media and public attention to the cause he or she was trying to advocate for and might ultimately have repercussions in real space politics Individuals and different groups of people e g people being affected by a policy in a certain part of a country or in a certain industry or likewise can have political and ideological motivations for hacktivism They sometimes find themselves collaborating in an act of hacktivism due to popularity of a cause or purpose In some instances of the group action however acts of hacktivism is performed by a group of people are already connected and organized through an existing institutional mechanism in the real space In this case the users can simply organize their online activities e g spamming for greater effectiveness but most often their activities will contain enough footprints that would indicate the existence of such organization 3 2 Related work Political spamming has been a hot research topic recently see several related references in the previous section and in the current section Previous studies have reported instances of hacktivism in which social media capacities are used in large scale in an unexpected way <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> 2005 <PERSON>Hampson</PERSON> 2012 Deseriis 2017 Solomon 2017 There are also many studies that include cases in which spamming is performed by programmed software bots Sedhai and Sun 2015 Deseriis 2017 <PERSON>Bessi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> 2016 <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> et al 2016 Woolley 2016 Su rez <PERSON>Serrato</PERSON> et al 2016 Stukal et al 2017 or by real people <PERSON>Irani</PERSON> et al 2010 Song et al 2011 <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> et al 2011 <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> et al 2012 Hadgu et al 2013 <PERSON>Yang</PERSON> et al 2014 Almaatouq et al 2014 <PERSON>Wu</PERSON> et al 2017 often organized by an entity such as a government or a social or political group Qtiesh 2011 Emspak 2011 Finley 2015 King et al 2017 Stukal et al 2017 Leonnig et al 2017 Finley 2015 One popular way of propagating spam in Twitter is by misusing a hashtag that is already designated to a viral conversation This is mostly done by including the hashtag in a high volume of tweets that are irrelevant to the corresponding conversation Although some spammers try to hijack the trending hashtags to communicate their own message to the users who are engaged with the original conversation some other spammers mostly with political aims do not necessarily communicate a specific message in their spams and they only want to distract users from following that conversation This type of spamming would result in disrupting the formation of social conversations around that issue interfering with the normal shaping of public opinion and deflecting public opinion by using propaganda to amplify a point of view that is not prolifically supported and at the bottom line affecting people s choices based on the wrong perceptions they would receive from spammers activities In different studies those instances are referred to as hashtag spamming <PERSON>Hyun</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> 2016 Sedhai and Sun 2015 hashtag hijacking or hashjacking for short Hadgu et al 2013 <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and Foucault Welles 2015 <PERSON>Virmani</PERSON> et al 2017 or trend stuffing <PERSON>Irani</PERSON> et al 2010 based on the details of the case study In our case though the characteristics are slightly different It is done in a distributed and organized manner it is performed by real people who as we will see are connected through a traditional organization which is not a government and their aim seems not to be promoting a unique message or Web site but to distract the public and interfere with the normal shaping of public opinion We call this specific type of spamming as hashtag spoiling <PERSON>Najafabadi</PERSON> 2017 bookmark 4a 4 3 3 The sociopolitical grounds of the phenomenon under study After the Iranian people elected a new president in 2013 within a matter of months the long halted negotiations restarted between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the EU3 3 countries and escalated to the ministry level These negotiations eventually created the longest and most complex international arms control agreement ever at 159 pages Porter 2015 It took almost two years to achieve a final agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA which was backed by a <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION> resolution bookmark 5a 5 It imposed major restrictions on the Iranian nuclear program and put Iranian nuclear facilities under strict and thorough surveillance In return the deal mandates that the international community would accept a safe level of uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for civilian and research purposes and would lift and ultimately revoke all nuclear related embargoes sanctions and corresponding restrictive regulations bookmark 6a 6 This was the result of several rounds of tense negotiations closely followed by the media journalists advocacy groups and lobbyists investors researchers and also individual people Twitter was a popular tool for these stakeholders to keep up with the most recent developments in the talks In each round of the negotiations formal or leaked news about a possible failure or success of the negotiations was highly impactful on the popularity of the IranTalks and some other relevant hashtag s bookmark 7a 7 During the two years of negotiations some external entities tried to disrupt the progress because any kind of agreement that would end the isolation of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> from the global market regardless of the terms of the agreement would have been counted a game changing loss for the entities benefiting from the status quo These entities form a wide spectrum ranging from some countries in the region and in the world to some powerful lobbies and influential groups both in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U S Newspaper Internet TV</ORGANIZATION> ads significant investments in lobbying efforts several rounds of meetings between high officials of the countries public speeches and the propagation of falsified information all were among the techniques used However the negotiations finally produced the JCPOA as an agreed upon roadmap for all negotiating parties Given this atmosphere it was not unexpected to find that there were some politically motivated organized efforts to misuse Twitter capabilities to hijack negotiation s hashtag s image bookmark p4 4 Research method Politically motivated activities that fit into hacktivism and similar categories are more likely to be committed by groups of people and thus can be studied for organized behavior Thus social and organizational networks analysis SNA tools and techniques can help us reveal some information about the users hereafter actors based on their position in the identified network In Twitter as well as many other social media platforms in which users can post almost anything at their discretion the complexities and conflicts of information rights user rights and acceptable use policies makes it hard to distinguish between normal activity and spam This is because some users might see a tweet as a spam i e irrelevant or less relevant to the employed hashtag s and some may not and even more some might even believe that the distraction goal and its repercussions on public opinion and awareness are always relevant Thus categorizing tweets that contain a specific hashtag as spam would be more valid if more distinctive criteria were employed although any criteria would still be debatable Thus we tried to employ techniques to make sure that we identified spammers in a way that was acceptable by a larger community of Twitter users see subsection 4 5 Inclusion criteria As illustrated earlier in Table 1 we wrote a Python script and used it to collect a sample of IranTalks tweets on occasions when the hashtag was highly used in tweets We coded a sample of the tweets and identified some of them as spam in cases where we found a disconnect between the content of the tweet and the IranTalks hashtag Next we populated a list of the user accounts responsible for five or more spams in at least one dataset tweet deck For the second round of data collection we evaluated the Twitter relationship following and followed by for all pairs of user accounts in our spammers list from the previous step and formed a friendship matrix Finally we used the UCINET software v 6 611 to analyze this network We have highlighted our major findings of this network assessment below and also in the Findings section 4 1 Preparation and logistics To avoid biases from Twitter algorithms that favor some tweets based on users historical activity patterns we created a new Twitter account and made some anonymity precautions to avoid any of such heuristics tailoring and filtering algorithms applied to our search results We also used a new workstation and Internet connection for account creation while no other Twitter login session was active to make sure Twitter would not bind this new account to any existing account behavior 4 2 Round 1 of data collection Round 1 data collection for this study was a two step process We programmed and used a Python script to collect data directly from <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> using a Twitter application programming interface API facilitated by a public Python library We executed this Python script in certain intervals i e every two to four hours at times when the negotiations were active and the IranTalks hashtag was at the peak of its use by many Twitter users worldwide We recorded one hundred tweets per run the maximum that the <ORGANIZATION>Twitter API</ORGANIZATION> allows us to collect in every attempt free of charge The data collected contained the body i e text of the tweets plus some metadata such as timestamps number of followers of the sender of the tweets date of account creation and in some cases even more information like geographical location based on user preferences and privacy settings of the corresponding user account Upon fetching a tweet deck the Python code also parsed the tweets and exported selected elements we deemed important for our analysis into MS Excel worksheets one Excel worksheet per tweet deck or dataset 4 3 Sampling As explained earlier a part of the sampling was done by <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> due to the Twitter API s rate limit on free Twitter data This API returns 100 tweets per call which seemed sufficicent for this study After it reached its predefined maximum capacity in most cases 15 API function calls per user it stopped for a 15 minute window before it functioned again Each of the collected tweet decks was stored in a separate Excel file We used simple random sampling and selected 25 out of 100 for this study 4 4 Coding We used human judgment to identify spam tweets We marked a tweet as spam if it did not contain something directly relevant to the nuclear talks between EU3 3 and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> These criteria were judged based on familiarity with the issue We did not mark a tweet as spam unless there was strong evidence for it based on our criteria both in content and tweeting retweeting behavior e g false information outdated posts tweets containing links to non credible Web sites and very high frequency of tweets bookmark p45 4 5 Inclusion criteria To make sure we were focusing on certain spamming behavior we defined another inclusion criterion for coded datasets We decided to only include datasets that contained at least one user with five or more tweets coded as spam Based on this new criterion seven of the datasets did not meet inclusion criteria at this stage and the remaining 18 other datasets met the criteria 4 6 Data cleansing In the middle of the data collection phase we noticed some efforts to hijack the IranTalks hashtag These efforts were conducted by different interest groups and were also facilitated by some Twitter bots Among the interest groups we detected were some pro <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> bot spams pro Saudi bot spams and some bot spams and real person spams from within U S political coalitions In the middle of the data collection stage for example some pro Saudi spammers bots started to use the IranTalks hashtag to propagate supportive messages about the war in <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> conducted by the coalition of <LOCATION>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia KSA</LOCATION> and its allies From the frequency of the tweets and the similarity of the contents although they were not retweets of each other and some other footprints it was clear that they were generated and posted by bots not by real people The focus of this study was to detect organizational characteristics of real users with prearranged mandates on misusing Twitter capabilities Therefore we intentionally excluded the bots activities We could exclude most of the bots activities with just a little twist to the original search query by which we fetched tweet samples All the bots we detected were promoting specific hashtags which we employed as a filtering mechanism to exclude bots from our initial data collection query Despite these precautions some of these bot propagated tweets passed through our filters and ended up in the sampled datasets but not at a large scale In addition we realized that in some of our sampled datasets there were human spammers with different interests and patterns of activity e g business interests than the ones who were the subject of this study Human spammers with different interests were almost impossible to exclude from recorded data but they were usually posting spam tweets at a much lower rate not affecting the results of our analysis Here in most instances these spammers were detected with only one spam in a 100 tweet dataset which increases the chances that it was an individual user Our final inclusion criterion excluded such individuals i e they did not appear in our final list of spammers We also noticed that two of the sampled tweet decks had a time overlap with each other but since the identification of the spammers was done based on each tweet deck it did not violate the integrity of our method Before the analysis we removed four isolated actors which did not seem a part of this spammer network However there could be other possibilities 1 A false positive in our spam criteria or 2 Sampling error which implies that our sampling technique did not capture spammer actors who could bridge a relationship between the main network and the isolates i e corresponding dyadic connections were absent only in our sample 4 7 Identifying most active spammers To decrease the likelihood of false positive spam detection we defined a new criterion for counting an account as a spammer each spammer had to have five or more tweets marked as spam in any of our sample datasets of 100 tweets Thus any user with four or fewer recorded spam tweets per dataset were not counted as a spammer These criteria captured those actors that were doing a recognizable spamming job which made our analysis more robust This also made it more suitable for our SNA at this stage since we were trying to analyze the network of the spammers at the dyadic level Finally we created one list of all the accounts responsible for five or more spam tweets in each of our 25 datasets 4 8 Round 2 of data collection Extracting the friendship matrix We used another Python script to extract Twitter friendship relationships following followed by between every pair of actors in our spammer lists This formed a bidirectional social network which enabled us to employ social network analysis SNA tools and techniques to acquire more information about the network The friendship data was extracted from Twitter in spring 2016 based on the list of spammers that was populated in winter and spring 2015 rounds of data collection 4 9 Social network analysis We employed social network analysis <ORGANIZATION>SNA</ORGANIZATION> concepts to find meaningful insights about our hypothesis i e existence of the spammers organization based on our sample data In our analysis we exclusively relied on Twitter data Knowing nothing about the true relationships while trying to come up with assertions solely based on the data we used a black box analysis We started by using simple network characteristics then we identified the most influential network actors based on the <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> data we extracted and then we tried to identify some cohesive subgroups in the network which basically showed subgroups of the network who were very well connected to each other 4 10 Final round of analysis A retrospective look at the unsampled datasets Although the original <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> data was collected in the spring of 2015 and the friendship matrices were extracted in the spring of 2016 we decided to conduct a retrospective analysis in the datasets that were not selected in our initial sample for the study Thus having populated the spammer list from our sample we checked the rest of the datasets the unselected tweet decks to find if the identified spammers appeared in some tweets There was no coding involved in this step and we simply counted the number of appearances of each of the spamming user accounts to find if there was a meaningful pattern of activity related to our research image bookmark p5 5 Findings To have an assertion about the organization of user accounts we considered several aspects of user account characteristics and patterns of behavior We documented patterns of account activities and demographics and employed SNA techniques to find meaningful clues about an organization network related to spamming activities 5 1 Data description and statistics As illustrated in Figure 2 some of the sampled tweet decks have significantly shorter durations vertical timescale equaled one hour This was due to the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>Twitter API</ORGANIZATION> collects the last 100 tweets at each call Thus in peak times of the IranTalks hashtag to collect the most recent 100 tweets required going back to a shorter period of time because tweets were posted more frequently The data description and statistics even before employing any SNA techniques often can generate insights about the phenomenon We divided these insights into two types insights related to characteristics of the data and insights generated after coding took place bookmark fig2 image Sampled tweet decks timestamp and duration Figure 2 Sampled tweet decks timestamp and duration Note Larger version of figure available here Even before we began coding we found some signs of abnormal activity For instance regardless of the content of tweets the volume of tweets and the high frequency of posting tweets using a specific hashtag around one tweet every six seconds could hardly be considered a normal user activity As we found patterns of activities that did not fit into Twitter bot activities we believe it was an effort to help with distraction of Twitter users from following the IranTalks hashtag as discussed earlier For instance in our sampled data we found that certain Twitter accounts were bombarding the IranTalks hashtag Here are a few instances to support this assertion A total of 43 tweets in 4 minutes and 53 seconds by one user out of 100 dataset 02 of which 12 had met our inclusion criteria as spam A total of 37 tweets in 4 minutes and 18 seconds by another user out of 100 dataset 15 of which 16 had met our inclusion criteria as spam and A total of 38 tweets in 4 minutes and 38 seconds by another out of 100 dataset 18 of which 35 had met our inclusion criteria as spam To come up with these numbers we initially created a list of all identified spammers This list contained 286 accounts that 1 had posted at least one spam tweet according to our inclusion criteria 2 were responsible for 814 spam tweets and 3 comprised a total of 1 041 tweets in the datasets they had at least one tweet labeled as spam However we discovered that 19 accounts out of 286 less than seven percent were responsible for roughly 50 percent of the tweets and that five of these accounts appeared more than once one account appeared three times in our sampled datasets On the demographics the accounts of over 85 prcent of identified active spammers were created either late 2013 or early 2014 the first months that the new Iranian government took office For each dataset each file containing 100 tweets once the coding of the data was completed we created an overview table to summarize demographics and information about patterns of activity in that dataset specifically the identified spammer accounts names total number of their tweets in the that dataset and number of tweets marked as spam Table 2 is a sample of the overview tables that summarized a deck of 100 tweets that were sent in 4 minutes and 52 seconds In this deck the user in the first row posted 43 total tweets average of one tweet per 6 79 seconds 31 of which we coded as spam This user and the user in the second row accounted for 67 percent of the total IranTalks tweets recorded in that short time period of which 54 percent were coded as spam The accounts were created on two consecutive days in November 2013 The overview tables revealed that some spammers posted tweets either detected as spam or not more often than others at least in the recorded samples Further assessment showed that most of the tweets by the spammers accounts even some that did not meet our inclusion criteria and thus were not marked as spam were in fact negative posts opposing the Iranian government and or against making progress in the talks bookmark tab2 Table 2 Overview table of a sample tweet

followers Figure 3 illustrates the number of users recorded per sampled tweet deck vs the number of active spammers identified This figure suggests that as the number of total users in a dataset decreases the portion of tweets by spammer accounts increases In other words it seems there was a base of spamming activity in each dataset regardless of whether other users were tweeting about the hashtag or not bookmark fig3 image Number of users recorded per sampled tweet deck vs the number of active spammers identified Figure 3 Number of users recorded per sampled tweet deck vs the number of active spammers identified Note Larger version of figure available here We also examined the time factor Figure 3 shows that as the IranTalks hashtag was used by more users in a shorter time period i e the hashtag was increasingly trending the number of spammers was a smaller percentage of total users In other words the number of spammers did not increase proportionally to the number of the users in a dataset This suggests a limited number of spamming accounts and a pattern that was different from general Twitter users reacting to the IranTalks hashtag To better illustrate this we plotted the percentage of spammers by the duration of each of our sampled datasets Figure 4 It clearly suggests that as the duration of the dataset increases identified spammers were a smaller portion of the total users bookmark fig4 image Percentage of spammers by duration of dataset Figure 4 Percentage of spammers by duration of dataset Note Larger version of figure available here Our analysis of the identified active spammers the spammers who met our selection criteria as illustrated in Figure 5 shows that given the number of spammers that account for a lot of tweeting activity a high frequency tweeting pattern suggests spamming behavior Comparing Figure 5 and Figure 2 gives a better understanding of the average time between each of the tweets as explained in the sample data at the beginning of this section To better illustrate this we calculated the average number of seconds between each tweet of the most active spammers Figure 5 bookmark fig5 image Frequency of tweeting activity from most active spammers Figure 5 Frequency of tweeting activity from most active spammers Note Larger version of figure available here As illustrated in Figure 5 the most active spammers were tweeting on average one tweet every seven to 14 seconds That was only their recorded activity within a sampled dataset of 100 tweets at a specific time in negotiations Figure 6 shows the aggregate number of tweets and the number of tweets that were marked as spam per identified active spammer in the sampled dataset These numbers are clearly abnormal for a typical Twitter user The number of identified spams illustrated in Figure 7 also confirm this finding bookmark fig6 image Most active spammers by aggregated count of tweets and spams Figure 6 Most active spammers by aggregated count of tweets and spams Note Larger version of figure available here bookmark fig7 image Spamming pattern by active spammers per sampled dataset Figure 7 Spamming pattern by active spammers per sampled dataset Note Larger version of figure available here We extracted tweeting patterns of identified spammers from all datasets Although we had collected and selected a very sparse sample of datasets three spammers appeared in three of the datasets and another 20 had appeared twice A deeper look at the contents of the tweets revealed that many of the spam tweets mentioned the <ORGANIZATION>Mojahedin</ORGANIZATION> e <LOCATION>Khalgh</LOCATION> organization <ORGANIZATION>MKO</ORGANIZATION> or MEK leader s Twitter handle in many of their tweets in an irrelevant manner to the negotiations probably to make her more visible and give her credit for being mentioned several times or maybe to report the progress they made toward an assigned duty These clues indicated that this tweeting behavior was probably part of an organizationally mandated agenda most likely attributed to the members of the MEK which also introduced themselves as the <ORGANIZATION>People s Mojahedin of Iran PMOI National Liberation Army of Iran NLA National Council of Resistance for Iran NCRI</ORGANIZATION> Muslim Iranian Student s Society and even some more This is the largest anti Iranian terrorist organization with a history that goes back to the time of the Shah in the 1960s Mejdini 2016 Pike 2017 bookmark 8a 8 The U S had listed the MEK as a foreign terrorist organization on 8 October 1997 and removed it from the list on 28 September 2012 bookmark 9a 9 We found that they repeatedly retweeted or even copied their fellow tweets at a high frequency copying the exact content of someone else s tweet on a large scale instead of retweeting it is not considered a normal activity They also included in their tweets Web URLs bookmark 10a 10 to one of their organizational Web sites thus bombarding the IranTalks hashtag with tweets containing fake news and opinions unrelated to the subject 5 2 Basic network characteristics Network connectedness and geodesic distances Our active spammers list of 57 users contained only a few isolates i e actors who were not connected to the rest of the network Best practice in social network analysis is to remove isolates if they are not a major part of the network After elimination of the isolates we had a directed non symmetric friendship matrix corresponding to our list of active spammers extracted from the following out degree and being followed by in degree relationships on Twitter The overall average degree for the actors was 17 49 out of possible 52 connections per actor which indicated a highly connected network with a normalized network density of 33 64 percent This shows the percentage of all possible links in the network that actually exist in other words on average the portion of all possible one on one friendship relationships that are in place For interpreting this number in a directed graph we should remember that each pair of actors can have two relationships actor A following actor B and actor B following actor A Each of these relationships either exists or is missing In our data 21 percent of the actors were fully connected they followed each other and 46 15 percent of actors had at least one form of direct connection following being followed by or both which we considered a significant finding for our hypothesis This density indicated that almost one third of all possible dyads were present in this network 927 ties out of the total 2 756 total possible dyads in our directed graph This number clearly suggests a well connected network Another factor illustrating the connectedness of this network was the average distance of 1 68 which shows that every actor was within reach by 1 68 dyads i e edges or ties between actors on average from any point in the diagraph The diameter of the network i e the longest path between any two actors in the network after removing the isolates was only four edges By looking at the geodesic distances matrix it appears that except for one pair of actors the diameter of the rest of the network is three These findings also support the presence of a well connected network 5 3 Centrality and prestige measures There are several methods to calculate the centrality and prestige measures of a social network Most often the results of one method is congruent with other methods For our application of centrality here on Twitter friendship relationships in which network actors can follow each other asymmetrically the degree centrality is a good fit The basic idea is to find the most influential actors of the network in terms of connections to other actors Other forms of centrality calculations include betweenness centrality and closeness centrality Since we are dealing with a directed graph corresponding to the Twitter friendship following and followed by of the spammers network we may also refer to the incoming centrality measures here the in degree measure as the prestige of the actor that is an indication of how popular an actor is among all other network members In our case the degree centrality analysis depicted a few outstanding accounts of which some had high out degree dyads to the network following some had high in degree dyads from the network being followed by and some had both For instance the users BalouchN2 and IranArabSpring had the highest in degrees of 45 86 5 percent and 42 80 8 percent out of 52 which could be interpreted as accounts associated with more popularity or those with a higher rank in an organizational order The users no2censorship and peymaneh123 each had 43 out degrees 82 7 percent out of 52 which could be interpreted as their extensive activity in following other accounts which in some cases could persuade the followed account to follow back helping to spread tweets of the original account The accounts IranArabSpring and peymaneh123 had the highest numbers for both in degree and out degree centrality Besides the degree centrality analysis other popular centrality measures also illustrated very similar results Although the degree centralization is mostly calculated for individual actors within a network graph the whole network can also be assigned a network centrality measure This number is maximized in a star network <PERSON>Wasserman</PERSON> and Faust 1994 in which only one actor is connected directly to all other actors For our network of identified spammers the normalized degree centralization of the network was 51 percent which is significant and implies a connected set of actors This suggests that no one actor completely dominated other actors in having direct connections to them 5 4 Cohesive subgroups Analyzing the cohesive subgroups helped us understand the internal structure of a network The most cohesive subgroups by using the cliques procedure returns no results in a directed graph However if we symmetrize the data using the Max Sym procedure there will be a huge number 218 of cliques of size 3 or more We decided to increase the n to find the largest cliques in the symmetrized network We ended up with 18 as the size which returned six cliques In other words there are at least six different sets of actors in which they were fully connected to each other and each of these sets contained 18 actors either by following by being followed or both since we symmetrized the friendship matrix for this procedure The clique participation scores revealed that 13 actors were present in all these cliques Not surprisingly the actors already identified in the previous section in the centrality and prestige calculations also appeared in this list Some of these 13 very well connected actors also had a very high frequency of posting tweets in the recorded datasets and six of them appeared more than once In our cohesive subgroup analysis over the directed graph we also observed that there were three 2 cliques in the network subgroups which only lack two dyads to become maximally connected These numbers were a strong indication of some type of organizational relationships among the actors we identified as spammers Another interpretation was that there is a set of very well connected central actors in the network and that other actors in the network were connected to the rest of the network through them The following core periphery analysis also supported this interpretation 5 5 Core periphery analysis The core periphery analysis is a helpful tool that allows splitting network actors into two groups of which the core actors have strong network ties and are considered central to the network while the periphery actors have fewer ties with the core and much fewer ties among themselves In our spammers network the core actors formed a subnetwork of 23 actors in which the density of the network was 77 percent i e 77 percent of all possible following and followed by ties in fact exist Sixty one percent of actors were fully connected they both follow each other and there was at least one form of direct connection between 93 percent of the actors The density of the periphery network containing the rest of spammers 30 actors was only seven percent This could be an indication of a specific role that the core actors had undertaken in managing social media activities or some other form of affiliation between core actors It also might indicate that some of the actors in the periphery group might not be a member of a specific organization and might have been acting like one of them for some reason 5 6 Network diagram A network diagram Figure 8 can clarify how intensely these spammers were connected to each other A network diagram visualizes friendship following being followed by relationships among actors As Figure 8 illustrates many actors in the network had direct connections to each other This network contains only the spammers identified from a simple random sample of collected tweets so this diagram could be an indication of the organization network we were testing for This network diagram as well as the high measure of network density both support our initial hypothesis of the existence of an organized network of spammers bookmark fig8 image Network diagram of the dyadic relationships Figure 8 Network diagram of the dyadic relationships Note Larger version of figure available here 5 7 A retrospective look at the unsampled datasets We coded a sample subset of our collected tweet decks due to the difficulty of manually coding all the collected tweets and because only a sample seemed a sufficient proof of concept to determine whether if our hypothesized pattern of behavior was taking place or not Once we had generated a list of active spammers from the sampled data we could take a retrospective look at the rest of the data and find confirmatory or non confirmatory evidence with no need to code more tweets 75 remaining tweet decks each containing the 100 most recent tweets with the IranTalks hashtag at the time we ran our data collection Python script Thus we analyzed the rest of the datasets against our list of active spammers to discover 1 how many times each spammer appeared in another dataset 2 how many tweets the spammer posted that were recorded in the rest of the data and 3 what was the approximate average interval of time between the spammer s tweets Here are the highlights The top numbers for appearance in other datasets were 13 9 9 8 7 7 several 6 and several 5 appearances and so on The maximum number of tweets posted by one of the spammers in a single dataset 52 40 39 28 26 25 22 21 19 and so on However there is a time factor for each dataset which is variable That means the numbers reported here might be the tweets that were posted over a short period of time or they might have been posted over a longer period of time Thus we also looked into the duration of each dataset the difference between the timestamp of the first and the last tweet recorded in each dataset and calculated the approximate average intervals between a spammer s tweet postings We say approximate because duration is a factor of the dataset while the duration between a spammer s first and last tweets in each dataset is probably a smaller number and thus if the frequency is calculated based on that number we would get a smaller number as the intervals between tweets which is even more significant The lowest average time lapse in seconds between tweets of spammers in a single dataset is 5 8 9 11 11 13 and so on We are just reporting the lowest number for each spammer that was seen among all 75 datasets In fact there were spammers who had a record of having more than just one of these very low time intervals between their tweets For instance the spammer who was accounted for the five second interval between tweets also had a record of 12 and another record of 13 in two other datasets or similarly the spammer with nine seconds between tweets was also seen in another dataset with a time interval of 11 seconds between tweets We found these findings confirmatory with our findings that the aim of this pattern of activity on Twitter was to distract users from following updates on the IranTalks hashtag Since a similar pattern of activity was recorded from users who happened to have very similar account demographics and characteristics we can assert that there had been some intentional and organized effort of disruption image bookmark p6 6 Limitations and further research For conducting this study we had to rely on the free Twitter API for our data collection as Twitter does not allow access to a complete set of tweets resulting from a search query if there are more than a certain number within a given interval of time this is called the rate limit of the Twitter API Therefore a researcher cannot use his own method of sampling all tweets without invoking some charges and fees Thus in most cases when a researcher hits the rate limit cap in the free version of the Twitter API the <ORGANIZATION>API</ORGANIZATION> makes a first level sampling of the data In this study we relied on this mechanism every time we executed our Python script to collect the latest 100 tweets on the IranTalks hashtag Moreover the Twitter account used for fetching tweets was created specifically for this project to avoid any effects of previous activities on Twitter filtering mechanisms But even for brand new accounts Twitter uses some location and demographic information from the hosting computer and network to tailor tweets returned for a hashtag search and that also can have an impact on fetched tweets Another limitation resulting from this mechanism is that since the <ORGANIZATION>Twitter API</ORGANIZATION> returns 100 tweets every time it is called the timespan for each of the fetched datasets containing 100 tweets varies For instance some of our sample 100 tweets are posted in a timespan as short as less than three minutes while some others are posted in over 40 minutes This disparity can result in inconsistencies that need to be addressed in analysis as we did but makes some time specific analyses more difficult and less reliable Another limitation in this study was that since we had a two phase data collection with almost a year interval some of the spammers from our original list of spammers were already identified and removed by Twitter and thus we had to exclude them from our network analysis because no information about their friendships was available or could be fetched at the time of analysis In at least one instance the same account handle was used by a new user after the original account had been deleted by Twitter we discovered this from the date of creation of the account Friendship relationships might also have been changed during the data collection time interval but we considered this insignificant in our network analysis In this study we focused on what users were doing and how they acted or reacted to each other on social media However there are some directions for future research that could enhance our understanding of social networks Including affiliations in the analysis Looking into the accounts that operate together and in the same time intervals could be useful in some instances For instance the network might be composed of some subnetworks and this affiliation analysis could open a window to new understandings of network structure In our sampled data we might look into datasets and try to figure out which accounts usually appeared together on the sampled tweet decks Unfortunately the sampling by <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> places a barrier on the extent to which this information can be elicited Therefore although a great way of finding out more about an unknown network of actors an analysis of affiliation networks cannot result in any significant findings in our datasets in this study However if the full datasets were representatively sampled and coded for spam it added value Including reactions in the analysis All activities other than tweeting could also be considered for the analysis For instance marking tweets as favorite retweeting or mentioning were not part of this study due to a lack of data again resulted from limitations and restrictions of Twitter s free API Also one thing that was less common was that some of these users copied the exact content of another user s tweet instead of simply retweeting it These reactions if studied could add to our understanding of how these accounts were related and how they interacted with each other More rigorous spammer detection algorithms While we had limited our detection of spammer accounts to the coding of tweets and flagged a user as a spammer only if they had five or more tweets that were identified as spam there could have been some alternatives for identifying spammers even if they did not meet this study s criteria For instance as we described in the findings some users were as active in posting a tweet every five seconds and some were responsible for a great majority of the total tweets that were recorded in some datasets Although most of these users were already recorded as spammers in our datasets more criteria could have given us a richer list of spammers Expanding spammer detection criteria to friendships and reactions Another spammer detection practice could be that once a tweet was marked as a spam users who reacted to that tweet were placed on a list of potential spammers and watched for spammer like behavior This can be a greedier algorithm for spammer detection The same logic could also apply to friendship relationships for an account already been identified as a spammer In these cases once a potential spammer is associated with sufficient red flags that actor is then labeled as a spammer Once this decision has been reached the same analysis can be done for that user s tweets and or friends to identify new potential spammers in the pool Other network analysis techniques There are also other social network analysis techniques that a researcher might find useful such as block model and positional analysis to find if a network has positional equivalences to the network positions each of the actors have transitivity analysis and clustering coefficient to find more about indirect friendships among users network partitioning and clustering to find the most influential actors in terms of keeping the network connected and so on An interesting issue for future research relates to the perception of disengaging tweets as we call spam here by Twitter users We noticed that while some users are more inclusive in their definition of what they would consider as spam other users have a much narrower definition of such i e they might find a tweet disengaging and perceive it as spam while another use might accept a loose connection between the tweet and the hashtag it was posted with In this study we used a clear two step criterion which we believe helped us keep false positive detections to a minimum A survey of different social media users could help in understanding inclusiveness choices and find out how they become distractions while users are following trending news and updates There also seems to be a growing interest in terrorist groups and violent organizations that employ social media capabilities to support their activities <PERSON>Bodine Baron</PERSON> et al 2016 This calls for further study on the subject to connect hashtag spoiling behavior to known ways terrorist organizations and violent groups use social media to better understand different possible aspects of the problem and help social media platforms and users mitigate the impact of such activities With more information on hand about the situations in which this spamming behavior is likely to take place and with sufficient samples to give a good sense of how these spamming behaviors occur and spam tweets appear unsupervised machine learning algorithms could be employed to detect them This could be beneficial for social media applications that want to identify and block spammers in order to allow users legitimately take advantage of social platform capabilities image bookmark p7 7 Concluding remarks In this paper we presented our findings from a research on organized distributed hashtag spoiling activity in Twitter We used <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> data to show relationships between accounts responsible for high frequency and disengaging tweets in a sample of recorded tweets coded based on a two step mechanism and stringent criteria We employed social media tools and techniques to show the cohesive subgroups and seniority in the network of relationships We analyzed the micro social network composed of dyadic connections between the accounts responsible for tweets marked as spam in our sample Although we analyzed a small and assumingly non representative sample of all such account spoiling using this hashtag we believe this analysis can at least be a proof of concept in case it actually revealed evidence of some meaningful relationships between these accounts The results illustrate that organized hashtag spoiling is actually taking place in some instances and due to the context we believe political motivations could be its main cause Knowing about networked relationships among spammer accounts makes their tweeting patterns and similarities in demographics more meaningful We can now assert that these accounts belong to individuals in organizations who had a planned mandate of spoiling the IranTalks hashtag In the context of our IranTalks case study a few insights and observations stand out First insofar as we have demonstrated that hashtag spoiling around IranTalks has proven to be an organized campaign with the goal of disengaging Twitter users from following news related to the nuclear negotiations this case clearly falls under the domain of hacktivism The patterns of behavior that were undertaken by the hashtag spoilers were disruptive though non destructive and while they may have violated <ORGANIZATION>Twitter</ORGANIZATION> s terms of service agreement were not overtly criminal Second the case of the IranTalks hashtag may signal a new evolutionary step in hacktivism In the past hacktivists deployed their tactics and disruptive acumen in order to draw attention to their political causes or to amplify a particular voice to influence public opinion in some way What makes this case different is that a similar methodology was applied but in a way that resulted in a different effect namely user distraction The goal of user distraction is a marked shift away from the goal of political expression This is not only significant in its own right but also could potentially serve to shift public opinion and additionally reshape how researchers contextualize the role of spam botnets collective blocklists online collective actions and a host of other objectives of study on this front Third in the hopes of being prescriptive IranTalks also highlights the ever increasing importance of algorithms as a meta regulator As hashtag spoiling and wider campaigns that target user distraction become more prevalent on social media platforms their effects can only be mitigated through better detection algorithms Consequently those algorithms their technical design and their potential politicization become central to this discussion image End of article bookmark author About the authors <PERSON>Mahdi M Najafabadi</PERSON>
