Day April 10 2018 poem About this Poem I suspect that worrying is a large and ongoing part of the human experience but I also try to pretend like I don t do it I suppose this is a poem in which I

my friends will misunderstand my silence as a lack of love or interest instead of a tent city built for my own mind I worry I can no longer pretend enough to get through another year of pretending I

cloaked I am an immediate symbol of a war folks have been fighting eons deep before I was born a meteor Copyright 2018 by <ORGANIZATION>Tarfia Faizullah Originally</ORGANIZATION> published in Poem a
