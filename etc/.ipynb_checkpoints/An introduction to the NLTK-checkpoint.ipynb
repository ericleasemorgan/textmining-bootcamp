In these cases, simply read the error messages and follow the instructions. \"Your mileage may vary.\"\n",

      "in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay\n",
      "up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer's life,\n",
      "even if he is not encumbered with a family- estimating the pecuniary\n",
      "value of every man's labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive\n",
      "more, others receive less;- so that he must have spent more than\n",

      "  Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to\n",
      "the woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my\n",
      "house, and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in\n",
      "their youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing,\n",

      "pleasant hillside where I worked, covered with pine woods, through\n",
      "which I looked out on the pond, and a small open field in the woods\n",
      "where pines and hickories were springing up. The ice in the pond was\n",
      "not yet dissolved, though there were some open spaces, and it was\n",
      "all dark-colored and saturated with water. There were some slight\n",
      "flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; but for the most\n",
      "part when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow\n",
      "sand-heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the\n",
      "rails shone in the spring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and\n",
      "other birds already come to commence another year with us. They were\n",
      "pleasant spring days, in which the winter of man's discontent was\n",
      "thawing as well as the earth, and the life that had lain torpid\n",
      "began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe had come off and I had\n",
      "cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had\n",
      "placed the whole to soak in a pond-hole in order to swell the wood,\n",
      "I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom,\n",
      "apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more\n",
      "than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not yet fairly\n",
      "come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a like reason\n",
      "men remain in their present low and primitive condition; but if they\n",
      "should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them, they\n",
      "would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life. I had\n",
      "previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions\n",
      "of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun to thaw\n",
      "them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in the\n",
      "early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose\n",

      "more the friend than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down\n",
      "some of them, having become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a\n",

      "dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be\n",
      "seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around as if it were a\n",
      "compost heap. The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal\n",
      "warped and made brittle by the sun. Doorsill there was none, but a\n",
      "perennial passage for the hens under the door-board. Mrs. C. came to\n",
      "the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven\n",

      "part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board\n",

      "under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of\n",
      "dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were good boards\n",
      "overhead, good boards all around, and a good window\"- of two whole\n",
      "squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There\n",
      "was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where\n",
      "it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent\n",
      "new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was\n",
      "soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four\n",
      "dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow\n",
      "morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at\n",

      "certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground\n",
      "rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I\n",

      "than I. They are destined, I trust, to assist at the raising of\n",
      "loftier structures one day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of\n",
      "July, as soon as it was boarded and roofed, for the boards were\n",
      "carefully feather-edged and lapped, so that it was perfectly\n",
      "impervious to rain, but before boarding I laid the foundation of a\n",
      "chimney at one end, bringing two cartloads of stones up the hill\n",

      "which mode I still think is in some respects more convenient and\n",
      "agreeable than the usual one. When it stormed before my bread was\n",
      "baked, I fixed a few boards over the fire, and sat under them to watch\n",
      "my loaf, and passed some pleasant hours in that way. In those days,\n",

      "usually bathed again in the pond, swimming across one of its coves for\n",
      "a stint, and washed the dust of labor from my person, or smoothed\n",
      "out the last wrinkle which study had made, and for the afternoon was\n",
      "absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear\n",
      "some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating\n",
      "either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which,\n",
      "taken in homeopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the\n",
      "rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to\n",
      "see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men\n",
      "and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts\n",
      "rattle. In one direction from my house there was a colony of\n",
      "muskrats in the river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods\n",
      "in the other horizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me as if\n",
      "they had been prairie-dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow,\n",
      "or running over to a neighbor's to gossip. I went there frequently\n",
      "to observe their habits. The village appeared to me a great news room;\n",
      "and on one side, to support it, as once at Redding & Company's on\n",
      "State Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other\n",
      "groceries. Some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity,\n",
      "that is, the news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can\n",
      "sit forever in public avenues without stirring, and let it simmer\n",
      "and whisper through them like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling\n",
      "ether, it only producing numbness and insensibility to pain- otherwise\n",
      "it would often be painful to bear- without affecting the\n",
      "consciousness. I hardly ever failed, when I rambled through the\n",
      "village, to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a ladder\n",
      "sunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their\n",
      "eyes glancing along the line this way and that, from time to time,\n",
      "with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning against a barn with\n",
      "their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as if to prop it up.\n",
      "They, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was in the wind.\n",
      "These are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is first rudely\n",
      "digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more\n",
      "delicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the\n",
      "village were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank;\n",
      "and, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big\n",
      "gun, and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so\n",
      "arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one\n",
      "another, so that every traveller had to run the gauntlet, and every\n",
      "man, woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who\n",
      "were stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could\n",
      "most see and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest\n",
      "prices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the\n",
      "outskirts, where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the\n",
      "traveller could get over walls or turn aside into cow-paths, and so\n",
      "escape, paid a very slight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out\n",
      "on all sides to allure him; some to catch him by the appetite, as\n",
      "the tavern and victualling cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods\n",
      "store and the jeweller's; and others by the hair or the feet or the\n",
      "skirts, as the barber, the shoe-maker, or the tailor. Besides, there\n",
      "was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one\n",
      "of these houses, and company expected about these times. For the\n",
      "most part I escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by\n",

      "praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and\n",
      "kept out of danger.\" Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could\n",
      "tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about gracefulness,\n",
      "and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even accustomed to make\n",
      "an irruption into some houses, where I was well entertained, and after\n",
      "learning the kernels and very last sieveful of news- what had\n",
      "subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether the world was\n",

      "mile off through the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or\n",
      "two after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater\n",

      "till toward morning, by which time, as there had been several heavy\n",
      "showers in the meanwhile, and the leaves were very wet, they were\n",
      "drenched to their skins. I have heard of many going astray even in the\n",

      "half a mile out of their way, feeling the sidewalk only with their\n",
      "feet, and not knowing when they turned. It is a surprising and\n",
      "memorable, as well as valuable experience, to be lost in the woods any\n",

      "and fifty feet respectively, within a quarter and a third of a mile.\n",
      "They are exclusively woodland. All our Concord waters have two\n",
      "colors at least; one when viewed at a distance, and another, more\n",
      "proper, close at hand. The first depends more on the light, and\n",
      "follows the sky. In clear weather, in summer, they appear blue at a\n",
      "little distance, especially if agitated, and at a great distance all\n",
      "appear alike. In stormy weather they are sometimes of a dark\n",
      "slate-color. The sea, however, is said to be blue one day and green\n",
      "another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere. I have\n",
      "seen our river, when, the landscape being covered with snow, both\n",
      "water and ice were almost as green as grass. Some consider blue \"to be\n",
      "the color of pure water, whether liquid or solid.\" But, looking\n",
      "directly down into our waters from a boat, they are seen to be of very\n",
      "different colors. Walden is blue at one time and green at another,\n",
      "even from the same point of view. Lying between the earth and the\n",
      "heavens, it partakes of the color of both. Viewed from a hilltop it\n",

      "tint next the shore where you can see the sand, then a light green,\n",
      "which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the\n",
      "pond. In some lights, viewed even from a hilltop, it is of a vivid\n",
      "green next the shore. Some have referred this to the reflection of the\n",
      "verdure; but it is equally green there against the railroad\n",
      "sandbank, and in the spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it\n",
      "may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the\n",
      "yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This is that\n",
      "portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the heat\n",
      "of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through the\n",
      "earth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen\n",
      "middle. Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear\n",
      "weather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the\n",
      "right angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it\n",
      "appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and\n",
      "at such a time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision,\n",
      "so as to see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and\n",
      "indescribable light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and\n",
      "sword blades suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating\n",
      "with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which\n",
      "last appeared but muddy in comparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue,\n",
      "as I remember it, like those patches of the winter sky seen through\n",
      "cloud vistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its\n",
      "water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of\n",
      "air. It is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green\n",
      "tint, owing, as the makers say, to its \"body,\" but a small piece of\n",
      "the same will be colorless. How large a body of Walden water would\n",
      "be required to reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water\n",
      "of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly\n",
      "down on it, and, like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one\n",
      "bathing in it a yellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline\n",
      "purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster\n",

      "seven feet; and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is\n",
      "insignificant in amount, and this overflow must be referred to\n",
      "causes which affect the deep springs. This same summer the pond has\n",
      "begun to fall again. It is remarkable that this fluctuation, whether\n",
      "periodical or not, appears thus to require many years for its\n",
      "accomplishment. I have observed one rise and a part of two falls,\n",
      "and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will\n",

      "  This rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at\n",
      "least; the water standing at this great height for a year or more,\n",
      "though it makes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and\n",
      "trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise- pitch\n",
      "pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others- and, falling again, leaves\n",
      "an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters which are\n",
      "subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water is\n",
      "lowest. On the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pines,\n",
      "fifteen feet high, has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever,\n",
      "and thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates\n",
      "how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By\n",
      "this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the\n",
      "shore is shorn, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession.\n",
      "These are the lips of the lake, on which no beard grows. It licks\n",
      "its chaps from time to time. When the water is at its height, the\n",
      "alders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots\n",
      "several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to\n",
      "the height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to\n",
      "maintain themselves; and I have known the high blueberry bushes\n",

      "Indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high\n",
      "into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they\n",
      "used much profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of\n",
      "which the Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus\n",
      "engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw,\n",
      "named Walden, escaped, and from her the pond was named. It has been\n",
      "conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side\n",
      "and became the present shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that\n",
      "once there was no pond here, and now there is one; and this Indian\n",
      "fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that\n",
      "ancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he\n",
      "first came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor rising from\n",
      "the sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded\n",
      "to dig a well here. As for the stones, many still think that they\n",
      "are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these\n",
      "hills; but I observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of\n",
      "the same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them\n",
      "up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond; and,\n",
      "moreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so\n",
      "that, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me. I detect the\n",
      "paver. If the name was not derived from that of some English locality-\n",
      "Saffron Walden, for instance- one might suppose that it was called\n",
      "originally Walled-in Pond.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its\n",
      "water is as cold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is\n",
      "then as good as any, if not the best, in the town. In the winter,\n",
      "all water which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells\n",
      "which are protected from it. The temperature of the pond water which\n",
      "had stood in the room where I sat from five o'clock in the afternoon\n",

      "tried, though it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when,\n",
      "beside, shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it.\n",
      "Moreover, in summer, Walden never becomes so warm as most water\n",
      "which is exposed to the sun, on account of its depth. In the warmest\n",
      "weather I usually placed a pailful in my cellar, where it became\n",
      "cool in the night, and remained so during the day; though I also\n",
      "resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as good when a week\n",
      "old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the pump. Whoever\n",
      "camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs only bury a\n",

      "because he did not see him- perch and pouts, some of each weighing\n",
      "over two pounds, shiners, chivins or roach (Leuciscus pulchellus), a\n",

      "long, with silvery sides and a greenish back, somewhat dace-like in\n",
      "its character, which I mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable.\n",
      "Nevertheless, this pond is not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel,\n",
      "though not abundant, are its chief boast. I have seen at one time\n",
      "lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds: a long\n",
      "and shallow one, steel-colored, most like those caught in the river; a\n",
      "bright golden kind, with greenish reflections and remarkably deep,\n",
      "which is the most common here; and another, golden-colored, and shaped\n",
      "like the last, but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or\n",
      "black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones, very much\n",
      "like a trout. The specific name reticulatus would not apply to this;\n",
      "it should be guttatus rather. These are all very firm fish, and\n",
      "weigh more than their size promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch\n",
      "also, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond, are much\n",
      "cleaner, handsomer, and firmer-fleshed than those in the river and\n",
      "most other ponds, as the water is purer, and they can easily be\n",
      "distinguished from them. Probably many ichthyologists would make new\n",
      "varieties of some of them. There are also a clean race of frogs and\n",
      "tortoises, and a few mussels in it; muskrats and minks leave their\n",
      "traces about it, and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it.\n",
      "Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the morning, I disturbed a\n",
      "great mud-turtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the\n",
      "night. Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall, the\n",
      "white-bellied swallows (Hirundo bicolor) skim over it, and the\n",
      "peetweets (Totanus macularius) \"teeter\" along its stony shores all\n",

      "purpose, and so, when the ice melted, they sank to the bottom; but\n",
      "they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that. They\n",
      "are similar to those found in rivers; but as there are no suckers\n",
      "nor lampreys here, I know not by what fish they could be made. Perhaps\n",

      "northern, and the beautifully scalloped southern shore, where\n",
      "successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves\n",
      "between. The forest has never so good a setting, nor is so\n",
      "distinctly beautiful, as when seen from the middle of a small lake\n",
      "amid hills which rise from the water's edge; for the water in which it\n",
      "is reflected not only makes the best foreground in such a case, but,\n",
      "with its winding shore, the most natural and agreeable boundary to it.\n",
      "There is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there, as where the\n",
      "axe has cleared a part, or a cultivated field abuts on it. The trees\n",
      "have ample room to expand on the water side, and each sends forth\n",
      "its most vigorous branch in that direction. There Nature has woven a\n",
      "natural selvage, and the eye rises by just gradations from the low\n",
      "shrubs of the shore to the highest trees. There are few traces of\n",
      "man's hand to be seen. The water laves the shore as it did a\n",

      "a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and\n",
      "gleaming against the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the\n",
      "atmosphere from another. You would think that you could walk dry under\n",
      "it to the opposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over\n",
      "might perch on it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as\n",
      "it were by mistake, and are undeceived. As you look over the pond\n",
      "westward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes\n",
      "against the reflected as well as the true sun, for they are equally\n",
      "bright; and if, between the two, you survey its surface critically, it\n",

      "the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance,\n",
      "a duck plumes itself, or, as I have said, a swallow skims so low as to\n",
      "touch it. It may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of\n",
      "three or four feet in the air, and there is one bright flash where\n",
      "it emerges, and another where it strikes the water; sometimes the\n",
      "whole silvery arc is revealed; or here and there, perhaps, is a\n",
      "thistle-down floating on its surface, which the fishes dart at and\n",

      "the water nymphs, resting on it. From a hilltop you can see a fish\n",
      "leap in almost any part; for not a pickerel or shiner picks an\n",
      "insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the\n",
      "equilibrium of the whole lake. It is wonderful with what elaborateness\n",
      "this simple fact is advertised- this piscine murder will out- and from\n",

      "without rippling it perceptibly. When the surface is considerably\n",
      "agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it, but apparently, in\n",
      "calm days, they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth\n",
      "from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it. It\n",
      "is a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall when\n",
      "all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump on\n",
      "such a height as this, overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling\n",

      "in the green water, sporting there, and constantly rising to the\n",
      "surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it. In such\n",
      "transparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the clouds, I\n",
      "seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and their\n",
      "swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they were\n",
      "a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or\n",
      "left, their fins, like sails, set all around them. There were many\n",

      "winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight,\n",
      "sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze\n",
      "struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached\n",
      "carelessly and alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling\n",
      "with their tails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy\n",
      "bough, and instantly took refuge in the depths. At length the wind\n",
      "rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch\n",
      "leaped much higher than before, half out of water, a hundred black\n",
      "points, three inches long, at once above the surface. Even as late\n",

      "that there were many eagles about it. He came here a-fishing, and used\n",
      "an old log canoe which he found on the shore. It was made of two white\n",

      "the stumps of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly\n",
      "fastened in the sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the\n",

      "inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any\n",
      "kind. It is a significant fact, stated by entomologists- I find it\n",

      "perhaps this may be done. The fruits eaten temperately need not make\n",

      "them. They suggest not merely the purity of infancy, but a wisdom\n",
      "clarified by experience. Such an eye was not born when the bird was,\n",

      "probably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an\n",
      "hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch,\n",

      "two large ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an\n",
      "inch long, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having\n",
      "once got hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled\n",
      "on the chips incessantly. Looking farther, I was surprised to find\n",
      "that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a\n",
      "duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always\n",
      "pitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black.\n",
      "The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my\n",
      "woodyard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying,\n",
      "both red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever\n",
      "witnessed, the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was\n",
      "raging; internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and\n",
      "the black imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged\n",
      "in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human\n",
      "soldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast\n",
      "locked in each other's embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the\n",
      "chips, now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down, or\n",
      "life went out. The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a\n",
      "vice to his adversary's front, and through all the tumblings on that\n",
      "field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near\n",
      "the root, having already caused the other to go by the board; while\n",
      "the stronger black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw\n",
      "on looking nearer, had already divested him of several of his members.\n",
      "They fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs. Neither manifested\n",
      "the least disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry\n",
      "was \"Conquer or die.\" In the meanwhile there came along a single red\n",
      "ant on the hillside of this valley, evidently full of excitement,\n",
      "who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the\n",
      "battle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs;\n",
      "whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it.\n",
      "Or perchance he was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath\n",
      "apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this\n",
      "unequal combat from afar- for the blacks were nearly twice the size of\n",
      "the red- he drew near with rapid pace till be stood on his guard\n",
      "within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity,\n",
      "he sprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near\n",
      "the root of his right fore leg, leaving the foe to select among his\n",
      "own members; and so there were three united for life, as if a new kind\n",
      "of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and\n",
      "cements to shame. I should not have wondered by this time to find that\n",
      "they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent\n",
      "chip, and playing their national airs the while, to excite the slow\n",
      "and cheer the dying combatants. I was myself excited somewhat even\n",
      "as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the\n",
      "difference. And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord\n",

      "moment's comparison with this, whether for the numbers engaged in\n",
      "it, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed. For numbers and for\n",
      "carnage it was an Austerlitz or Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed\n",
      "on the patriots' side, and Luther Blanchard wounded! Why here every\n",

      "would take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface\n",
      "this time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he\n",
      "laughed long and loud, and with more reason than before. He manoeuvred\n",
      "so cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him.\n",
      "Each time, when he came to the surface, turning his head this way\n",
      "and that, he cooly surveyed the water and the land, and apparently\n",

      "expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat. It was\n",
      "surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into\n",
      "execution. He led me at once to the widest part of the pond, and could\n",
      "not be driven from it. While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I\n",
      "was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game,\n",
      "played on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against a loon.\n",
      "Suddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and\n",
      "the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear\n",
      "again. Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of\n",
      "me, having apparently passed directly under the boat. So long-winded\n",
      "was he and so unweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would\n",
      "immediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine\n",
      "where in the deep pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be\n",
      "speeding his way like a fish, for he had time and ability to visit the\n",
      "bottom of the pond in its deepest part. It is said that loons have\n",
      "been caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface,\n",
      "with hooks set for trout- though Walden is deeper than that. How\n",
      "surprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another\n",
      "sphere speeding his way amid their schools! Yet he appeared to know\n",
      "his course as surely under water as on the surface, and swam much\n",
      "faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple where he approached the\n",
      "surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre, and instantly dived\n",
      "again. I found that it was as well for me to rest on my oars and\n",
      "wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would\n",
      "rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over the\n",
      "surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh\n",

      "invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh?\n",
      "Did not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly\n",
      "loon, I thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he\n",
      "came up, and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as\n",
      "fresh as ever, dived as willingly, and swam yet farther than at first.\n",
      "It was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled\n",
      "breast when he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed\n",
      "feet beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet\n",
      "somewhat like that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had\n",
      "balked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a\n",
      "long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than\n",
      "any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and\n",
      "deliberately howls. This was his looning- perhaps the wildest sound\n",
      "that is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I\n",
      "concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of\n",
      "his own resources. Though the sky was by this time overcast, the\n",
      "pond was so smooth that I could see where he broke the surface when\n",
      "I did not hear him. His white breast, the stillness of the air, and\n",
      "the smoothness of the water were all against him. At length having\n",
      "come up fifty rods off, he uttered one of those prolonged howls, as if\n",
      "calling on the god of loons to aid him, and immediately there came a\n",
      "wind from the east and rippled the surface, and filled the whole air\n",
      "with misty rain, and I was impressed as if it were the prayer of the\n",
      "loon answered, and his god was angry with me; and so I left him\n",

      "or in thin flakes, as if occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the\n",
      "ice was gone, and it was too late to study the bottom. Being curious\n",
      "to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new\n",
      "ice, I broke out a cake containing a middling sized one, and turned it\n",
      "bottom upward. The new ice had formed around and under the bubble,\n",
      "so that it was included between the two ices. It was wholly in the\n",
      "lower ice, but close against the upper, and was flattish, or perhaps\n",
      "slightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by\n",
      "four inches in diameter; and I was surprised to find that directly\n",
      "under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the\n",
      "form of a saucer reversed, to the height of five eighths of an inch in\n",
      "the middle, leaving a thin partition there between the water and the\n",
      "bubble, hardly an eighth of an inch thick; and in many places the\n",
      "small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward, and probably\n",
      "there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles, which were a foot\n",
      "in diameter. I inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles\n",
      "which I had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now\n",
      "frozen in likewise, and that each, in its degree, had operated like\n",

      "without fear. I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a\n",

      "to his old haunts, where the hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he\n",
      "will run upon a wall many rods, and then leap off far to one side, and\n",
      "he appears to know that water will not retain his scent. A hunter told\n",
      "me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden\n",
      "when the ice was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across,\n",
      "and then return to the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but\n",
      "here they lost the scent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would\n",
      "pass my door, and circle round my house, and yelp and hound without\n",
      "regarding me, as if afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing\n",
      "could divert them from the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall\n",
      "upon the recent trail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake\n",
      "everything else for this. One day a man came to my hut from\n",

      "had been hunting for a week by himself. But I fear that he was not the\n",

      "full pursuit, hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in\n",
      "the woods. Late in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods\n",
      "south of Walden, he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair\n",

      "Well Meadow, now from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood still\n",
      "and listened to their music, so sweet to a hunter's ear, when suddenly\n",
      "the fox appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing\n",
      "pace, whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves,\n",
      "swift and still, keeping the round, leaving his pursuers far behind;\n",
      "and, leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening,\n",
      "with his back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the\n",
      "latter's arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought\n",
      "can follow thought his piece was levelled, and whang!- the fox,\n",
      "rolling over the rock, lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept\n",
      "his place and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now\n",
      "the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their\n",
      "demoniac cry. At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to\n",
      "the ground, and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly\n",
      "to the rock; but, spying the dead fox, she suddenly ceased her\n",
      "hounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked round and\n",
      "round him in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their\n",
      "mother, were sobered into silence by the mystery. Then the hunter came\n",
      "forward and stood in their midst, and the mystery was solved. They\n",
      "waited in silence while he skinned the fox, then followed the brush\n",
      "a while, and at length turned off into the woods again. That evening a\n",
      "Weston squire came to the Concord hunter's cottage to inquire for\n",
      "his hounds, and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own\n",
      "account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter told him what he knew\n",
      "and offered him the skin; but the other declined it and departed. He\n",
      "did not find his hounds that night, but the next day learned that they\n",

      "Norwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and deep, and they\n",
      "were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other\n",
      "diet. These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at\n",
      "midsummer, and many of them had grown a foot, though completely\n",
      "girdled; but after another winter such were without exception dead. It\n",
      "is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole\n",
      "pine tree for its dinner, gnawing round instead of up and down it; but\n",

      "they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces\n",
      "from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor\n",
      "wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant\n",
      "tail and slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained\n",
      "the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes\n",
      "appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and lo,\n",
      "away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow-crust, straightening\n",
      "its body and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest\n",
      "between me and itself- the wild free venison, assenting its vigor\n",

      "with serene and satisfied face, and no question on her lips. I awoke\n",
      "to an answered question, to Nature and daylight. The snow lying deep\n",
      "on the earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of the hill\n",
      "on which my house is placed, seemed to say, Forward! Nature puts no\n",

      "\n",
      "  Then to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in\n",
      "search of water, if that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy\n",
      "night it needed a divining-rod to find it. Every winter the liquid and\n",
      "trembling surface of the pond, which was so sensitive to every breath,\n",
      "and reflected every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of\n",
      "a foot or a foot and a half, so that it will support the heaviest\n",
      "teams, and perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth, and it is\n",
      "not to be distinguished from any level field. Like the marmots in\n",
      "the surrounding hills, it closes its eyelids and becomes dormant for\n",
      "three months or more. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a\n",
      "pasture amid the hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and\n",
      "then a foot of ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling\n",

      "a softened light as through a window of ground glass, with its\n",
      "bright sanded floor the same as in summer; there a perennial\n",
      "waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky, corresponding\n",

      "those instances which we detect; but the harmony which results from\n",

      "powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole, and then putting a\n",

      "fluctuation, when observed by means of a level on land directed toward\n",
      "a graduated staff on the ice, was three quarters of an inch, though\n",
      "the ice appeared firmly attached to the shore. It was probably greater\n",
      "in the middle. Who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough\n",
      "we might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth? When two legs\n",
      "of my level were on the shore and the third on the ice, and the sights\n",
      "were directed over the latter, a rise or fall of the ice of an\n",
      "almost infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a\n",
      "tree across the pond. When I began to cut holes for sounding there\n",
      "were three or four inches of water on the ice under a deep snow\n",
      "which had sunk it thus far; but the water began immediately to run\n",
      "into these holes, and continued to run for two days in deep streams,\n",
      "which wore away the ice on every side, and contributed essentially, if\n",
      "not mainly, to dry the surface of the pond; for, as the water ran\n",
      "in, it raised and floated the ice. This was somewhat like cutting a\n",
      "hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out. When such holes\n",
      "freeze, and a rain succeeds, and finally a new freezing forms a\n",
      "fresh smooth ice over all, it is beautifully mottled internally by\n",

      "ice rosettes, produced by the channels worn by the water flowing\n",
      "from all sides to a centre. Sometimes, also, when the ice was\n",

      "crack in the ground down toward Tartarus, and he who was so brave\n",
      "before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man, almost gave up his\n",

      "  To speak literally, a hundred Irishmen, with Yankee overseers,\n",

      "being sledded to the shore, were rapidly hauled off on to an ice\n",
      "platform, and raised by grappling irons and block and tackle, worked\n",
      "by horses, on to a stack, as surely as so many barrels of flour, and\n",

      "cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets. They stacked up the cakes thus\n",
      "in the open air in a pile thirty-five feet high on one side and six or\n",
      "seven rods square, putting hay between the outside layers to exclude\n",
      "the air; for when the wind, though never so cold, finds a passage\n",
      "through, it will wear large cavities, leaving slight supports or studs\n",
      "only here and there, and finally topple it down. At first it looked\n",
      "like a vast blue fort or Valhalla; but when they began to tuck the\n",
      "coarse meadow hay into the crevices, and this became covered with rime\n",
      "and icicles, it looked like a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin,\n",

      "its destination, and that two or three per cent would be wasted in the\n",

      "found not to keep so well as was expected, containing more air than\n",
      "usual, or for some other reason, it never got to market. This heap,\n",
      "made in the winter of '46-7 and estimated to contain ten thousand\n",

      "unroofed the following July, and a part of it carried off, the rest\n",
      "remaining exposed to the sun, it stood over that summer and the next\n",

      "February 24th, 1850, having gone to Flint's Pond to spend the day, I\n",
      "noticed with surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of\n",

      "slanted upon it from over the hills; it stretched itself and yawned\n",
      "like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult, which was kept\n",
      "up three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon, and boomed\n",
      "once more toward night, as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In\n",

      "as in rivers, but, though it was completely melted for half a rod in\n",
      "width about the shore, the middle was merely honeycombed and saturated\n",
      "with water, so that you could put your foot through it when six inches\n",

      "followed by fog, it would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with\n",
