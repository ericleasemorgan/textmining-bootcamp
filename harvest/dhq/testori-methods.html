                <p>Despite being also known as the “Father of Digital Humanities” owing to his
                    pioneering contribution to the application of informatics to the whole ensemble
                    of texts by the medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274),
                    the Jesuit Italian priest Roberto Busa (1913-2011) has still not been fully
                    appreciated with regard to his development of a “hermeneutic informatics”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1999">Busa 1999</a>, 5]. Indeed this may represent a key concept to clarify what makes a
                    difference between the common usage of computers in order to speed up
                    procedures, and high-quality practices enhancing the role of informatics in
                    shaping human interaction with machines. In other terms, Busa’s interpretation
                    of informatics may impact not only on the way in which digital resources and
                    tools are developed, but also on the epistemological reflection about Digital
                    Humanities. In this paper, by drawing from many of his texts, I will outline how
                    this innovative “hermeneutics” is explained by Busa in terms of language
                    dynamisms potentially leading to the development of what Johanna Drucker has
                    described as a “humanistic-informed theory of the making of
                            technology”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#drucker2012">Drucker 2012</a>, 87].</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="testori-methods.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In his article titled “What is humanities computing and what is
                    not?”, John Unsworth suggests looking at humanities computing “as a practice of representation”
                     [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#unsworth">Unsworth</a>], which he has articulated according to six propositions, among which are
                those concerning “humanities computing as a way of
                    reasoning” and “humanities computing as shaped by the
                    need for human communication”. The basis for these suggestions outlined
                in 2002 may be found in the article “What is a Knowledge
                    Representation?” by Randall Davis, Howard Shrobe and Peter Szolovits,
                which appeared around a decade before in <cite class="title italic">Al Magazine</cite>
                and in the light of which Unsworth has developed his considerations: in this
                contribution, in fact, the authors have reasoned about the features of knowledge
                representation, which, among others, they have defined as “a set
                    of ontological commitments”, “a medium for efficient
                    computation” and “a medium of human expression”
                     [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#davis1993">Davis, Shrobe, and Szolovits 1993</a>]. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="testori-methods.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">It is worth noticing that, with their discussion, Davis and colleagues have
                anticipated the current debates regarding what digital humanities is and, more
                specifically, the boundary between a generic, widespread use of computers to do
                things, and computer applications adding value to academic research in humanistic
                disciplines because of their capability of representing human knowledge more
                effectively. Interestingly, in the second half of the twentieth century Roberto Busa
                (1913-2011), the groundbreaking developer of the <cite class="title italic">Index
                    Thomisticus</cite><a class="noteRef" href="testori-methods.html#d27422e235">[1]</a>, a linguistic corpus for Thomas Aquinas' texts, already proposed ideas with
                the potential to enlighten and steer the contemporary discussion in the field.
                Although Busa is known for having been one of the early pioneers to bring problems
                in language together with computing machinery, his contribution to the development
                of a “hermeneutic informatics”<a class="noteRef" href="testori-methods.html#d27422e243">[2]</a> is not so appreciated and recognised. There is the risk of pigeonholing his
                work under constraining labels or confining it only to specific sectors (for
                example, computing techniques applied to ancient languages). It appears to me
                significant, instead, that, since he worked on the development of a linguistic
                corpus, Busa established in this way a vital connection between humanities computing
                and the reflection on language. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="testori-methods.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">In this article, I am going to outline the salient ideas put into practice by Busa by
                discussing some of his contributions as a common thread. It is not a coincidence
                that in 1998 Busa admonished that “Informatics is already an ocean”
                     [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1999">Busa 1999</a>], so we need to be careful not to get lost. For this reason, I also propose
                many quotations from Busa's texts as a deliberate choice to let the reader know many
                worthy reflections provided by the scientist that are not so well-known so as to
                stimulate a debate. At the same time, I will be pointing out how my current
                experience of work on Busa’s legacy is leading me to move ahead with the development
                of new perspectives requiring further consideration. </div>

                <h1 class="head">Methods of quality: Roberto Busa and the computing in the humanities</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="testori-methods.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In his keynote speech <cite class="title italic">From Punched Cards to Treebanks: 60
                        Years of Computational Linguistics</cite> at the Eighth International
                    Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories (Milan, 2009), Busa sketched three
                    main typologies of informatics currently in use: “documentaristic” informatics, comprising all the informatic services
                    allowing efficient “information retrieval”; “editorial” informatics, referring to the wide range of
                        “multimedia” devices for reading books, watching
                    films, browsing the Internet; and “hermeneutic
                        informatics”, considering the “computerized text analysis, or language hermeneutics,
                            i.e. interpretation, […] of all our ways of questioning the <span class="hi italic">whys</span> of language”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1999">Busa 1999</a>, 5]. This latter was the informatic typology to which Busa devoted his
                    inexhaustible attention during all his life. The focus on language, according to
                    him, is strictly required by the nature of the relationships between man and
                    computers, which interact by means of specific programming codes. Moreover, “the computer allows and exigently demands, as its
                            specific capacities, an exhaustive, detailed, deep, quantitative
                            knowledge, derived from huge amounts of natural texts”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1999">Busa 1999</a>, 6]. As a consequence, it is arguable that computers and human beings,
                    technological devices and humanities are not competitors or antagonists, but
                    they are potential allies, insofar as they both are “human expressions”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1999">Busa 1999</a>, 6]. Nevertheless, what do we really know about the language (our language)
                    on which human communication is based and by which it is conveyed? Are we really
                    aware of the intrinsic logic, the inner dynamism, and the psychological
                    implications which are put in motion every time we communicate? Roberto Busa
                    defined the “language that [is] unknown”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1999">Busa 1999</a>, 6]<a class="noteRef" href="testori-methods.html#d27422e331">[3]</a>, as
                    signifying that establishing an interaction with the computer/machine implies a
                    more profound level of language awareness than that to which we are accustomed.
                    This raising of consciousness is necessary to introduce consolidated
                    philological and linguistic methods to the “new qualitative dimensions”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1980">Busa 1980</a>] made available by informatics. In the light of this, applying computer
                    methods to the humanities “can help us to be more humanistic than before”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#busa1980">Busa 1980</a>, 89] because it leads us, first, to an inner journey through rational paths
                    triggered by language expression. This conviction mirrors the current debate
                    regarding the necessity of an epistemological reflection on the making of the
                    digital humanities: for example, Stephen Ramsay and Geoffrey Rockwell have
                    recently stated that “the understanding of underlying theoretical claims is
                            the <span class="foreign i">sine qua non</span> of humanistic
                            enquiry”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#ramsay2012">Ramsay and Rockwell 2012</a>]. Roberto Busa would have certainly confirmed this vision and reasserted
                    that these “underlying theoretical claims” primarily
                    involve language dynamisms and linguistic issues. More specifically, these
                    underlying implications concern the meaning, the “semantics” of words and sentences, which is not attainable by a mere
                    quantitative production of a certain amount of data. Busa claimed that “we do not speak in words but in sentences. A sentence
                            has a global meaning which is not the pure sum of the values of its
                            single components. The heart of this problem is whether we are able to
                            formalise the global meaning of sentences with something less than the
                            whole sentence itself; in other words, whether we can succeed in
                            identifying in each sentence something which can be taken as
                            characteristic of its global meaning”

                    humanities should be focused on an accurate reflection on communication, because
                    man and computer interact with the help of sophisticated languages which differ
                    from common grammar and syntax and require constant development. Charles L.
                    Isbell et al. have confirmed the language-oriented nature of the interaction
                    established by human beings with the machine and suggested a reciprocal
                    shaping-power of the language on the outside reality (the computer) and,
                        <span class="foreign i">vice versa</span>, of the external world (the

                    communicative essence may contribute to illuminating a controversial point in
                    computing for the humanities: as Johanna Drucker has pointed out, “the challenge is to shift humanistic study from
                            attention to the <em class="emph">effects</em> of technology (from readings of
                            social media, games, narrative, personae, digital texts, images,
                            environments), to a humanistic-informed theory of the
                                <em class="emph">making</em> of technology”
                         [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#drucker2012">Drucker 2012</a>]. With respect to this question, Busa's message is that the development of
                    an “informed theory of the <em class="emph">making</em> of
                        technology” cannot elude a renewed, unremitting consideration of
                    language features and issues, which, in a kind of virtuous circle, are
                    positively related to the <em class="emph">effects</em> of technology on our life. In
                    this sense, the fruit sprouting from the “hermeneutic
                        informatics” to which Busa referred in his last keynote speech <cite class="title italic">From Punched Cards to Treebanks</cite> mentioned previously
                    is what I propose to indicate as a <em class="emph">language-based hermeneutics of

                    the IT-TB, in fact, has been increasingly persuading me about what I propose to

                    and, at the same time, I have been realizing how these insights can lead us
                    ahead of what Busa himself could not have completely foreseen. The most
                    intriguing fact of annotation of a treebank is that it enables the human
                    annotator to deal with a living, branching and constantly evolving tree. Making
                    a tree live, by establishing relations between words until it has reached its
                    accomplished form, is the amazing vocation I have discovered, since, in the very
                    act of annotating, I can make the text live. It really represents a kind of
                        “making of language,” to recall the title of the
                    book by Mike Beaken, <cite class="title italic">The Making of Language</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="testori-methods.html#beaken2011">Beaken 2011</a>], in which is proposed an alternative view of looking
                    at the origins of language, rooted not so much in biological features, rather
                    than in cultural and technological developments. Treebanks, in my vision,
                    represent one of these contemporary, worth exploring and pursuing developments,
                    made available by the advancements of linguistics not only for modern, but also
