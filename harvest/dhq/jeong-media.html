                <p>Interest in the role of book cover images in readers’ reading experience and book
                    marketing has been long-standing. This study attempts to compare book covers
                    from different countries with a media visualization tool called ImagePlot. The
                    top 100 bestselling books from 13 Amazon.com’s international sites were
                    identified and their cover images were downloaded. Using ImagePlot, median
                    values of brightness, hue and saturation for each image in the data set were
                    extracted and analyzed. Along with one-way ANOVA tests and the resulting graphs
                    from SPSS, ImagePlot outputs show differences in these graphical properties of
                    bestsellers’ cover images in different countries. From the outputs, with all the
                    book cover images displayed on a single canvas (screen), hidden patterns emerged
                    and findings were clearly confirmed. This study makes a contribution by
                    providing connection between research interests in book cover images and media
                    visualization techniques for further research.</p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="jeong-media.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Contrary to the real meaning of the English idiom, “Don’t judge a book by its
                        cover,” research interest in book covers has been steady ranging from the
                    personal book selection process to the marketing of trade books. For example,
                    there is an edited scholarly monograph titled <cite class="title italic">Judging a
                        Book by Its Cover</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#matthews2007">Matthews &amp; Moody 2007</a>] discussing book covers’ important roles. At
                    Goodreads.com, which is a general forum of readers, more than 400 lists related
                    to book covers have been generated by its users, which indicates readers’
                    long-standing interests in the topic. In fact, the importance of cover images
                    was clearly identified from the late 19th century, although 1930’s Penguin
                    Books’ paper revolution is generally considered as the beginning of the interest
                    in book covers [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#mccleery2007">McCleery 2007</a>]. Since the 19th century, book
                    bindings were commonly decorated on their covers or dust jackets to reflect the
                    content of the book, which is a modern development [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#pearson2013">Pearson 2013</a>]
                    and around the same time, the growing interests in children’s book publishing
                    started to emphasize the importance of book covers to attract the readers’ eye
                    and to promote the books for sales [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#immel2013">Immel 2013</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="jeong-media.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Despite active research activities on book covers, however, most studies are
                    based on individual book cover images, often with different cover images of a
                    single title over time and in different countries. A new method called media
                    visualization can help to overcome this limitation, allowing researchers to
                    explore various properties of images in a collection or to compare among
                    multiple image collections. </div>

                        (2007) created a prototype that visualizes the network of images by
                        graph-based representations and found that the nearest neighbor network can
                        have a positive effect on the interaction effort [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#worring2007">Worring et al. 2007</a>]. Yang et al. (2006) proposed a scalable semantic image browser which

                        with diverse semantics (4000 image topics) have obtained very positive
                        results. Camargo, Caicedo and Gonzalez (2013) proposed a framework for the

                        media, while media visualization shows the actual data [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#manovich2014">Manovich 2014</a>]. If standard information visualization
                        translates data into pictures, media visualization translate pictures into
                        pictures. Media visualization offers one solution to a fundamental question
                        of digital humanities — how to bring together macro and micro, distant
                        reading and close reading — “reading” the actual
                        artifacts and “reading” larger patterns abstracted - from
                        very large sets of these artifacts? [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#manovich2014">Manovich 2014</a>]. </div>

                        lab developed a visualization tool called ImagePlot by creating many custom

                        by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Manovich succinctly summarizes
                        the value of media visualization in the following: <blockquote><p>
                            Step away, and you can see larger patterns across a
                                whole data collection. Step closer, and you can study the details of

                        automatically obtained. Brightness Median is the median of grey scale values

                        which means purity of color, for each pixel in an image, and Hue Median is

                        (ImagePlot Documentation). For brightness measurements, color images are
                        internally converted to greyscale using this formula:
                        gray=(red+green+blue)/3. If an image is pure black, Brightness_Median will
                        be 0; if an image is pure white, it will be 255. Low Saturation_Median value
                        indicates that image colors are mostly desaturated; a high value indicates
                        that most colors are close to being pure (very saturated). The 0-255 scale
                        may lead to some confusion particularly for hue values since hue values are
                        normally represented as degree of a circle, 0 to 360, from yellow to red,
                        with green, blue and purple in the middle. Therefore, when the hue values

                            the books from the United Kingdom use much higher value of hue than
                            those from China. However, since hue is based on 360-degree circular
                            measurements for RGB (red, green and blue) values, the mean value may
                            not have intuitive indicators. Rather, the standard deviation values may

                            non-polar. Since ImagePlot converted all the values into 0-255 scale
                            regardless of their natural scale (for example, 0-360 for hue), each
                            option has its advantages and disadvantages. The polar option seems
                            fancier than the non-polar one, but the difficulty of interpretation
                            depends on which variables are used. For example, in Figure 7, it is
                            more intuitive to use the polar display because hue (red, green and blue
                            colors) is easily identified in counterclockwise direction from the
                            right side while the center represents darker and the periphery
                            represents brighter colors. However, in Figure 8, since neither
                            saturation nor brightness involves a circular data point, a polar
                            display option has little value. Rather, a simple x-y coordinate can
                            deliver easier interpretation, in this case, X-axis for brightness and
                            Y-axis for saturation. In general, a non-polar display is easier to
                            understand, while a polar display may have an advantage if hue is
                            involved.</div>

                        the media visualizations by ImagePlot showed that there are clear
                        differences among the cover images of bestselling books in different
                        countries, in terms of their brightness, hue and saturation values. The
                        differences are clear enough to allow us to draw a cautious but reasonable
                        generalization regarding cultural difference in book cover images. For
                        example, between East Asian culture and Anglo-American culture, there are
                        distinctive differences in brightness, hue and saturation. East Asian book
                        covers tend to have brighter colors, fewer red/purple colors, and fewer
                        saturated colors than Anglo-American books covers. These differences may
                        reflect different consumer preferences in book cover images, which gives a
                        good insight for global book translation business. In other words, when
                        publishers translate Anglo-American books into East Asian languages, they
                        may have to consider changing their book covers to have brighter and less
                        colorful images. The opposite suggestion should be made for the other
                        direction of translation, for example, translation of Chinese or Japanese
                        books into English. </div>

                        book selection process. For example, Thudt, Hinrichs and Carpendale (2012)
                        developed an interactive visualization system to allow serendipitous book
                        discoveries by providing cover images based on various metadata including
                        keywords, publication and content dates, length and author names [<a class="ref" href="jeong-media.html#thudt2012">Thudt et al. 2012</a>]. In their system, the cover color circle focuses
                        on this aesthetic quality of books by providing an overview of cover colors
                        as they occur in the book selection. With more refined and richer metadata
                        such as users’ preference and their searching or reading history, this kind
                        of approach can generate more sophisticated interactive book selection or
                        book recommendation systems. </div>

                        Including more countries would be better as well, particularly if cultural
                        differences are pursued. Even if changing cover images when translated into
