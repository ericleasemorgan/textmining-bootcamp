T he timely and important focus of this issue is open sciencein the humanities. Our coverage draws from the third
annual Virtual Symposium on Information & Technology in

the Arts & Humanities, presented on April 18 and 19, 2017, by

the ASIS&T Special Interest Groups/Arts and Humanities

(SIG/AH) and Visualization, Images and Sound (SIG/VIS).

Special section editor Jeremy McLaughlin provides an

extensive Introduction, including a synopsis of all the talks. 

In addition, papers based on four of the presentations are

included in the section. Together, they touch on many of the

recurring issues in adapting aspects of open science to the

humanities, including open access publishing, collaboration,

introducing students to born-digital publishing and the role of

metrics in academic evaluation in the humanities. 

In Association news, as part of its tradition of striving to

increase diversity and enhance inclusion across boundaries,

including international and cultural differences, ASIS&T held a

Diversity and Inclusion Luncheon for the first time at the 2016

Annual Meeting The purpose was both to celebrate our successes

in this area and to generate ideas for improvement and

expansion going forward. Annual Meeting co-chairs, Diane

Sonnenwald and Lauren Harrison, designed and organized the

luncheon, while eight colleagues, Judit Bar-Ilan, Harry Bruce,

Toni Carbo, Lynn Silipigni Connaway, Ixchel Faniel, Sandra

Hirsch, Fidelia Ibekwe-SanJuan and Adam Worrall, led

discussions at the lunch tables. In “2016 ASIS&T Annual Meeting

Diversity and Inclusion Luncheon: Report and Recommendations,”

the organizers include details of the event as well many of the

thoughtful recommendations for both the Annual Meeting

and ASIS&T as a whole generated by the table discussions. 

On the “President’s Page” Lynn Silipigni Connaway

introduces new ASIS&T executive director Lydia Middleton,

who started work at the Association on May 8. She announces

the plenary speakers for the Annual Meeting, details plans for

our 80 Anniversary celebration there and reminds us of

deadlines associated with the meeting program. Other topics

include her two weeks as a visiting professor at the University

of Hong Kong promoting information science research and

ASIS&T and her attendance with past president Nadia Caidi at

the meeting of the Council for Scientific Society Presidents. �
