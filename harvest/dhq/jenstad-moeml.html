                <p>Since 2014, <cite class="title italic">The Map of Early Modern London</cite> (<cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>) has partnered with professors and students
                    around the world in a unique collaboration between a digital humanities (DH)
                    project and humanities classrooms. The model we have developed addresses a
                    sustainability challenge for DH projects, provides professors with a way of
                    meeting administrative demands for engaged learning, and gives students a
                    high-stakes research-based learning opportunity with the potential for an
                    open-access, peer–reviewed publication. The <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>
                    Pedagogical Partnership Project emerged from a confluence of problems and
                    opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH practitioners is project-based:
                    how do we sustain the projects already begun? Another problem emerges as DH
                    moves out of the “big tent” and sets up camp in humanities
                    classrooms at smaller, non-R1 institutions. Also, for scholars not trained in
                    the technologies that drive many DH projects, crossing the analog-digital divide
                    might be daunting and discourage them from contributing to DH projects. To
                    address these challenges, the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> Pedagogical
                    Partnership takes Research-Based Learning (RBL) models and turns them into
                    high-profile publication opportunities, mobilizing ubiquitous social networking
                    and communication technologies to connect the project with the new demographic
                    of student contributors. This essay will highlight how digital projects and
                    digi-curious professors can collaborate to develop innovative pedagogical
                    practices that provide projects with content, enliven professors’ pedagogy, and
                    invite students to acquire scholarly research skills, gain digital literacy, and
                    engage in an interdisciplinary and international collaboration. We argue that DH
                    projects can be used innovatively and effectively in the classroom to promote
                    RBL. At the same time, DH projects–open-access ones in particular–can provide a
                    home both for humanities research and for the fruits of digital pedagogy across
                    a wide range of institutional settings.</p>

                    The <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> Pedagogical Partnership Project emerged
                    from a confluence of problems and opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH
                    practitioners is project-based: how do we sustain the projects already begun?
                    Another problem emerges as DH moves out of the “big tent” and
                    sets up camp in humanities classrooms.<a class="noteRef" href="jenstad-moeml.html#d10984e246">[1]</a> A complaint about DH is
                    that it requires infrastructure and support and is therefore inaccessible to the “‘have-nots’ of the mainstream humanities”
                         [<a class="ref" href="jenstad-moeml.html#grusin2014">Grusin 2014</a>]. Even if newcomers do have the resources to build something new (thereby
                    adding to the number of projects requiring curation and care), must they do so
                    in order to be doing DH? Another problem faces potential contributors to DH
                    projects: crossing the analog-digital divide can be daunting for scholars not
                    trained in the technologies that drive many DH projects. Projects and
                    contributors share the need to disseminate and mobilize scholarship. Academic
                    faculty are increasingly enjoined to publish in open-access fora, which
                    increases the need for reputable digital venues. We also need to capture the
                    original work of students, for whom the processes of scholarly publishing
                    (regardless of medium) can be alienating.</div>

                        as an intranet pedagogical tool, the project has developed multiple
                        resources that are far from completion: the first is a descriptive Gazetteer
                        of over one-thousand streets, sites, administrative units, and other
                        features; the second is a Library of texts that are crucial to our
                        understanding of early modern literary London but are rarely anthologized or
                        have never been edited at all. As the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>
                        team turned its attention to building the best possible platform–adding a
                        digital edition of the Agas map with built-in drawing tools, enabling GIS
                        capabilities, linking to Google Maps, working with other projects to
                        geolocate their data, and compiling finding aids and bibliographies–the core
                        resources of the site remained unfinished. This problem is not unique to

                        with online, open-access publications, but simply putting research on the
                        web is not enough. Furthermore, professors of all stripes are increasingly
                        being asked to mobilize knowledge, make it public, and quantify its impact
                        while also engaging students in meaningful research. In the twenty years
                        since the Boyer Commission’s report was published, we have seen calls for
                        research-intensive courses, capstone courses, and undergraduate research
                        scholarships across the disciplines and in institutions of all sizes. It has
                        been imposed by well-meaning administrators on faculty members without (in
                        some cases) much guidance about how to invite students into the research
                        process or how to mobilize research for the public good. We are not
                        accustomed to expecting original research from undergraduate students, even
                        though we can offer them access to primary texts, archival materials, and
                        tools that were unimaginable even ten years ago. Even with these new
                        resources, some of us find it hard to imagine innovative ways to get our
                        undergraduates involved in an historic research model that has generally
                        been conducted by lone scholars working in an archive and then writing up
                        their findings.<a class="noteRef" href="jenstad-moeml.html#d10984e321">[3]</a> An
                        obvious solution to this challenge is to get more scholars involved in RBL
                        and DH work. How can we reach across to our fellow teachers, especially
                        those lacking technological skillsets, and invite them to contribute their
                        expertise to a digital project?</div>

                    2002. Certain material conditions had to pertain before she could develop the
                    Pedagogical Partnership she envisioned: grant funding, a team of research
                    assistants, and a collaborator (McLean-Fiander). But the key impetus to launch
                    the Partnership came from faculty members outside DH who had been charged with
                    doing undergraduate research in the classroom and mobilizing student
                    scholarship. A 2013 exchange on Facebook and email between Peter Herman at San
                    Diego State University (SDSU) and Jenstad at the University of Victoria (UVic)
                    catalyzed the transformation of the 2002 Windsor students’ idea into the reality
                    of <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s current Pedagogical Partnership. Herman
                    wrote that he was teaching a very small seminar the following semester that was
                    supposed to focus on undergraduate research. He wanted to go beyond <cite class="title italic">Early English Books Online</cite> (<cite class="title italic">EEBO</cite>), which he had been using successfully in the undergraduate
                    classroom [<a class="ref" href="jenstad-moeml.html#herman2015">Herman 2015</a>], and asked Jenstad if she had any
                    innovative ideas about using <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> in some way. The
                    timing was ideal. With McLean-Fiander having recently joined the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> team, we had conceived the idea of “starting a pilot project whereby we team up with professors in
                        other locations, supply teaching materials, and have the students contribute
                        to <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> under the close supervision of their
                        professor on site.” Jenstad wrote to Herman that <blockquote><p>

                            proposition. <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> needs contributors and

                        necessarily involve teaching DH directly, but it can provide DH skills and
                        model DH values outside a formal DH curriculum. It allows partners to teach
                        robust research skills while using digital resources and/or writing for the
                        digital environment. The <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> module teaches
                        student participants to write for a different medium (the web). Because we
                        cite preferentially from open-access resources, students at large
                        institutions learn to look beyond subscription resources while students from
                        smaller institutions (without journal and database subscriptions) find that
                        they are not disadvantaged in the research process. Thus, the partnership
                        promotes the new models of dissemination pioneered by DH practitioners
                        (open-access, Creative Commons licensing, new models of peer review) and
                        brings attention to projects that may not be indexed in library catalogues.
                        The high visibility of the module invites students to do their best work.
                        The complexity of the projects demands collaboration, a hallmark of DH.
                        Different people bring different skills to the table. Some students will be
                        wizards with certain aspects of technology that may well be daunting for
                        their professors. Thus, the module compresses and occasionally inverts

                        answer legitimate questions, cultivates a spirit of collaboration, and

                        digital revolution upon humanities research questions. The pedagogical

                        project-based model of DH. For good reason, RBL tends to happen at R1
                        institutions and DH tends to happen at places with centres: both are
                        research and resource intensive. A typical objection to RBL is that it is
                        difficult to practice in small institutions that do not have extensive
                        library, technical, or infrastructural resources. Critics have said the same
                        of DH [<a class="ref" href="jenstad-moeml.html#pannapacker2013">Pannapacker 2013</a>]. The two objections to RBL and DH
                        have tended to be mutually reinforcing. In UVic’s Maker Lab in the

                        students undertaking Directed Readings (for course credit) or Jamie Cassels
                        Undergraduate Research Awards (scholarships to conduct original research
                        with a faculty member). Again, however, these are elite opportunities

                        term at our partner institutions. As noted by the “Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights,” a professor who assigns
                        a <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> module “must primarily consider the student’s own
                                intellectual growth”

                        the partner institution’s assessment standards. Once the Partnership is

                        discuss the nature of the contribution. The contribution needs to help
                        students achieve the learning outcomes for the course. In keeping with RBL
                        practices, the contribution must be relevant to the professor’s own research
                        questions and expertise. It must also fit the project’s needs; for <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>, the pressing needs are encyclopedia

                            learning opportunity. UVU is a large (30K student), open-enrollment
                            university that doubles as a community college. Its focus on
                                “Engaged Learning” was recognized in 2008 with
                            the official Carnegie designation of “Elective Community

                            according to original performance practices or under original

                            former students. The troupe visited McPherson’s class and performed
                            scenes from <cite class="title italic">The Taming of the Shrew</cite> near
                            the end of the term. McPherson had students undertake in-class

                            American Shakespeare Center, and made frequent use of comparison clips
                            of modern films and Shakespeare’s Globe performances. For the Engaged
                            Learning component of the course, McPherson had her students research
                            and write an article about the Curtain Theatre for <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>. She considered this exercise her first DH project.
                            The module allowed the students to mobilize new findings from the

                            metacognitive effects of the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> module.
                            They detailed “how metaliteracy was intrinsic to the
                                    experience of undergraduate Renaissance Drama students embarking

                        the team could process quickly. At the time of writing (January 2016),
                            <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> has had sixteen Pedagogical Partners
                        from four countries and a variety of institutions.<a class="noteRef" href="jenstad-moeml.html#d10984e1056">[17]</a> The project has published thirteen articles, with
                        five more in draft at the encoding stage, and a further 28 assigned or in
                        revisions. Research assistants in Victoria invested time checking facts,
                        tagging people, places, dates, and sources, finding images, and sometimes
                        performing further research. As <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> moves
                        forward with future Partnerships, the project team must use its limited
                        resources wisely. To this end, <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> has
                        already implemented and continues to work on a series of “fixes.” The new
                        Teaching splash page<a class="noteRef" href="jenstad-moeml.html#d10984e1069">[18]</a> on the site
                        provides partners with a clear overview of their role, the module, <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s submission criteria, and the resources
                        available to Guest Editors and students on and off site. <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> now insists that contributions from
                        Partnerships include project-specific identifiers for people, places, and dates.<a class="noteRef" href="jenstad-moeml.html#d10984e1081">[19]</a>
                        Making such identifications are part of the critical work to be done by the
                        researcher; in many cases, <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> RAs would have
                        to replicate the research to make the identification. Pedagogical
                        Partnerships have helpfully shown where our contributor guidelines needed
                        expansion and clearer organization; it remains to be seen if students would
                        benefit from customized guidelines pitched at their level. <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> needs to fine-tune the peer-review process
                        so that the work is spread out across a wider range of reviewers. When its
                        current grant funding comes to an end in April 2016, <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> will need to assess the viability of the Partnerships.
                        Without funding, the project can still support a few experienced partners.
                        Even with renewed grant funding, <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> will
                        move to a competitive application model. Word-of-mouth alone has brought

                        although advertising via a CFP site and various discipline-specific
                        listservs and websites would be an obvious course of action when the process

                        Some submissions did not meet the standard for publication, a decision
                        usually taken by the Guest Editor but sometimes deferred to the project
                        team. Not all students <em class="emph">want</em> to contribute. Janni Aragon,
                        Director of Technology Integrated Learning at UVic, attended one of <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s workshops and pointed out that students
                        need an “out.” As teachers, we cannot require students to
                        share their work in public fora. They may have personal or professional
                        reasons for wanting their work in the course to be a terminal exercise seen
                        only by the professor. Partners need be aware of ethical implications and
                        legal regulations at their home institutions. They may need to have students
                        sign waivers. They may need to have alternative assignments ready for
                        students who do not wish to participate. Whether or not the work results in

                        after the end of the course; students were understandably impatient with the
                        process or simply not available to participate in post-course revisions.

                        Marylhurst University worked a module on London Wall into a Study Abroad
                        course, where her students traced the route of the Roman-era wall during

                        Encyclopedia articles are not the only types of assignments <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> can accommodate. One of Tracey Hill’s
                        students at Bath Spa University transcribed a pageant book for the anthology
                        of mayoral shows. For Jennifer Drouin’s graduate-level Digital Humanities

                        designed an Encoding Partnership whereby students encoded proclamations for
                        the Library as part of their introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative
                        (TEI). Jenstad is currently experimenting with partnering up two classes in
                        different locations to try double-keying diplomatic transcriptions, in an
                        effort to teach descriptive bibliography, transcription, and encoding via an

                        such a module in a course, or seek out other projects with whom to partner.
                        We would like to see further expansion of this model not necessarily by
                        growth at <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> but via uptake by other
                        projects. A key limitation on <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s expansion
                        of the Pedagogical Partnership is the availability of grant-funding, since
                        project team members check, encode, and upload content in-house, essentially
                        functioning as a publisher without the infrastructure of a university press.
                        Other digital projects with different types of content, different content
                        management models, and registration tools (e.g., the capacity to capture
                        data via web interfaces, or to register contributors as Wiki users) may be
                        able to accommodate more contributors. Jenstad tested the extensibility of
                        the Encoding Partnership by having her graduate course on “Textual Studies
                        and Methods of Research” partner with the <cite class="title italic">Database of

                        Students transcribed poems from digital surrogates, followed the project’s
                        guidelines, and downloaded an encoding package prepared by the project’s
                        programmer. Many projects need help with transcriptions, markup, updating
                        bibliographies, reviewing, collecting and entering data, writing
                        encyclopedia entries, surfacing and describing materials, and creating
                        finding aids. Data created by one project might be available for
                        visualization or analysis by another project or using another tool, with the
                        results potentially augmenting what is already available on the project’s
                        site. Projects in need of such help might consider pedagogical partnerships

                        and/or Contributor Guidelines, an irregular publication cycle (i.e., one not
                        locked into “Issues” or “Releases”), a
                        variety of roles that students can perform, evidence of past student
                        contributions (although this evidence is not essential, since a project may
                        never have thought of mobilizing student scholarship), and, of course, a
                        digital presence. It helps to know a colleague on the project (as Herman
                        knew Jenstad). One possible pitch is to say “Would you be willing to
                            consider contributions from students if I were to vet them first?”
                        Above all, it is important that the project provide an opportunity for
                        students to exercise skills that they would need to learn in the course
                        anyway. If students need to learn palaeography, then a manuscript

                                modes of online engagement have been described as Resident in that
                                they involve the individual being present, or residing, to a certain

                                sacrifice as much personal agency to the institution to gain

                    the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> Pedagogical Partnership in their call for
                    papers. Having been held up as a model of critical skills development, we would
                    like to conclude by reflecting on the extent to which our Partnerships engage in
                    what <cite class="title italic">DHQ </cite>issue editors Murphy and Smith
                    characterized as “a multidimensional reimagining of where undergrads sit in
                        the field” and how we “conceive of their [students’] role in the
                        shifting knowledge economies produced by digital scholarship.” In
                    producing digital content, our partnering students develop the usual critical
                    skills of English majors but also begin thinking about other things, such as
                    platforms, infrastructures, and how knowledge is made. The Partnership teaches
                    students to be highly aware users of (i.e., Visitors to) digital resources (both
                    subscription and open-access). At the same time, it lowers the technological
                    barriers that often stand between humanities scholars in general (students and
                    faculty alike) and the digital projects created largely by so-called digital
                    humanists. The Partnership enables students to see themselves as producers of
                    digital resources and to become Residents of the digital terrain.  We
                    democratize DH when we open up this subject position to students. The digital
                    space can welcome student contributors simply because it casts a bigger net
                    around original research; opening up <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> pages to
                    students does not mean taking away publishing opportunities from others. The
                    biggest impediment to publishing student work is time–time spent on peer review,
                    copyediting, and the additional demands of encoding. The <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite> team and the Guest Editors can invest this time in student
                    learning because the benefits are mutual.</div>

                    the larger web of knowledge (by citation and/or links). Putting XML:ids into
                    submissions demands that students think about concepts that have been driven by
                    and are required by new forms of digital scholarship. Quoting a toponym from a
                    source is not enough; students have to think about what that toponym represents
                    and point to a stable, shared reference point. They become implicitly aware of
                    the need for authority names, linked open data, and identifiers (DOIs, XML:ids,
                    and URIs). They start to think about humanities research findings as data and
                    information as a network.  At the same time, the Partnership does not preclude
                    opportunities to acquire skills in digital mapping and text encoding if students
                    wish. Professors and students who are technologically savvy or willing to learn
                    can adjust the module to teach various combinations of DH skills and research
                    skills.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="jenstad-moeml.html#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">A lot of what we do in the academy is scaffolded learning that builds towards the
                    masterpiece–the complete work that demands mastery of all the skills required of
                    a particular scholarly output. The capstone project, the MA thesis, and the PhD
                    dissertation are the traditional forms of the masterpiece. Like RBL, <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>’s Partnership asks the undergraduate to produce
                    a masterpiece earlier in the game. The student works with others to take a
                    research problem to its logical conclusion, which is published in an environment
                    where the answer reaches a readership beyond the instructor in the course. The
                    sheer scope of the user-base of an open-access digital project is highly
                    motivating to the student. The scholarly injunctions become immediate and
                    pressing: to be exhaustive, to acknowledge prior and current voices in the
                    scholarly conversation, to consult all available sources of information, to use
                    many types of sources outside their home libraries and home disciplines, and to
                    master the form and richness required for the venue.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="jenstad-moeml.html#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">We began this paper talking about how the <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>
                    Partnership emerged from “a confluence of problems and opportunities.”
                    While Pedagogical Partnerships are not, in the long run, an efficient way of
                    generating content for <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>, the project has
                    benefitted tremendously from the influx of fresh voices, the growing community
                    of students and professors who have a digital “Residence” in
                        <cite class="title italic">MoEML</cite>, the corrections they have made to
                    neighbouring pages, their suggestions for new places, and their feedback on the
                    Contributor Guidelines. The Guest Editors have welcomed the opportunity to
                    embrace a new pedagogy that meets new institutional demands, brings high-profile
                    attention to their institutions, and engages students in scholarly publication.
                    Many of the Partners have been featured in their campus magazines and local
                    media, which has, in turn, been good for the project. The full benefit to the
                    students remains to be seen. It is certain that some of them found the prospect
                    of producing publishable work daunting at the outset, and ultimately not all the
                    articles were publishable (which is a reality of academic life). The model will
                    be truly successful if it becomes a habitual way that students interact with and
                    improve the digital resources we all use in our scholarly lives. We fully expect
                    to see many of them stake a greater claim in the digital sphere in the years
                    ahead.</div>
