Observing changes in some state or behaviour of a large population is a task tackled by different research communities using various disparate means the start of an epidemic may be detected by analysing data from hospital admissions 1 a shift in public opinion may be discovered by telephone polls and surveys 2 4 and an increase in criminal behaviour can be detected by analysing police records Sometimes even indirect information can be useful to this effect changes in society can be detected by observing sales of a given product over time 5 by comparing electoral results 6 and stock markets 7 or by analysing web searches 8 9 and social media content 10 13 For a few quantities such as for example the price of wheat or daily temperatures high quality records have been kept for a long time and have proven valuable for historians and social scientists Changes continuities and fluctuations in those quantities can be highly meaningful if interpreted in the correct context However for most aspects of social behaviour we do not have a direct way of recording them as they happen why would anyone directly measure how much time people spent in church or at a pub over many decades Over very short time periods this has been attempted by the Mass Observation project 14 but this approach cannot be applied over the long periods that are typical of major social changes bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p2 This is where a new source of data can be invaluable the contents of regional daily newspapers provide an indirect but nevertheless informative record of everyday life for long periods of time bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p3 With the automatic digitisation of large quantities of historical newspapers and books it has recently become possible to analyse historical data which indirectly reflect the conditions of a population at a given time and place bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p4 Previous studies conducted on the contents of historical books 15 and newspapers 16 have already revealed continuities changes and events including linguistic evolution and cultural shifts through the impact they left in the text bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p5 An important class of behaviours and phenomena are those that occur periodically for studies about climate and economy these may include seasonal cycles and their accurate observation can help to understand the mechanisms behind them In the case of collective behaviour within a society these may include all sorts of activities that are repeated at regular intervals and could lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that may cause large amounts of people to engage in the same activities at the same time and at regular intervals For example recent studies on the content of online activities have revealed clear cycles in certain behaviours such as smoking cessation and mental health information seeking 17 18 and have used those observations to propose possible mechanisms behind them A further study 19 analysed four daily time series of sentiment extracted from Twitter in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> representing the amount of negative affect anxiety anger and sadness expressed in the collective discourse This revealed a strong seasonal structure to mood particularly showing winter peaks for these negative emotions It also reported a similar seasonality in <ORGANIZATION>Wikipedia</ORGANIZATION> searches that are related to mental health bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p6 In this study we address the problem of detecting periodic activities at a whole population level by analysing time series of words frequencies extracted from historical newspapers spanning a long period of time We are interested in following the relative frequency of each word on each day over a period of many decades to detect those words that show a significant periodic pattern The final goal is not just to detect those periodic words but to understand the social reality behind them and to shed light on the underlying social synchronisation mechanism responsible for their periodic expression bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p7 The technical challenge is both of a statistical and computational nature and it is so general that its solution can be directly applied to many other cases where massively multivariate time series are analysed This is the case for example in the analysis of stock market data sensor networks data and financial transactions bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p8 We propose a general method to discover statistically significant periodic patterns in these massively multivariate time series and we use it to demonstrate how historical newspapers can be used to understand cycles in collective behaviour In particular we discovered that a large number of activities were taking place in a seasonal fashion during the 87 years under investigation and were mostly synchronised with the environment These included leisure or agriculture or cultural activities We further demonstrated how these cyclic behaviours have now changed with activities being more synchronised by cultural phenomena like the football season bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p9 In order to detect periodicity in the textual time series we make use of the theory of <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> transforms 20 Any time series can be decomposed into a linear combination of simpler sine and cosine components that oscillate at each harmonic frequency The Fourier coefficients associated with each frequency component form the Fourier Spectrum of the time series sometimes known as its frequency domain representation and provide information about the proportion of variance explained by a sinusoidal waveform along with the peak time in the period of oscillation bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p10 Taking this approach we automatically discover periodic patterns in time series of daily word frequencies extracted from millions of pages of digitised historical newspapers in two distinct corpora one originating from the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and the other from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> both covering the same period in history Specifically the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> corpus consists of 28 5 billion words from 121 different news outlets while the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> corpus contains 45 6 billion words from 1 635 news outlets For each of the corpora we analyse the daily time series of news content in the 87 year interval between 1836 and 1922 We focus on the 25 000 most common words resulting in the analysis of 50 000 time series each consisting of 31 755 daily readings and we concentrate on cycles between 30 days and 5 years in order to compare findings across countries and time An example showing two of these time series is shown in Fig 1 bookmark pone 0165736 g001 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 1 An example of two different word time series as

article1 body1 sec2 sec1 p4 For the modern day <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> time series we processed 2 7 million English language news articles from 1 231 news outlets that have a web presence and are published in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> covering the six year period between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2015 News articles were gathered from the Really Simple Syndication RSS feed for the front page of the news outlets representing the top stories on their website an analogous concept to the front page of a newspaper Collection of the articles was performed by our modular system for news media analysis 22 This process involved selecting feeds for news media outlets by crawling a number of seed webpages such as lists of newspapers on <ORGANIZATION>Wikipedia</ORGANIZATION> 23 and manually adding them to the system Following this each news article which appeared in any of the news feeds during the period was retrieved extracting the main text of the news article by separating it from non content textual information such as comments or navigation using an adaptation of the text to tag ratio 24 which extracts the largest set of

article1 body1 sec2 sec2 p3 Photoperiod day length was computed 28 using the same time interval used for weather observations in two representative locations <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> bookmark sec005 Methodology bookmark sec006 Overview bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec1 p1 We analysed time series extracted from two large scale historical corpora consisting respectively of 28 5 and 45 6 billion words covering the years from 1836 to 1922 31 755 days collected from 121 <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and 1 635 <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> newspapers Our analysis can be broken down into two key steps one aimed at the estimation of the daily relative frequency of each word which is detailed in the word time series generation section the other aimed at the detection of significant periodicities in the resulting time series described in the Fourier analysis and significance testing sections The first step starts with the raw counts of a word in a day and involves normalisation smoothing de trending and standardisation of the time series The second one applies the fast Fourier Transform to each time series and then performs statistical hypothesis testing The key challenge here is to account for the massively multiple statistical testing bookmark sec007 Word time series generation bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec2 p1 Time series for each word were generated for each corpus independently in the following way Text from each corpus was first tokenized using the Word Break rules from the Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm following the specification in the <ORGANIZATION>Unicode Standard Annex</ORGANIZATION> 29 http unicode org reports tr29 Each token was further processed to remove possessives trailing s at the end of words lowercased and stemmed using the <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> stemmer algorithm 29 as is standard in text mining applications The number of times a word occurred on a given date was computed across all articles or pages using the date assigned to the article or page resulting in a raw count for the number of times a word was mentioned per day as well as the total count for the entire corpus The 29th February was removed from each leap year to keep the time series aligned The sum for the total number of words used per day was also computed and we refer to this as the daily volume Days which contained no data due to the corpus containing no data for that specific date had the raw count and daily volume interpolated using linear interpolation to fill in the gaps We focused on the 25 000 most commonly occurring words in each corpus before removing the 260 words from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus and 567 words from the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus with a gap of longer than nine years A 15 day centred moving average was applied to both the raw counts and the daily volume in order to improve the estimation of a word s frequency The raw counts for each word were then divided by the daily volume on each corresponding date to give the relative frequency times series of each word The main concern in this step was to ensure that we have enough statistics to estimate the relative frequency of a word where many of the words will be rather rare due to <PERSON>Zipf</PERSON> s law This was one of the key reasons why we limited our analysis to the most commonly occurring words and introduce the 15 day moving average bookmark sec008 Pre processing of the time series bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec3 p1 As is standard in spectral analysis 30 we further de trended the relative frequency series performed by applying a 10 year centred moving average to the relative frequency series to obtain a trend time series The original relative frequency series was de trended by subtracting the corresponding trend time series for the word The de trended time series of each word was standardized before clipping values lying outside three standard deviations to reduce the effect of rare extreme events on the result A final standardisation step is performed for convenience bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec3 p2 The 15 day centred moving average that is applied defines the smallest resolution that we can discover for the period of a word while the 10 year de trending step defines the largest resolution for discovered periodicities Therefore with these parameters we certainly have removed any periodic signal lower than 15 days and higher than 10 years To stay in a safe interval of frequencies and avoid boundary effects we double the lower threshold and half the higher one only considering cycles over 30 days or below 5 years bookmark sec009 Fourier analysis bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec4 p1 We performed a standard fast <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> transformation 20 on the time series of each word 21 24 433 words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus 24 740 in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus obtaining for each word the spectrum of the Fourier frequencies deemed resolvable by the <PERSON>Nyquist</PERSON> sampling Theorem 31 We focused on periods between 30 days and 5 years double the size of the smoothing window of 15 days and half the size of the de trending applied as explained above The spectrum was normalised so that each component could be interpreted as the proportion of variance explained in a time series by the corresponding frequency At this point we have a Fourier spectrum for each of the words in the two corpora and the next stage is to perform a multiple statistical test as described below We should note that periodicity of a time series is a matter of degree while we test all the words our analysis then focuses only on those words that have a sufficiently large component in the spectrum so that a large part of their variance can be explained by a single component bookmark sec010 Statistical significance testing bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec5 p1 We divide the statistical testing procedure into two steps computing p values for a single word and accounting for multiple testing For the first step we use the magnitude of the largest component in the Fourier spectrum as the test statistic and a null hypothesis that the data was sampled i i d from a distribution with the same properties as the given data white noise The p value is the probability that the spectrum of a time series generated by the null hypothesis has a peak equal or larger than the one observed bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec5 p2 One way to generate a time series according to the null hypothesis is to randomly permute it generating a white noise time series whose spectrum is known to be uniform We also assume that the magnitude of the largest peak over many random permutations will follow an Extreme Value Distribution EVD an assumption that we verified numerically by chi squared test In order to fit an EVD to the given data we performed 1 000 random permutations for each time series computing the test statistic each time and then fitting the EVD by maximum likelihood This was then used to calculate the probability of the observed value of test statistic under the null model For each word we find a p value that is less than 4 65e 10 bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec5 p3 For the second step we note that this procedure has been repeated for each of the 25 000 words in each corpus therefore leading to a massive number of multiple tests We use the Bonferroni correction to account for this and find that the probability of a non periodic word being added to our list of periodic words is less than 1 bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec5 p4 In order to double check the above results a smaller set of words was tested even further using a different null hypothesis and a brute force calculation of the p value This was done by permuting the raw word count time series before following the same processing steps as in the original study instead of permuting the relative frequency time series This gives rise to a null hypothesis closer to the concept of background noise rather than white noise The brute force approach consisted in sampling 2 5 million random permutations and assessing whether the test statistic the largest component in any of our random Fourier spectrums is equally as large or larger than for the original time series Again this p value is then corrected using the Bonferroni correction to account for the massive number of multiple tests we are performing We obtained identical results once more showing that we could not explain any of our findings with the alternative null hypothesis Hence using both approaches we found that all words that we identified as periodic are significant when maintaining the probability of at least one false rejection at the significance level of 1 after the number of multiple tests performed bookmark sec011 Boundary effects in the frequency domain bookmark article1 body1 sec3 sec6 p1 While the above procedure was designed just to identify the strongest components of each word provided they are in the interval between 30 days and 5 years we should note for the sake of being exhaustive that if we expanded the analysis to consider any frequency we would see that a number of unrelated words display a very weak peak at 3175 5 days which is exactly 1 10th of the full time series and which seems to be due to an artefact This is probably a systematic effect of our pre processing steps and finite sample sizes We inspected those time series and found no periodic pattern in the time domain This period is outside the interval of frequencies under investigation and was not included in any successive analysis bookmark sec012 Results and Discussion bookmark article1 body1 sec4 p1 <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> analysis of the 50 000 time series extracted from our two corpora reveals some striking properties First of all while a large proportion of words exhibit a weak periodicity we discover that there is a subset of about 2 of the words which are strongly periodic which we define as having more than 20 of their variation explained in terms of one single component In an even smaller set of words over 90 of the variation can be explained by using the 5 largest components bookmark article1 body1 sec4 p2 More specifically at least 5 of the variance can be explained by a single component for 21 of the words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and 42 in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> a single component explains at least 10 of the variance for 5 of the words in <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and 10 in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> while 20 of the variance can be explained by a single component for 1 6 of words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and 2 1 in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> Remarkably 16 words in the <LOCATION>UK 27</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> can account for more than 50 of their variation using only a single component As a reference the time series of daily temperature for the same historical period in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> can explain 84 of its variance with a single component corresponding to a yearly period while the variation in the daily precipitation level is only explained 1 In other words certain words and by inference certain human activities are at least as periodic as the weather bookmark article1 body1 sec4 p3 Of those periodic words an important finding is that 15 in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and 20 in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> are best explained by a 365 day period although other secondary periods can be detected in those words while a small number are best explained by a 30 day six month two year and even four year period Fig 2 This indicates that there is a small set of cycles behind many human activities Furthermore the phase time of peaking of these periodic components is not distributed uniformly across the year Most yearly words tend to peak either in the summer or in the winter While certain phenomena and activities clearly peak in the spring and autumn the majority of words tend to peak in July or December Further analysis of the peaking time of words is detailed in the section on comparisons with temperature photoperiod and precipitation bookmark pone 0165736 g002 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide

corresponding to the expected time of year in a 365 day period Besides these obvious words which provide a useful sanity check we detect a strong yearly periodic component in words related to leisure activities agriculture hunting food and weather as well as the periodic seasonal return of certain infectious diseases Figs 3 and 4 show the words from each corpus that are strongly periodic with a

<LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> display strongly periodic behaviour with words relating to outdoor leisure activities such as fete picnic excursion and trip appearing most frequently in the summer while during the winter indoor activities become commonplace including opera pantomime theatre and soiree This contrasts with outdoor work activities which take place as required and are mostly associated with agriculture such as harvest and the other related words of crop reaper and thresh mostly occurring every year around July and August or animal care such as shear and shearling also peaking every July and August bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec1 p3 The activity of hunting game and other animals is also strongly periodic within the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus indicating its importance as an outdoor winter activity with words relating to quarry generally appearing towards the middle of their open season 32 with pheasant and geese peaking in December grouse in September and partridge in November while references to dogs typically used for hunting such as foxhounds and harriers appear in January In the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> there are fewer strongly periodic words relating to hunting and quarry although those that do appear such as rabbit geese quail and beaver peak during the winter months bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec1 p4 Food related words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> exhibit a strong connection to the availability of different fruits and vegetables during the seasons with the majority of these words concentrating their phase between July and September when the fruit and vegetables would typically be harvested 33 including cucumber tomato onion strawberry plum and cherry A similar pattern can be seen in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus although some of the food related words can be found peaking earlier in the year such as strawberry in May and asparagus radish and lettuce in April Other plants such as flowers also follow their corresponding seasonal patterns 34 in the corpora including geraniums and roses peaking in July carnations and marigolds in August and chrysanthemums appearing later in the autumn bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec1 p5 One remarkably periodic word that does not seem to be directly related to any religious or agricultural calendar is the word lecture which peaks in early January in both the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpora and where 55 of the variance can be explained by a single component in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and 31 in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> We have not found it to relate to any one specific event such as the Royal Institution s traditional Christmas lecture but rather to an increased number of lectures taking place all around the country through the period of the New Year Upon close reading these were found to be as diverse as lectures on tuberculosis radium and x rays or foreign travel delivered in Esperanto and fit with the general idea of a Victorian era romance with festive science 35 36 bookmark sec014 Testing disease words for seasonality bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p1 Some disease

<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> cough pneumonia croup and bronchial peak in January and early February colic diarrhoea and dysentery peak in August and typhoid peaks during October bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p2 We additionally tested the periodicity of other disease related words besides those strongly periodic words directly discovered by our method The words we tested were chosen because they refer to illnesses that are claimed to be seasonal in epidemiological papers 37 38 and we wished to ascertain if they do have a cyclic behaviour within our corpora even if only a small part of their variance can be explained by a single component and if their peak season reflects the general opinion of epidemiologists bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p3 Of the 10 diseases and symptoms which are believed to be seasonal in the articles we consulted 37 we discovered that seven of those were seasonal in at least one of the corpora one diphtheria was not and two rotavirus and gonorrhoea could not

found not to follow a seasonal pattern in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus while in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> 11 of its variance was explained by a seasonal pattern peaking in February bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p4 Additionally we wished to test the periodicity of the word death to see if this followed a seasonal pattern in our corpora as has been observed in various studies 39 41 that often indicate winter months as the peak time for death by disease and warmer months for violent death We found that death can explain 4 of its variance using a seasonal component in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> with a peak in January matching the phase reported in other literature 42 In the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> however death is best explained 3 by a six month component with peaks in early February and early August which appears to coincide with the phase of the respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases we found to be strongly periodic This is a weak signal however so further work needs to be done to separate the various causes of death bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p5 While a certain amount of variance in disease related words can be explained by a seasonal cycle this is not particularly strong suggesting that seasonality is only one of the factors influencing epidemics or other causes of death However the time of peaking we found is compatible with the time we would expect for measles chickenpox late winter and early spring and fever and influenza cold months bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p6 We also should note that there is a methodological difference when performing statistical testing for words which are discovered from the data to be strongly periodic and those which we shortlisted a priori as is the case for these disease related words This difference refers to the way we account for multiple testing since the p value is affected by the size of the list bookmark sec015 Comparisons across datasets bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 p1 Comparing the time series from the two historical corpora with each other we can find differences in the behaviours and activities performed in the past allowing us to compare across different geographical regions Additionally using a corpus of modern news gathered from the web we investigate words which continue to be periodic now and those which ceased to be periodic bookmark sec016 Comparing historical news between the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec1 p1 When comparing <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> historical news we can see important differences in the words which are strongly periodic Many of these differences can be accounted for by linguistics climate or customs For example the word seashore is strongly periodic 35 within the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> with a peak in mid July while this word is not present within the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> However we do find the word seaside is strongly periodic 34 for the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus with a peak in mid July within two days of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> peak for seashore bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec1 p2 Climate differences between the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are evidenced by the strongly periodic mention of particular fruits including watermelon and cantaloupe exclusively being periodic in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> or nectarines exclusively being periodic in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> Looking specifically at the words for the seasons we see that whilst summer peaks in both countries between 25th June <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and 28th June <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> the other seasons all peak one month earlier in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> suggesting that the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> summer from the peak of summer on 25th June to the peak of autumn on 10th September was considered a month shorter than in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> lasting from 28th June to the peak of autumn on 4th October bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec1 p3 Differences in customs between the two countries can be found in larger sets of related words topics which are strongly periodic and peak together around the same time of year but only exist in one of the countries One of the most obvious of these is the appearance of many baseball related words in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> umpire pitcher base etc peaking around July whereas the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> shows a peak of cricket related words at the same time wicket stump runout etc Other topics which appear more periodically every year in only one of the countries include gardening related words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> flower names horticulture etc and fashion related words in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> stylish tailor millinery etc A full list of periodic words which appear in only one of the corpora can be found in S1 and S2 Datasets bookmark sec017 Comparing past with present bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec2 p1 We also compared the historical <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news with modern day <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news gathered from 1 231 <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news outlets on the web covering a period of six years between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2015 to see if anything has changed in the periodic structure of news content which might signal a change in culture or behaviour over the past century For example we discovered that the word lecture mentioned earlier no longer appears as periodic in the modern news whilst it was found to be one of the most strongly periodic words in the past suggesting the cultural phenomenon of festive science is a lost tradition whereas pantomimes which were periodic in the past 20 remain periodic 23 in modern news Other lost traditions that emerge strongly from the dataset include gooseberries a traditional British summer fruit which was periodic before 46 but is no longer found in the modern corpus and whose disappearance from the shops has been lamented in the media 43 hunting activities and their associated quarry with many of the words related to hunting no longer being periodic including both the quarry pheasant partridge snipe etc and the dogs used for hunting such as foxhounds and harriers and the tradition of passing the time in the colder months with music concerts as evidenced by concert audience accompanist etc bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec2 p2 Other traditions and customs in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> appear to have persisted over the last century including the national pastimes of gardening as evidenced by many related words such as horticulture garden and greenhouse remaining strongly periodic in the modern news from the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and talking about the weather indicated by words such as sunshine snow and thunderstorm also remaining strongly periodic today bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec2 p3 We can also look at the opposite comparison investigating words that mark our seasons now but did not do so in the past These include skier and sled in the winter and barbecue and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in the summer Additionally we see a large number of words relating to imported traditions from other cultures in the modern news such as <LOCATION>Halloween Oktoberfest Ibiza</LOCATION> grotto <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> and reindeer Indeed we can see that whilst pumpkin was never periodic in the historical <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news it was found to be periodic in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> news with 32 of its variance explained by a seasonal component with a peak in November and has now been incorporated into <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> culture with 20 of its variance explained by a seasonal component and a peak in late October in the modern <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec2 p4 It seems that while the news now still shows a strong seasonality the pacemaker has changed periodic words related to hunting and agriculture have mostly disappeared while mention of the weather has been joined with a sports season At the same time a new set of imported activities has joined the list of events that mark the passing of seasons A full list of all words which have disappeared from or been introduced to the modern <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news can be found in S3 and S4 Datasets bookmark sec018 Comparisons with temperature precipitation and photoperiod bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec3 p1 As we found that the changing of the seasons appears to be marked by new events and activities in the modern news we wished to check if historically the weather might have driven the changes of activity and behaviours throughout the year Essentially are the seasonal patterns found in word frequencies a reflection of the weather or of the time of year To answer this question we first measured the correlation between all periodic words in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> historical news with the time series of daily temperature and photoperiod day length in the respective geographical regions along with a historical records of daily precipitation in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec3 p2 Temperature and photoperiod time series are both very close to sinusoidal with a period of 365 days the first one peaking in late July and the second peaking on June 21st The difference between their phases is approximately a month The variance in temperature can be explained for 73 in the <LOCATION>UK 93</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> by a single Fourier component while the photoperiod is a sine wave by construction Daily precipitation is much less periodic although when smoothed over many contiguous days it does show a clear seasonal pattern peaking in early November bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec3 p3 In the historical <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> news we find that the words with the highest correlation with temperature are cucumber lawn and cricket while the words with the lowest correlation are snow recital and concert Similarly correlation with the photoperiod is highest for the words summer lamb and cricket which is perhaps unsurprising given the high correlation between temperature and photoperiod The highest correlation with precipitation are all words related to raining including rain flood and torrential bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec3 p4 However most words that have a 365 day period peak either in the summer or in the winter It is interesting to observe that the periods when most words peak coincide with the warmest and the coldest time of the year suggesting that activities are driven by temperature rather than by day length Fig 5 bookmark pone 0165736 g005 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 5 bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 sec3 fig1 caption1 p1 Variance explained averaged over all seasonally periodic words and total number of seasonally periodic words peaking per day in a the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus and b the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus compared with the maximum daily temperature and photoperiod in each geographical region respectively Each series is standardized while the two former series were first smoothed using a 15 day centred moving average The grey area represents the 99 confidence interval for the Temperature series We can see that the average variance explained per day and the number of seasonal words peaking per day correlates more closely with the temperature rather than the photoperiod with most words peaking at the warmest and coldest time of the year This suggests that activities are driven by temperature rather than by day length https doi org 10 1371 journal pone 0165736 g005 bookmark sec019 Non Sinusoidal Waveforms bookmark article1 body1 sec5 p1 It should not be surprising that a single Fourier component is not sufficient to explain all the variance in any of our words Indeed this should be expected only for a perfectly sinusoidal and infinite time series Since we have a finite time series and since many of the periodic words do not follow a simple sinusoid we do have various <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> components activated Besides creating the risk of spurious peaks in the spectrum and complicating our estimate of phase this effect also downplays the importance of words that are periodic but not sinusoidal It is important to note that any abrupt change in the time series will introduce some spurious Fourier components bookmark article1 body1 sec5 p2 We are also interested in detecting words that are clearly periodic but have a more complex waveform Examples of the most sinusoidal lamb and least sinusoidal advent time series are shown along with their Fourier spectrum in Fig 6 These can be seen as words whose behaviour needs to be explained by more than one <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> component We do this by computing how much variance of their time series can be explained by combining the five largest <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> components We find that in this way we can explain over 75 of the variation in words such as Christmas and Harvest and around 90 for most month names bookmark pone 0165736 g006 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 6 Examples of sinusoidal and complex waveforms in the time domain and their <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> spectrums from the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus bookmark article1 body1 sec5 fig1 caption1 p1 a shows the most complex periodic waveform advent in the time domain while b shows the corresponding <PERSON>Fourier</PERSON> spectrum where we can see several components are activated c shows the most sinusoidal periodic waveform lamb in the time domain with d showing the corresponding Fourier spectrum where we can see that only one component is strongly activated explaining nearly 80 of the variance in the time domain https doi org 10 1371 journal pone 0165736 g006 bookmark article1 body1 sec5 p3 In order to isolate the words that have a complex waveform from the sinusoidal words we compare the variance explained by the first component with the variance explained by the next four components We find that most calendar events such as the names of each month and festivities like Advent Christmas and Easter have non sinusoidal waveforms Christmas in particular has a nearly triangular wave due to the build up of anticipation in the weeks and months leading up to it followed by an abrupt drop On the other hand words like lamb or cricket do seem to follow a much more sinusoidal pattern being very much related to season or weather bookmark sec020 Cycles of different period bookmark article1 body1 sec5 sec1 p1 Expanding our analysis from focusing on yearly periodicities we can also look at words which follow a longer or shorter cycle than one year The processing steps that are used in our data analysis mean that it may be difficult to reliably detect periods shorter than about a month and longer than a few years This is due to an initial 15 day moving average performed to the word time series and a ten year de trending step used to remove long term changes over the 87 year period we study see Methods for further details Nevertheless our analysis did find strongly periodic words with super annual periods of two and four years as well as strongly periodic words repeating every six months bookmark article1 body1 sec5 sec1 p2 The two and four year periodicities occur within the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus and relate to the political cycle of presidential elections and the midterm elections that happen every four years with a two year offset in the phase between them The word presidential 37 is the most strongly periodic of the words discovered with a four year period peaking in December every fourth year and is supported by many related words with the same period and similar phase including electorate 16 vice 12 nation 8 and contest 7 Similarly every two years we find evidence of another political cycle with words including chairman 20 primary 16 vote 15 support 11 and congress 10 We found no evidence of a similar super annual political cycle within the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> corpus at a five year period as we might expect We believe this is due to snap elections being called or general elections following failure to pass motions of confidence causing the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> general elections to not follow a fixed period bookmark article1 body1 sec5 sec1 p3 At the six month period we see evidence of fashion seasons within the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> with words such as millinery 36 stylish 34 latest 34 trim 33 and many more semantically related words occurring around the same time with peaks around April May and October November each year suggesting there is a Spring Summer fashion season and an Autumn Winter fashion season in effect This is accompanied by the words reduced 26 and clearance 24 also being explained by a six month component with a phase that peaks in January and July each year approximately half way through each fashion season bookmark sec021 Conclusions bookmark article1 body1 sec6 p1 The Fourier analysis of the relative frequency of 50K words over a period of 31 755 days reveals that a significant fraction of these words follows a strongly cyclic behaviour The most common period is 365 days and the most common phases are those peaking in the summer and in the winter The activities underlying the periodic words are often related to the seasons we see names of fruits and flowers outdoor activities agricultural tasks We also see signs of seasonal disease and the strong signals related to calendar driven activities such as Christmas celebrations These general properties can be observed in the time series extracted both from the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corpus and to some extent also in those extracted from modern news Interestingly however many of the underlying drivers have changed in modern times with current periodicities being more informed by events not related to the natural world bookmark article1 body1 sec6 p2 It is tempting to suggest that the pace of human activities is today less strongly set by natural cycles the passage of time in historical newspapers was marked by produce like gooseberries and rhubarb and activities like hunting harvesting and playing cricket or events like lectures and concerts It now appears to rely less on these natural cycles instead introducing new periodic elements to set their pace including <ORGANIZATION>Halloween Santa Claus</ORGANIZATION> Football Championships and summer travel bookmark article1 body1 sec6 p3 Not only does all this provide important material for social scientists and historians to investigate it also shows that collective behaviour in societies does indeed display a periodic pattern and that the analysis of newspaper time series can uncover at least a part of it bookmark article1 body1 sec6 p4 It is also important to observe that the method we have developed for the statistical handling of such a large multiple testing problem is entirely general and therefore could be used in many other domains where massively multivariate time series need to be analysed This may include the detection of cycles in credit card transactions media consumption stock markets bookmark article1 body1 sec6 p5 We expect them to be useful to analyse economic indicators social media and sensor data Among the scientific disciplines that can benefit from our proposed periodic models are fields including economics anthropology social sciences the emerging subfields of culturomics and cliodynamics 44 as well as financial markets analysis to name a few bookmark article1 body1 sec6 p6 We believe that while the automation of text analysis can never replace the role of human scholars it can play an important role in the digital humanities by detecting macroscopic trends that might otherwise go unnoticed bringing them to the attention of the historian or the social scientist bookmark sec022 Supporting Information bookmark pone 0165736 s001 S1 Dataset Periodic words unique to the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> bookmark
