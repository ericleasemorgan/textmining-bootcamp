                <p>A review of Lori Emerson's <cite class="title italic">Reading Writing Interfaces: From
                        The Digital To The Bookbound</cite> (2014). The reviewer highlights
                    Emerson's demands that we uncover and demystify the
                        “invisible” interfaces governing our digital tools and
                    platforms, situates Emerson's work with the larger field of digital humanities,
                    and talks at length about the movie <cite class="title italic">Big</cite>.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">I did not expect a book titled <cite class="title italic">Reading Writing Interfaces: From
                    the Digital to the Bookbound</cite> to announce, on its first page, that it “begins and ends with magic”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, ix]. But Lori Emerson’s convincing argument in favor of “demystifying
                    devices” — as well as their architects and users — is full of parlor tricks
                as well as missing Statues of Liberty, Gob Bluths and David Copperfields [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 9]. Truly, the greatest trick Emerson pulls off is
                convincing the world that the “interface,” a term that sounds
                like something Will Ferrell might have come up with in a <cite class="title italic">Saturday Night Live</cite> George W. Bush sketch, is tied to a rich and
                far-reaching history worth exploring. Rather than “simply that which opens up from one distinct space to
                        another distinct space”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, x], the interface, in Emerson’s hands, is the site which determines the very
                nature of our approach to reading, writing, and navigating the world around us,
                often with an invisible, at times even nefarious, hand.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Thoughts on the relationship between magic and technology have inspired countless
                science fiction novels, comic books, and press releases in recent years. Was it
                Steve Jobs or a character from Warren Ellis and John Cassady’s <cite class="title italic">Planetary</cite> who bragged about the ability to send “a signal to reality’s operating system”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#ellis2001">Ellis et al. 2001</a>, 20]? My favorite story about the intersection between these two
                seemingly-disparate worlds is <cite class="title italic">Big</cite>, the 1988 Hollywood
                fable starring Tom Hanks. The architect of the embiggening that transforms the body
                of thirteen-year-old Josh Baskin (played by David Moscow) into one that resembles an
                Academy-Award-winning adult is Zoltar, a coin-operated machine who promises to grant
                wishes. Zoltar is uncomplicated. He is efficient. He is a literal plot device, an
                animatronic fortune teller that less charitable viewers might find heavy-handed (not
                to mention orientalist, given his turban and robes and angry glowing eyes). But he
                also has a well-designed, intuitive interface: he can be operated by a child with
                minimal prompting or instruction (though Baskin does have to hit the machine a few
                times to get it started). He can only perform limited functions, but his users seem
                to find little reason to pursue other avenues of inquiry. He even provides a
                receipt: a tiny “Zoltar Speaks” card that lets users know their wish has been
                granted. Viewed through the lens of Emerson’s magical thinking, he is also the dream
                of many twenty-first century users of digital technology, a device of seemingly
                limitless possibilities. If only he accepted credit cards. And fit in your
                pocket.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The interface is surprisingly front and center in many parts of <cite class="title italic">Big</cite>. Beyond Zoltar, there is, of course, the famous scene set in New
                York City’s FAO Schwarz (RIP) where Baskin, in the midst of providing UX advice to
                the CEO of the MacMillan Toys Company (Robert Loggia!), literally stumbles across
                the toy store’s “Walking Piano” and “magically” performs two
                musical numbers. While the first steps on the piano are preliminary and cautious,
                Baskin and the CEO quickly master the device, speeding through “Chopsticks” to the delight of the assembled shoppers. The CEO is so
                impressed that he gives Baskin a job on the spot. Like many viewers, “Big Piano”” creator Remo Saraceni sees in <cite class="title italic">Big</cite>
                “a beautiful message of innocence”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#saraceni2008">Saraceni 2008</a>].</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">But what if we do not subscribe to this romantic notion of wisdom inherent in a
                child’s gaze? What if, like Emerson, we are aware of the ways in which “the supposed naturalness of ubicomp-related gestural
                        interfaces is utterly misleading”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 6]? As a kid I was amazed by how quickly this Baskin kid figured out how to play
                the piano: I didn’t have “Chopsticks” up my sleeve,
                because I didn’t grow up in a suburban environment that encouraged and afforded
                piano lessons. While there is some exploratory tinkering in this scene, there is no
                real trial-and-error with the device, no room for failure. These narrative
                trajectories live on in the marketing materials for new devices: for example, who
                could forget the irritating hipster star of an early Google Glass commercial, a man
                who uses his gadgets to track down a <cite class="title italic">Ukelele in A Day</cite>
                book and broadcast his fast and easy mastery of the instrument (with a New York City
                skyline backdrop, at sunset no less!) to impress his significant other? Why be John
                Cusack at the end of <cite class="title italic">Say Anything</cite> when you could buy a
                device that turns you into Peter Gabriel in less than 24 hours? </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The last technological interface to be introduced in <cite class="title italic">Big</cite>
                remains in production limbo by the end of the film. As a kid, Baskin’s dream of the
                ultimate comic – one with a “choose-your-own-adventure” interface
                that allows readers to pursue a wider range of stories than you’d generally find in
                a single issue – fascinated me. As his coworker Susan notes, “the kid makes his own decision”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#big1988">Big 1988</a>]. That the comic’s target demographic will inevitably run out of stories is
                touted as a feature, not a bug: when someone asks what happens when a reader
                exhausts the options stored on the device’s computer chip, Susan replies that “you
                    just sell different adventures.” Instead of spending a dollar for 22 pages of
                a single story, children (and their parents!) now have the option of shelling out
                $19 for the illusion of choice [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#big1988">Big 1988</a>].</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Josh Baskin leaves before finishing his presentation on his digital comic book,
                deciding to return to the Zoltar machine and overwrite his initial wish with a wish
                to return to childhood. It’s interesting that the film chooses to stage his retreat
                at the moment when he is on the cusp of solving the problem he faced at the
                beginning of the film. The very first image we see in <cite class="title italic">Big</cite> is, perhaps surprisingly, a computer screen. “YOU ARE STANDING IN
                    THE CAVERN OF THE EVIL WIZARD,” it reads, underneath an image of said wizard.
                    “ALL AROUND YOU ARE THE CARCASSES OF SLAIN DWARFS.” Called to action by the
                game, Baskin types, “MELT WIZARD.” The program requires a more specific
                command. The boy seems frustrated: the thermal pod his digital avatar carries in his
                hand seems to be the obvious tool of destruction, yet it ends up dying when his
                follow-up response is delayed by a request from his mother to take out the trash
                    [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#big1988">Big 1988</a>]. Baskin spends a significant portion of his time at
                MacMillan Toys designing a more engaging, more intuitive, more mobile version of
                this story; one that might, for instance, anticipate a user’s need to pause while he
                or she is being yelled at by their parents. Was the project a failure, too
                cost-prohibitive, not innovative enough? Are we expected to read in the immediate
                consideration of the economics of such a device the ways in which innovation is
                limited by market forces? <cite class="title italic">Big</cite> is obviously more
                interested in imagining the possibilities of toys designed by children, warts and

                    Emerson revel in various acts and performances of failure. They unlock the black
                    boxes of proprietary hardware and software and force the contents found therein
                    to misbehave. They pull algorithms kicking and screaming into the light of day.
                    They create works that stretch across all corners of our material landscapes,
                    messy portraits smeared with the fingerprints of their creators and the marks of
                    their tools of composition. Unlike most project managers, librarians, or
                    developers, artists can devote their energies to producing work “that is deliberately difficult to navigate or whose
                            interfaces are anything but user-friendly”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 4]. But as Padilla suggests, maybe there is a need for more time, labor, and
                    institutional support devoted to explorations of difficulty and experimentation
                    in design. Maybe a wider range of digital humanists can productively resist or
                    critique user preferences for the invisible if they, like the artists featured

                    us, almost frustratingly so. Instructors are often strongly encouraged or even
                    required to use Canvas and Blackboard: content management systems that seem
                    designed to punish students. If your university library has decided to invest
                    more in digital ebooks than physical copies, you have likely had a great time
                    doing research in Ebrary’s web interface, apparently invented by someone who
                    hates to read. And many digital humanists have likely heard the sounds of
                    snickering from the snarkier non-DH faculty members in the room while you’ve
                    stared with horror at an unfamiliar projector interface just before the job
                    talk, or when said interface decides all of a sudden that the commands it
                    prompts you to follow are more recommendations than directives for how the
                    display might be turned on. Perhaps we’ve used words like
                        “intuitive” or “clean” to describe our
                    preferred alternatives to these technological monstrosities. Emerson is here to

                        and task oriented” devices and interfaces we are familiar with
                    today [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 77]. By closely examining the rise of
                        “user-friendly” graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the
                    pedagogical impulses guiding the creation and dissemination of the Logo
                    programming language and Smalltalk software initiatives of the 1970s and the ad
                    campaigns for the Apple Macintosh (among other texts and archival materials),
                    Emerson documents the messy recent history that preceded our sleeker, flatter,
                    dull monoculture governed by increasingly narrower principles of design. Her
                    work makes visible the contradictions inherent in Apple’s victorious “gloss over the aggressively closed architecture of the
                            Macintosh while marketing it as a democratic computer ‘for the
                            people’”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 80]. Whereas the opportunities to bridge the distance between user and
                    interface once invited a variety of designs and methods, these roads have been
                    paved over to favor the more immediate needs of businesses and consumers. This
                    history is particularly compelling to readers too young, too tuned out, or too
                    not-alive to have experienced it firsthand, and its presence here may be useful
                    to readers more preoccupied with the apparent benefits of the user-friendly
                    world we presently inhabit.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Early in <cite class="title italic">Reading Writing Interfaces</cite>, Emerson notes
                    that she is not “arguing wholesale against user-friendly interfaces that seek
                        to be invisible” but is instead criticizing the privileging of
                        “transparency” as a design mandate “valued above all else”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, xi]. She laments the lost possibilities of a present governed by
                        “multifunctional, generative devices for reading as well as writing or
                        producing content” instead of the “appliances for the consumption of
                        content” we keep on us at all times [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, xi–xii]. In the texts and material contexts of works produced by
                    Emily Dickinson and concrete poets like bpNichol, she finds not digital
                    antecedents but “antidotes for the Interface-Free”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 140]. “Why do we lure ourselves into believing that these
                            interfaces offer us the ability to somehow transcend the interface
                            itself and not understand that they instead offer us an increasingly
                            difficult to pin down, perhaps even insidious form of control on our
                            creative expression?”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mcgrath-reappearing.html#emerson2014">Emerson 2014</a>, 144]. What if we did more than wait passively for the equivalent of Zoltar and
                    his invisible hand? What if we spent less time reveling in the clean, white,
                    endless expanses of Apple and Google commercials and instead took a closer look
                    at the economic and human costs of the labor generating our devices? What if it
                    was OK to pursue creative endeavors that called attention to their present and
                    attendant material conditions, instead of wasting time writing and making
                    excuses for sententious, pretentious trash? </div>

                    productively call attention to ideas of the interface in my academic writings
                    and teaching materials. Within my immediate institutional context as an
                    instructor in Public Humanities, it has provided me with a useful framework to
                    help students and faculty members think more about the design principles
                    motivating their digital projects (as well as my own). Beyond professional
                    applications, it points the way towards new weapons to help in the war against
                    the wizards who are transforming the digital spaces we share into
