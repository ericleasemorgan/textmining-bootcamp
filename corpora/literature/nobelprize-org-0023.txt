Award Ceremony Speech


  Speech by Professor Sture Allén,
  Permanent Secretary of the Swedish
  Academy

  

  Translation from the Swedish text


  Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses,
  Ladies and Gentlemen,

  

  The Nobel Prize awarded by the Swedish Academy is, as we know, a
  literary prize. This year it has been granted to Toni Morrison,
  making her the ninetieth Nobel Laureate in Literature.


  In her volume of essays, Playing in the
  Dark, Miss Morrison lucidly pictures the insights that she
  has gained, as an author and a reader in her native country: "It
  is as if I had been looking at a fishbowl - the glide and flick
  of the golden scales, the green tip, the bolt of white careening
  back from the gills; the castles at the bottom, surrounded by
  pebbles and tiny, intricate fronds of green; the barely disturbed
  water, the flecks of waste and food, the tranquil bubbles
  travelling to the surface - and suddenly I saw the bowl, the
  structure that transparently (and invisibly) permits the ordered
  life it contains to exist in the larger world." In other words,
  she regards the African presence in her country as a vital but
  unarticulated prerequisite for the fulfilment of the American
  dream. Similarly, she sees whiteness in literature as having
  blackness as its constant companion, the racial other as its
  shadow.


  In her depictions of the world of the black
  people, in life as in legend, Toni Morrison has given the
  Afro-American people their history back, piece by piece. In this
  perspective, her work is uncommonly consonant. At the same time,
  it is richly variegated. The reader derives vast pleasure from
  her superb narrative technique, shifting from novel to novel and
  marked by original development, although it is related to
  Faulkner and
  to the Latin American tradition. Toni Morrison's novels invite
  the reader to partake at many levels, and at varying degrees of
  complexity. Still, the most enduring impression they leave is of
  empathy, compassion with one's fellow human beings.


  Milkman Dead, the protagonist of Song of
  Solomon, reflects one of the basic themes of Miss Morrison's
  novels, in his quest for self. Milkman's paternal grandfather was
  a liberated slave. When he was registering his freedom, he
  responded to a question about his father with the word "Dead",
  thus acquiring his macabre surname from the drunken official who
  asked. His family was prepared to accept this name: "It was new
  and would wipe out the past. Wipe it all out." The Solomon whose
  name occurs in the title of the novel, Milkman's peculiar
  southern forefather, was to be found even in the song that went
  with children's games. The intensity of his inner life had
  carried him through the air back to the Africa of his origins.
  Solomon's rapture was ultimately Milkman's as well.


  Motifs in space and time continue to be
  interwoven in Beloved. Paradoxically, the combination of
  realism and folklore enhances the novel's credibility. In the
  world which the female protagonist, Sethe, inhabits, one does not
  possess one's own body. There is tremendous power in Toni
  Morrison's description of Sethe's act of releasing her child,
  Beloved, from the destiny she imagines her facing, and of the
  consequences of this act for her own life, in which Beloved's
  double personifies the burden of Sethe's guilt.


  In her latest novel, Jazz, Toni
  Morrison's approach is similar to the style in which jazz is
  performed. The opening lines of the novel state its theme, the
  lives of a number of people in Harlem in the 1920s. In the course
  of the novel we perceive a first-person narrator, varying,
  supplementing and intensifying the story. The final picture is a
  highly composite image of events, characters and atmospheres,
  mediated in sensual language with a deep inherent sense of
  musicality. Toni Morrison's way of addressing her reader has a
  compelling lustre, in a poetic direction.


  When she was very young, her family's
  landlord set fire to the house in which they lived when her
  parents fell behind with the rent. And while they were in it. Her
  family reacted to this absurd form of crudeness, monumental
  crudeness, not with resignation but with laughter. This, says
  Toni Morrison, is how you can distance yourself from the act and
  take your life back. You take your integrity back.


  In great minds, gravity and humour are
  close neighbours. This is reflected in everything Toni Morrison
  has written, and evidenced in her own summary: "My project rises
  from delight, not disappointment."


   


  Dear Miss Morrison,

  

  I have just told the audience that, in your own words, your
  project rises from delight, not disappointment. As you disclose
  fundamental aspects of hidden reality, you make gravity and
  humour abide side by side in your remarkable work, with its
  verbal music. It is my privilege and pleasure, on behalf of the
  Swedish Academy, to convey to you our warmest congratulations on
  the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1993, and to invite you to
  receive the Prize from the hands of His Majesty the King.
