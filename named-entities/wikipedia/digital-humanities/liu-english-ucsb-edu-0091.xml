and Future of the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities Modern Language Association</ORGANIZATION> convention <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> 7 January 2011 The paper was delivered in truncated improvised form at the actual event due to time constraints An expanded version of this paper full text was later published under the same title in Debates in the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities ed Matthew K Gold Minneapolis University of Minnesota Press</ORGANIZATION> 2012 490 509 This is the occasion to announce the new initiative titled 4Humanities Advocating for the Humanities which is subtitled Powered by the <ORGANIZATION>International Digital Humanities Community</ORGANIZATION> The site which I and a collective of digital humanists in the <ORGANIZATION>U S Canada U K</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> started in November 2010 in the wake of discussion on the Humanist List about whether the digital humanities had become too industrialised and about the budget cuts in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> is a platform for advocacy statements for the humanities and other forms of showcasing the value of the humanities The premise of the site is that the digital humanities have a special role to play today in helping the humanities communicate in contemporary media networks Let me read the first and last paragraphs from the Mission Statement of 4Humanities as a springboard for the thesis I want to offer about the future of the digital humanities 4Humanities is a site created by the international community of digital humanities scholars and educators to assist in advocacy for the humanities Government and private support for the humanities for research teaching preservation and creative renewal in such fields as literature history languages philosophy classics art history cultural studies libraries and so on are in decline In some nations especially since the economic recession that started in 2007 the decline has resulted in major cuts in government and university funding Leaders of society and business stake all the future on innovative and entrepreneurial discoveries in science engineering biomedicine green technology and so on But the humanities contribute the needed perspective training in complex human phenomena and communication skills needed to spark understand and make human the new discoveries In the process they themselves discover new and also very old ways to be human They do so through their unique contribution of the wisdom of the past awareness of other cultures in the present and imagination of innovative and fair futures Many people care about the humanities not just in the educational and cultural institutions directly affected by the recent cutbacks but also in business government science media politics the professions and the general public They believe that society will be poorer not richer without the humanities to help us grasp and evolve what it means to be human and humane in today s complex world 4Humanities began because the digital humanities community which specializes in making creative use of digital technology to advance humanities research and teaching as well as to think about the basic nature of the new media and technologies woke up to its special potential and responsibility to assist humanities advocacy The digital humanities are increasingly integrated in the humanities at large They catch the eye of administrators and funding agencies who otherwise dismiss the humanities as yesterday s news They connect across disciplines with science and engineering fields They have the potential to use new technologies to help the humanities communicate with and adapt to contemporary society The thesis I offer today which can be titled interrogatively Where is Cultural Criticism in the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> begins with the observation that the past tense sentence embedded in the last paragraph here the digital humanities community woke up to its special potential and responsibility to assist humanities advocacy is actually still counter factual It s vaporware In outline form my thesis is as follows 1 In the digital humanities cultural criticism in both its interpretive and advocacy modes has been noticeably absent by comparison with the mainstream humanities or even more strikingly with new media studies populated as the latter is by net critics tactical media critics hacktivists and so on We digital humanists develop tools data metadata and archives critically and we have also developed critical positions on the nature of such resources e g disputing whether computational methods are best used for truth finding or as <PERSON>Lisa Samuels</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerome McGann</PERSON> put it deformation But rarely do we extend the issues involved into the register of society economics politics or culture in the vintage manner for instance of the <ORGANIZATION>Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR</ORGANIZATION> How the digital humanities advance channel or resist the great postindustrial neoliberal corporatist and globalist flows of information cum capital for instance is a question rarely heard in the digital humanities associations conferences journals and projects with which I am familiar Not even the clich d forms of such issues e g the digital divide privacy copyright and so on get much play 2 Of course cultural criticism in the humanities is not without its problems some of which I have written about elsewhere and will not rehearse here But I call special attention on the present occasion to the problem of the lack of cultural criticism in the digital humanities because I fear that this lack will stunt the growth of our field I say this for two reasons One concerns how the digital humanities will henceforth contribute methodologically to the humanities at large Consider for example that the table in literary studies has now been set for a broad debate between close reading and distant reading Several panels at last year s and this year s MLA bear on this debate including the one this Sunday at noon titled So Close and Yet So Far Close Reading and Sociology The digital humanities have a place at this table as emblematized for instance in the ongoing collaboration between <PERSON>Franco Moretti</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matthew Jockers</PERSON> at the Stanford Literature Lab All those lonely decades of work on text analysis text encoding metadata protocols and so on have finally earned digital humanists an invite to the main meal just when all humanists are discovering that they have to digest for example <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> s recently released Ngram analytics for 500 billion words But consider also the nature of the scholarly works that have so far had the greatest impact on the mainstream humanities in regard to the close reading vs distant reading debate to name just two instances <PERSON>Moretti</PERSON> s Graphs Maps Trees and <PERSON>Pascale Casanova</PERSON> s The World Republic of Letters Both these remarkable books embed their analytical methods within frames of cultural analysis specifically a threefold mix of Braudelian or Annales historiography Marxist sociology e g <ORGANIZATION>Casanova</ORGANIZATION> s <PERSON>Immanuel Wallerstein</PERSON> like center vs periphery breakdown of the world literary system and comparatism on a world or global scale To my digital humanities colleagues in this room let me say that while we have the tools and the data we will not even be in the same league as <PERSON>Moretti Casanova</PERSON> and others unless we can move seamlessly between text analysis and cultural analysis After all it can be said that digital materials on the scale of corpuses databases distributed repositories and so on some of the specialties of the digital humanities are ipso facto cultural phenomena <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> says it they call their Ngram interface to <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> Books a contribution to culturonomics And new media studies says it Lev Manovich and <PERSON>Jeremy Douglass</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego Software Studies Program</ORGANIZATION> for instance are well advanced in developing what they call cultural analytics Where are the digital humanists in the picture To be an equal partner rather than again just a servant at the table digital humanists will need to find ways to show that thinking critically about metadata for instance scales into thinking critically about the power finance and other governance protocols of the world Which brings me to my second reason for thinking that the lack of cultural criticism in the digital humanities might stunt the field s future growth There is one servant role that I do not think the digital humanities should shirk as its unique contribution to the mainstream humanities service as literal as running the actual servers if need be toward advocating the humanities in its present moment of need which is also the moment of immense changes in the communication and information networks connecting the humanities to the public for which traditional humanities communication forms e g monographs are poorly suited Currently the digital humanities are poised to make the jump from a niche field to a field of fields seen to affect research and teaching throughout the mainstream humanities But joining the mainstream I think should not be the limit of our ambitions in the digital humanities Truly to contribute I believe the digital humanities will need to show that it can also take a leadership role The obvious leadership role at present is service for the cause of the humanities Now that the humanities are being systematically or catastrophically defunded by nations states and universities the digital humanities can best serve the humanities by helping it communicate in the new arena of networked and social public knowledge helping it showcase its unique value and helping it partner across disciplines with the STEM sciences in grand challenge projects deemed valuable by the public and its leaders For example and here I will conclude there is not a single grand challenge announced by the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Engineering the Gates Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and other agencies or foundations in the areas of energy environment biomedicine food water education and so on that does not require humanistic and digital humanistic involvement All these issues have a necessary cultural dimension whether as cause or effect and all therefore need humanities and increasingly digital humanities participants Distinguished Professor
