<h2>Workshop Description</h2>
<p>
The growing importance of electronic media for storing and
exchanging text documents has led to a growing interest in
tools and approaches for dealing with unstructured
or semi-structured information included in the text documents.
In addition to well-organized and maintained text databases,
one of the important sources of textual information is the
World Wide Web which is expected to continue to grow in the number
of users and amount of information available.

<p>
Methods developed for mining structured and unstructured
data sets as well as text learning and natural language
processing techniques are essential for analysis of textual data.
While many approaches to text processing are based on
statistics and thus only weakly dependent on the language
the data is written in, those that involve deeper linguistic
processing are typically aimed at English texts. Furthermore,
an important step towards exploiting information from texts
is automated information extraction from large document sets
and building more or less domain specific knowledge bases.

<p>
This leads to interesting and important questions of scalability
of developed approaches and their applicability to a variety
of document formats and languages.

<h2>Topics of interest</h2>

<p>
The objective of this workshop is to enable presentation and 
exchange of ideas on various aspects of Text Mining.
Our desire is to facilitate communication among researchers 
and practitioners from related and complementary
research areas, who are working on similar problems
but with possibly different focus and problem solving approaches.
More precisely, we invite papers from the four areas:
<ul>
  <li>Text Mining (or Text Learning) <strong>(TM)</strong> 
  <li>Information Retrieval <strong>(IR)</strong> 
  <li>Natural Language Processing <strong>(NLP)</strong> 
  <li>Information Extraction <strong>(IE)</strong>.
</ul>

Particular topics of interest for the workshop include
but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li> text mining & information retrieval
  <li> text mining & natural language processing
  <li> text mining & web mining
  <li> text representation
  <li> text categorization
  <li> text segmentation
  <li> information extraction
  <li> scalability of developed approaches
  <li> performance evaluation measures
  <li> feature selection
  <li> multilingual approaches to text mining
  <li> influence of domain and domain specific text mining
  <li> innovative applications of text mining.
</ul>

<h2>Invited Talks</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Invited talk by Ronen Feldman</strong>:
  "Text Mining: Opportunities and Challenges"

<p>
  The information age has made it easy to receive and store large 
  amounts of data. The proliferation of documents available - on the Web, 
  in corporate intranets, on news wires and elsewhere - is overwhelming. 
  However, while the amount of data available to us is forever increasing, 
  our ability to absorb and process this information has remained constant. 
  Search engines only exacerbate the problem by making more and more 
  documents available in a matter of a few keystrokes; so-called "push" 
  technology makes the problem even worse by constantly reminding us that 
  we are failing to follow critical news, events, and trends. 
  We experience information overload, and miss important patterns even 
  as they unfold before us.

<p>
  Text Mining is a new and exciting area of research that tackles 
  this problem through techniques borrowed from data mining, 
  machine learning, information retrieval, natural-language understanding, 
  case-based reasoning, statistics, and knowledge management to help people
  gain rapid insight into large quantities of semi-structured or 
  unstructured text. Typically, it involves preprocessing a document 
  collection (e.g., through text categorization or term extraction), 
  storing , indexing and analyzing the intermediate representations 
  (through distribution analysis, document clustering, trend analysis, 
  and association rule discovery), and presenting the results graphically.

<p>
  In my talk I will present some of the new challenges facing the 
  text mining community, with particular focus on the representation 
  of documents and the ability to provide better insights into document 
  collections. I will also try to provide a consumer perspective into 
  text mining while reviewing the business opportunities that currently 
  exist in this area.

<p>
  <strong>Invited talk by David Lewis</strong>:
  "ATTICS: A Toolkit for Text Classification and Text Mining"

<p>
  ATTICS is an extensible text classification system recently implemented 
  in C++ at AT&T Labs and available for research purposes. In spirit it 
  is a hybrid between text retrieval systems such as SMART and machine 
  learning toolkits such as MLC++. The design, data model, and emphasis 
  on online classifier application are unusual for either type of software.
  While ATTICS is primarily intended for online text classification, 
  its flexible architecture and support for both textual and non-textual 
  data make it applicable to many text mining tasks. I will discuss 
  how ATTICS can be used for text mining, and when it is or isn't a better 
  choice than other tools.

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>
Attendance is not limited to the paper authors.
We strongly encourage interested researchers from related
areas to attend the workshop.
One of the objectives of the workshop is to 
promote the interaction among reseachers and 
the development of the text mining area of research.
