centuries by analyzing large textual time series specifically digitized books This method promises to empower scholars with a quantitative and data driven tool to study culture and society but its power has been limited by the use of data from books and simple analytics based essentially on word counts This study addresses these problems by assembling a vast corpus of regional newspapers from the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> incorporating very fine grained geographical and temporal information that is not available for books The corpus spans 150 years and is formed by millions of articles representing 14 of all British regional outlets of the period Simple content analysis of this corpus allowed us to detect specific events like wars epidemics coronations or conclaves with high accuracy whereas the use of more refined techniques from artificial intelligence enabled us to move beyond counting words by detecting references to named entities These techniques allowed us to observe both a systematic underrepresentation and a steady increase of women in the news during the 20th century and the change of geographic focus for various concepts We also estimate the dates when electricity overtook steam and trains overtook horses as a means of transportation both around the year 1900 along with observing other cultural transitions We believe that these data driven approaches can complement the traditional method of close reading in detecting trends of continuity and change in historical corpora KEYWORDS Culturomics artificial intelligence computational history

the steady decline of steam and the rise of electricity B the waning popularity of horses and the increase in trains C the rate of uptake for different communication technologies D the economy as a concept beginning in late Victorian times after a decline in political economy and E that the four largest peaks for panic correspond with negative market movements linked to banking crises in 1826 1847 1857 and 1866 Content analysis of 150 years of British periodicals Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2017 Jan 24 114 4 E457 E465 image Fig 4 Fig 4 Social change and popular culture n Gram trends showing that A unrest corresponds with well known periods of social tension whereas revolt corresponds with tension in British colonies B the suffragette movement falls within a delimited time interval C slavery includes the movement for abolitionism and the American Civil War whereas anarchist corresponds to the heyday of concern over anarchist direct action before the rise of fascism and bolshevism D the gender gap in mentions of men and women is closing with women making advances during the two wars E the gender gap is also closing when measured using the pronouns he and she F actors singers and dancers begin to increase in the 1890s rising significantly thereafter whereas references to politicians by contrast gradually decline from the early 20th century and G football is more prominent than cricket from 1909 on Content analysis of 150 years of British periodicals Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2017 Jan 24 114 4 E457 E465 image Fig 5 Fig 5 People in history A Replicating the study on famous personalities by occupation using all extracted entities associated with a <ORGANIZATION>Wikipedia</ORGANIZATION> entry we found that politicians and writers are most likely to achieve notoriety within their lifetimes whereas scientists and mathematicians are less likely to achieve fame but decline less sharply B We computed the probability that a given reference to a person is to a male or a female person We find that although males are more present than females during the entire period under investigation there is a slow but steady increase of the presence of women after 1900 although it is difficult to attribute this to a single factor at the time Content analysis of 150 years of British periodicals Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2017 Jan 24 114 4 E457 E465 image Fig 6 Fig 6
