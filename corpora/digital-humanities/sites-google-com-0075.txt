About
Cultural Analytics 2017 was a two-day symposium (May 26-27, 2017) devoted to new research in the fields of computational and data-intensive cultural studies. Combining methods and insights from computer science and the quantitative social sciences with questions central to the interpretive humanities, the event explored some of the most compelling contemporary interdisciplinary work in a rigorous, collegial environment.
The symposium is now over, but you can see a list of talks and videos on the Schedule page and read more about the presenters on the Participants page. You can also download a poster to commemorate the event.
