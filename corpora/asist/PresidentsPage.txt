I have so many great developments to share with you in thisissue of my column. Top on my list is the hire of ASIS&T’s
new executive director – Lydia Middleton
(www.linkedin.com/in/lydiamiddleton/). I am thrilled to
welcome Lydia to ASIS&T. Lydia’s first day with us was on
May 8. I have had the opportunity to orient Lydia with
ASIS&T and to work with her in the ASIS&T office in Silver
Spring, Maryland, in May, and it has been a fulfilling and
worthwhile experience. 
Lydia joins ASIS&T at a critical juncture in our history –

the 80th anniversary and the end of Dick Hill’s 27 years as
executive director, which brought growth and financial
stability to the Association. She is poised to lead and manage
ASIS&T, being guided by its strategic plan, which includes
membership growth, a stronger global presence, greater
opportunities to connect academic and professional interests,
pursuit of new sources of revenue, and implementation of new
modes of communication and engagement with technology to
support member interests. Lydia not only values the diversity
of ASIS&T staff and members, but also looks forward to
enhancing the Association’s value to its members and its
presence in our professional and academic communities.
As a member of the ASIS&T Executive Director Search

Committee, I want to take this opportunity to thank Sandy
Hirsh and Clara Chu, co-chairs of the Search Committee;
the other Search Committee members – Jamshid Beheshti,
Nadia Caidi, Lisa Given and Marjorie Hlava; and the
executive search firm, Isaccson Miller, whose expertise and

We are very
excited to

announce our two
keynote speakers

Meeting – 
Richard Marks
and William

Powers.

excellent service throughout
the search was key to our
success in identifying
qualified candidates and in
hiring Lydia. The committee
thanks the ASIS&T staff and
members for their valuable
input during the search
process. Two hundred fifty-
two individuals were
considered in the search
either as sources or as
candidates.This appointment
may be one of the most critical decisions of my presidential term
and I feel privileged to have been a part of this important hire.
I also have had the opportunity to work with our ASIS&T

Annual Meeting co-chairs and 80th Anniversary Advisory
Group members. We are very excited to announce our two
keynote speakers for the Annual Meeting – Richard Marks
and William Powers. Marks is the head of Playstation Magic
Lab at Sony Interactive Entertainment. His area of expertise is
social aspects of virtual reality and augmented reality. Powers
is the best-selling author of Hamlet’s Blackberry and research
scientist at MIT Media Lab. His area of expertise is work-life
balance in a technologically connected world. 
The members of the 80th Anniversary Advisory Group have

been busy planning the Annual Meeting. This group is chaired by
Kathryn La Barre and members include Michael Buckland,
Toni Carbo, Ken Herold, Dania Bilal, Javed Mostafa,
Nouf Khashman and Tatjana Aparac. Details about our
invited 80th Anniversary-themed panel session will be available
soon, and the plans for the 80th Anniversary-themed Welcome
Reception are ongoing. Please forward names of ASIS&T
friends and members who have died recently to Kathryn at
klabarre<at>illinois.edu to be honored with a moment of silence
at the reception. Time will be devoted during the reception to

honor Gene Garfield’s
contributions to ASIS&T.
Kathryn also is facilitating
efforts to create an
interactive exhibit honoring
80 years of ASIS&T to debut
at the reception and to be
available throughout the
conference. If you have
images, videos or audio you
would like to share, please
contact her at
klabarre<at>illinois.edu

Our ASIS&T members in Asia also have been quite busy. I
was invited to spend two weeks (March 26-April 7) at the
University of Hong Kong as a visiting professor in the Faculty of
Education, working with the master of library and information
management (MLIM) program faculty and students. I began
my visit by participating in the two-day Symposium on
Research Design, Paper Writing, and Publishing in
Information Science that was hosted at HKU and sponsored
by the ASIS&T Asia Pacific Chapter (Christopher Khoo,
chair) and the Taipei Chapter (Ming-Hsin Phoebe Chiu,
chair, and Tien-I Tsai, vice-chair), and Sam Chu (paper co-
chair for the ASIS&T 2017 Annual Meeting). I discussed
qualitative research methods and also had the opportunity to
lead a breakout session with students. The students discussed
their research, and I provided feedback on how to make the
paper publishable in the ASIS&T journal, JASIST, and/or to
submit a paper for review for the ASIS&T 2017 Annual
Meeting. I am thrilled to report that one of the doctoral
students in my breakout session did submit a paper proposal
for the ASIS&T 2017 Annual Meeting. I hope it gets accepted!
Javed Mostafa, the editor of JASIST, also attended the
symposium and advised students and faculty on preparing
and submitting papers for review for publication in JASIST.

Since ASIS&T is 
a prominent

society for the
advancement of

information
science and

technology, we
officially

partnered with
the American

Association for
the Advancement
of Science (AAAS)
and the Earth Day
Network for the

March for Science.

During my two-week visit, I was honored to meet with
many students, faculty and practicing professionals in Hong
Kong and Macau. Dr. Chu made sure I worked and played
hard. He scheduled hikes with students and faculty so I was
able to work in a beautiful outdoor environment with
stimulating discussions. I learned so much from everyone and
got to do so with wonderful colleagues in a gorgeous setting
while eating delicious food!
When I returned from Hong Kong, Nadia Caidi, ASIS&T

past president, and I attended the Council for Scientific
Society Presidents meeting in Washington, D.C., May 6-8.
This meeting is an opportunity for ASIS&T presidents to meet
with presidents and executive directors of other scientific
associations. It’s good to share challenges and opportunities
and learn about different ways to lead change. The speakers
are excellent, and this year we heard speakers from Harvard,
Yale, Rutgers Universities; the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the University of California, Berkeley, National
Public Radio, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the
National Institutes of Health, as well as other government
scientific agencies. The speakers introduced such diverse
topics as the factors that count as evidence in the world of fake

news, the current challenges facing the sciences, building with
3-D printed renewable resources (building with recycled
tires), 3-D cell neurobiology and gene editing, computer
models, the national strategy to improve safety testing
(addressed testing skin lotions, perfumes and so forth) and
data-driven public engagement initiatives. Nadia, Lydia and I
attended the Kavli Lecture to hear George M. Church,
professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and professor
of health sciences and technology at Harvard and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also is
director of the U.S. Department of Energy Center on
Bioenergy at Harvard and MIT and director of the National
Institutes of Health Center of Excellence in Genomic Science
at Harvard. We even had a photo op with Dr. Church!
