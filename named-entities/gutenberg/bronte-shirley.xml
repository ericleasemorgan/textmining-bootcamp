XXXVI WRITTEN IN THE SCHOOLROOM 534 XXXVII THE WINDING UP 555 SHIRLEY CHAPTER I LEVITICAL Of late years an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> they lie very thick on the hills every parish has one or more of them they are young enough to be very active and ought to be doing a great deal of good But not of late years are we about to speak we are going back to the beginning of this century late years present years are dusty sunburnt hot arid we will evade the noon forget it in siesta pass the midday in slumber and dream of dawn If you think from this prelude that anything like a romance is preparing for you reader you never were more mistaken Do you anticipate sentiment and poetry and reverie Do you expect passion and stimulus and melodrama Calm your expectations reduce them to a lowly standard Something real cool and solid lies before you something unromantic as Monday morning when all who have work wake with the consciousness that they must rise and betake themselves thereto It is not positively affirmed that you shall not have a taste of the exciting perhaps towards the middle and close of the meal but it is resolved that the first dish set upon the table shall be one that a Catholic ay even an <ORGANIZATION>Anglo Catholic</ORGANIZATION> might eat on Good Friday in Passion Week it shall be cold lentils and vinegar without oil it shall be unleavened bread with bitter herbs and no roast lamb Of late years I say an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> but in eighteen hundred eleven twelve that affluent rain had not descended Curates were scarce then there was no Pastoral Aid no Additional Curates Society to stretch a helping hand to worn out old rectors and incumbents and give them the wherewithal to pay a vigorous young colleague from <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> The present successors of the apostles disciples of Dr <PERSON>Pusey</PERSON> and tools of the Propaganda were at that time being hatched under cradle blankets or undergoing regeneration by nursery baptism in wash hand basins You could not have guessed by looking at any one of them that the Italian ironed double frills of its net cap surrounded the brows of a preordained specially sanctified successor of <ORGANIZATION>St Paul St Peter</ORGANIZATION> or St John nor could you have foreseen in the folds of its long night gown the white surplice in which it was hereafter cruelly to exercise the souls of its parishioners and strangely to nonplus its old fashioned vicar by flourishing aloft in a pulpit the shirt like raiment which had never before waved higher than the reading desk Yet even in those days of scarcity there were curates the precious plant was rare but it might be found A certain favoured district in the <LOCATION>West Riding of Yorkshire</LOCATION> could boast three rods of <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> blossoming within a circuit of twenty miles You shall see them reader Step into this neat garden house on the skirts of <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> walk forward into the little parlour There they are at dinner Allow me to introduce them to you Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> curate of Whinbury Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> curate of Briarfield Mr Sweeting curate of Nunnely These are Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> s lodgings being the habitation of one <PERSON>John Gale</PERSON> a small clothier Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> has kindly invited his brethren to regale with him You and I will join the party see what is to be seen and hear what is to be heard At present however they are only eating and while they eat we will talk aside These gentlemen are in the bloom of youth they possess all the activity of that interesting age an activity which their moping old vicars would fain turn into the channel of their pastoral duties often expressing a wish to see it expended in a diligent superintendence of the schools and in frequent visits to the sick of their respective parishes But the youthful <PERSON>Levites</PERSON> feel this to be dull work they prefer lavishing their energies on a course of proceeding which though to other eyes it appear more heavy with _ennui_ more cursed with monotony than the toil of the weaver at his loom seems to yield them an unfailing supply of enjoyment and occupation I allude to a rushing backwards and forwards amongst themselves to and from their respective lodgings not a round but a triangle of visits which they keep up all the year through in winter spring summer and autumn Season and weather make no difference with unintelligible zeal they dare snow and hail wind and rain mire and dust to go and dine or drink tea or sup with each other What attracts them it would be difficult to say It is not friendship for whenever they meet they quarrel It is not religion the thing is never named amongst them theology they may discuss occasionally but piety never It is not the love of eating and drinking each might have as good a joint and pudding tea as potent and toast as succulent at his own lodgings as is served to him at his brother s <PERSON>Mrs Gale Mrs Hogg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs Whipp</PERSON> their respective landladies affirm that it is just for naught else but to give folk trouble By folk the good ladies of course mean themselves for indeed they are kept in a continual fry by this system of mutual invasion Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> and his guests as I have said are at dinner <PERSON>Mrs Gale</PERSON> waits on them but a spark of the hot kitchen fire is in her eye She considers that the privilege of inviting a friend to a meal occasionally without additional charge a privilege included in the terms on which she lets her lodgings has been quite sufficiently exercised of late The present week is yet but at Thursday and on Monday Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> the curate of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> came to breakfast and stayed dinner on Tuesday Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> of Nunnely came to tea remained to supper occupied the spare bed and favoured her with their company to breakfast on Wednesday morning now on Thursday they are both here at dinner and she is almost certain they will stay all night C en est trop she would say if she could speak French Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> is mincing the slice of roast beef on his plate and complaining that it is very tough Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> says the beer is flat Ay that is the worst of it if they would only be civil <PERSON>Mrs Gale</PERSON> wouldn t mind it so much if they would only seem satisfied with what they get she wouldn t care but these young parsons is so high and so scornful they set everybody beneath their fit They treat her with less than civility just because she doesn t keep a servant but does the work of the house herself as her mother did afore her then they are always speaking against <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> ways and <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> folk and by that very token <PERSON>Mrs Gale</PERSON> does not believe one of them to be a real gentleman or come of gentle kin The old parsons is worth the whole lump of college lads they know what belongs to good manners and is kind to high and low More bread cries Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> in a tone which though prolonged but to utter two syllables proclaims him at once a native of the land of shamrocks and potatoes <PERSON>Mrs Gale</PERSON> hates Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> more than either of the other two but she fears him also for he is a tall strongly built personage with real Irish legs and arms and a face as genuinely national not the Milesian face not <PERSON>Daniel O Connell</PERSON> s style but the high featured North American Indian sort of visage which belongs to a certain class of the Irish gentry and has a petrified and proud look better suited to the owner of an estate of slaves than to the landlord of a free peasantry Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s father termed himself a gentleman he was poor and in debt and besottedly arrogant and his son was like him <PERSON>Mrs Gale</PERSON> offered the loaf Cut it woman said her guest and the woman cut it accordingly Had she followed her inclinations she would have cut the parson also her <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> soul revolted absolutely from his manner of command The curates had good appetites and though the beef was tough they ate a great deal of it They swallowed too a tolerable allowance of the flat beer while a dish of <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> pudding and two tureens of vegetables disappeared like leaves before locusts The cheese too received distinguished marks of their attention and a spice cake which followed by way of dessert vanished like a vision and was no more found Its elegy was chanted in the kitchen by <PERSON>Abraham Mrs Gale</PERSON> s son and heir a youth of six summers he had reckoned upon the reversion thereof and when his mother brought down the empty platter he lifted up his voice and wept sore The curates meantime sat and sipped their wine a liquor of unpretending vintage moderately enjoyed Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> indeed would much rather have had whisky but Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> being an Englishman did not keep the beverage While they sipped they argued not on politics nor on philosophy nor on literature these topics were now as ever totally without interest for them not even on theology practical or doctrinal but on minute points of ecclesiastical discipline frivolities which seemed empty as bubbles to all save themselves Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> who contrived to secure two glasses of wine when his brethren contented themselves with one waxed by degrees hilarious after his fashion that is he grew a little insolent said rude things in a hectoring tone and laughed clamorously at his own brilliancy Each of his companions became in turn his butt <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> had a stock of jokes at their service which he was accustomed to serve out regularly on convivial occasions like the present seldom varying his wit for which indeed there was no necessity as he never appeared to consider himself monotonous and did not at all care what others thought Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> he favoured with hints about his extreme meagreness allusions to his turned up nose cutting sarcasms on a certain threadbare chocolate surtout which that gentleman was accustomed to sport whenever it rained or seemed likely to rain and criticisms on a choice set of cockney phrases and modes of pronunciation Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> s own property and certainly deserving of remark for the elegance and finish they communicated to his style Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> was bantered about his stature he was a little man a mere boy in height and breadth compared with the athletic <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> rallied on his musical accomplishments he played the flute and sang hymns like a seraph some young ladies of his parish thought sneered at as the ladies pet teased about his mamma and sisters for whom poor Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> had some lingering regard and of whom he was foolish enough now and then to speak in the presence of the priestly Paddy from whose anatomy the bowels of natural affection had somehow been omitted The victims met these attacks each in his own way Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> with a stilted self complacency and half sullen phlegm the sole props of his otherwise somewhat rickety dignity Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> with the indifference of a light easy disposition which never professed to have any dignity to maintain When <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s raillery became rather too offensive which it soon did they joined in an attempt to turn the tables on him by asking him how many boys had shouted Irish <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> after him as he came along the road that day <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s name was <PERSON>Peter the Rev Peter Augustus Malone</PERSON> requesting to be informed whether it was the mode in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> for clergymen to carry loaded pistols in their pockets and a shillelah in their hands when they made pastoral visits inquiring the signification of such words as vele firrum hellum storrum so Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> invariably pronounced veil firm helm storm and employing such other methods of retaliation as the innate refinement of their minds suggested This of course would not do <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> being neither good natured nor phlegmatic was presently in a towering passion He vociferated gesticulated <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> laughed He reviled them as Saxons and snobs at the very top pitch of his high Celtic voice they taunted him with being the native of a conquered land He menaced rebellion in the name of his counthry vented bitter hatred against English rule they spoke of rags beggary and pestilence The little parlour was in an uproar you would have thought a duel must follow such virulent abuse it seemed a wonder that Mr and <PERSON>Mrs Gale</PERSON> did not take alarm at the noise and send for a constable to keep the peace But they were accustomed to such demonstrations they well knew that the curates never dined or took tea together without a little exercise of the sort and were quite easy as to consequences knowing that these clerical quarrels were as harmless as they were noisy that they resulted in nothing and that on whatever terms the curates might part to night they would be sure to meet the best friends in the world to morrow morning As the worthy pair were sitting by their kitchen fire listening to the repeated and sonorous contact of <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s fist with the mahogany plane of the parlour table and to the consequent start and jingle of decanters and glasses following each assault to the mocking laughter of the allied English disputants and the stuttering declamation of the isolated Hibernian as they thus sat a foot was heard on the outer door step and the knocker quivered to a sharp appeal Mr <PERSON>Gale</PERSON> went and opened Whom have you upstairs in the parlour asked a voice a rather remarkable voice nasal in tone abrupt in utterance O Mr Helstone is it you sir I could hardly see you for the darkness it is so soon dark now Will you walk in sir I want to know first whether it is worth my while walking in Whom have you upstairs The curates sir What all of them Yes sir Been dining here Yes sir That will do With these words a person entered a middle aged man in black He walked straight across the kitchen to an inner door opened it inclined his head forward and stood listening There was something to listen to for the noise above was just then louder than ever Hey he ejaculated to himself then turning to Mr <PERSON>Gale</PERSON> Have you often this sort of work Mr <PERSON>Gale</PERSON> had been a churchwarden and was indulgent to the clergy They re young you know sir they re young said he deprecatingly Young They want caning Bad boys bad boys And if you were a Dissenter <PERSON>John Gale</PERSON> instead of being a good Churchman they d do the like they d expose themselves but I ll By way of finish to this sentence he passed through the inner door drew it after him and mounted the stair Again he listened a few minutes when he arrived at the upper room Making entrance without warning he stood before the curates And they were silent they were transfixed and so was the invader He a personage short of stature but straight of port and bearing on broad shoulders a hawk s head beak and eye the whole surmounted by a Rehoboam or shovel hat which he did not seem to think it necessary to lift or remove before the presence in which he then stood _he_ folded his arms on his chest and surveyed his young friends if friends they were much at his leisure What he began delivering his words in a voice no longer nasal but deep more than deep a voice made purposely hollow and cavernous what has the miracle of <LOCATION>Pentecost</LOCATION> been renewed Have the cloven tongues come down again Where are they The sound filled the whole house just now I heard the seventeen languages in full action Parthians and Medes and Elamites the dwellers in <LOCATION>Mesopotamia</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Judea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cappadocia</LOCATION> in Pontus and <LOCATION>Asia Phrygia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pamphylia</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and in the parts of <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> about <LOCATION>Cyrene</LOCATION> strangers of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> Jews and proselytes Cretes and Arabians every one of these must have had its representative in this room two minutes since I beg your pardon Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> began Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> take a seat pray sir Have a glass of wine His civilities received no answer The falcon in the black coat proceeded What do I talk about the gift of tongues Gift indeed I mistook the chapter and book and Testament gospel for law Acts for Genesis the city of <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> for the plain of Shinar It was no gift but the confusion of tongues which has gabbled me deaf as a post _You_ apostles What you three Certainly not three presumptuous Babylonish masons neither more nor less I assure you sir we were only having a little chat together over a glass of wine after a friendly dinner settling the Dissenters Oh settling the Dissenters were you Was <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> settling the Dissenters It sounded to me much more like settling his co apostles You were quarrelling together making almost as much noise you three alone as <PERSON>Moses Barraclough</PERSON> the preaching tailor and all his hearers are making in the Methodist chapel down yonder where they are in the thick of a revival I know whose fault it is It is yours Malone Mine sir Yours sir <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> were quiet before you came and would be quiet if you were gone I wish when you crossed the Channel you had left your Irish habits behind you <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> student ways won t do here The proceedings which might pass unnoticed in a wild bog and mountain district in <LOCATION>Connaught</LOCATION> will in a decent English parish bring disgrace on those who indulge in them and what is far worse on the sacred institution of which they are merely the humble appendages There was a certain dignity in the little elderly gentleman s manner of rebuking these youths though it was not perhaps quite the dignity most appropriate to the occasion Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> standing straight as a ramrod looking keen as a kite presented despite his clerical hat black coat and gaiters more the air of a veteran officer chiding his subalterns than of a venerable priest exhorting his sons in the faith Gospel mildness apostolic benignity never seemed to have breathed their influence over that keen brown visage but firmness had fixed the features and sagacity had carved her own lines about them I met <PERSON>Supplehough</PERSON> he continued plodding through the mud this wet night going to preach at <LOCATION>Milldean</LOCATION> opposition shop As I told you I heard <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> bellowing in the midst of a conventicle like a possessed bull and I find _you_ gentlemen tarrying over your half pint of muddy port wine and scolding like angry old women No wonder <PERSON>Supplehough</PERSON> should have dipped sixteen adult converts in a day which he did a fortnight since no wonder <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> scamp and hypocrite as he is should attract all the weaver girls in their flowers and ribbons to witness how much harder are his knuckles than the wooden brim of his tub as little wonder that _you_ when you are left to yourselves without your rectors myself and <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> to back you should too often perform the holy service of our church to bare walls and read your bit of a dry discourse to the clerk and the organist and the beadle But enough of the subject I came to see <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> I have an errand unto thee O captain What is it inquired <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> discontentedly There can be no funeral to take at this time of day Have you any arms about you Arms sir yes and legs And he advanced the mighty members Bah weapons I mean I have the pistols you gave me yourself I never part with them I lay them ready cocked on a chair by my bedside at night I have my blackthorn Very good Will you go to Hollow s Mill What is stirring at Hollow s Mill Nothing as yet nor perhaps will be but <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is alone there He has sent all the workmen he can trust to <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> there are only two women left about the place It would be a nice opportunity for any of his well wishers to pay him a visit if they knew how straight the path was made before them I am none of his well wishers sir I don t care for him <PERSON>Soh Malone</PERSON> you are afraid You know me better than that If I really thought there was a chance of a row I would go but <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is a strange shy man whom I never pretend to understand and for the sake of his sweet company only I would not stir a step But there _is_ a chance of a row if a positive riot does not take place of which indeed I see no signs yet it is unlikely this night will pass quite tranquilly You know <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> has resolved to have new machinery and he expects two wagon loads of frames and shears from <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> this evening Scott the overlooker and a few picked men are gone to fetch them They will bring them in safely and quietly enough sir <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> says so and affirms he wants nobody Some one however he must have if it were only to bear evidence in case anything should happen I call him very careless He sits in the counting house with the shutters unclosed he goes out here and there after dark wanders right up the hollow down <LOCATION>Fieldhead Lane</LOCATION> among the plantations just as if he were the darling of the neighbourhood or being as he is its detestation bore a charmed life as they say in tale books He takes no warning from the fate of <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> nor from that of <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> shot one in his own house and the other on the moor But he should take warning sir and use precautions too interposed Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> and I think he would if he heard what I heard the other day What did you hear <PERSON>Davy You</PERSON> know <PERSON>Mike Hartley</PERSON> sir The Antinomian weaver Yes When <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> has been drinking for a few weeks together he generally winds up by a visit to Nunnely vicarage to tell Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> a piece of his mind about his sermons to denounce the horrible tendency of his doctrine of works and warn him that he and all his hearers are sitting in outer darkness Well that has nothing to do with <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Besides being an Antinomian he is a violent Jacobin and leveller sir I know When he is very drunk his mind is always running on regicide <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> is not unacquainted with history and it is rich to hear him going over the list of tyrants of whom as he says the revenger of blood has obtained satisfaction The fellow exults strangely in murder done on crowned heads or on any head for political reasons I have already heard it hinted that he seems to have a queer hankering after <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Is that what you allude to Sweeting You use the proper term sir Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> thinks <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> has no personal hatred of <PERSON>Moore Mike</PERSON> says he even likes to talk to him and run after him but he has a _hankering_ that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> should be made an example of He was extolling him to Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> the other day as the mill owner with the most brains in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> and for that reason he affirms <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> should be chosen as a sacrifice an oblation of a sweet savour Is <PERSON>Mike Hartley</PERSON> in his right mind do you think sir inquired <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> simply Can t tell <PERSON>Davy He</PERSON> may be crazed or he may be only crafty or perhaps a little of both He talks of seeing visions sir Ay He is a very <PERSON>Ezekiel</PERSON> or <PERSON>Daniel</PERSON> for visions He came just when I was going to bed last Friday night to describe one that had been revealed to him in <LOCATION>Nunnely Park</LOCATION> that very afternoon Tell it sir What was it urged <PERSON>Sweeting Davy</PERSON> thou hast an enormous organ of wonder in thy cranium <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> you see has none Neither murders nor visions interest him See what a big vacant <ORGANIZATION>Saph</ORGANIZATION> he looks at this moment <ORGANIZATION>Saph</ORGANIZATION> Who was <ORGANIZATION>Saph</ORGANIZATION> sir I thought you would not know You may find it out It is biblical I know nothing more of him than his name and race but from a boy upwards I have always attached a personality to <ORGANIZATION>Saph</ORGANIZATION> Depend on it he was honest heavy and luckless He met his end at Gob by the hand of Sibbechai But the vision sir <PERSON>Davy</PERSON> thou shalt hear <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> is biting his nails and <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> yawning so I will tell it but to thee <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> is out of work like many others unfortunately Mr Grame Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> s steward gave him a job about the priory According to his account <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> was busy hedging rather late in the afternoon but before dark when he heard what he thought was a band at a distance bugles fifes and the sound of a trumpet it came from the forest and he wondered that there should be music there He looked up All amongst the trees he saw moving objects red like poppies or white like may blossom The wood was full of them they poured out and filled the park He then perceived they were soldiers thousands and tens of thousands but they made no more noise than a swarm of midges on a summer evening They formed in order he affirmed and marched regiment after regiment across the park He followed them to Nunnely Common the music still played soft and distant On the common he watched them go through a number of evolutions A man clothed in scarlet stood in the centre and directed them They extended he declared over fifty acres They were in sight half an hour then they marched away quite silently The whole time he heard neither voice nor tread nothing but the faint music playing a solemn march Where did they go sir Towards <PERSON>Briarfield Mike</PERSON> followed them They seemed passing <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> when a column of smoke such as might be vomited by a park of artillery spread noiseless over the fields the road the common and rolled he said blue and dim to his very feet As it cleared away he looked again for the soldiers but they were vanished he saw them no more <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> like a wise <PERSON>Daniel</PERSON> as he is not only rehearsed the vision but gave the interpretation thereof It signifies he intimated bloodshed and civil conflict Do you credit it sir asked Sweeting Do you Davy But come <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> why are you not off I am rather surprised sir you did not stay with <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> yourself You like this kind of thing So I should have done had I not unfortunately happened to engage <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> to sup with me on his way home from the Bible Society meeting at Nunnely I promised to send you as my substitute for which by the bye he did not thank me He would much rather have had me than you <PERSON>Peter Should</PERSON> there be any real need of help I shall join you The mill bell will give warning Meantime go unless turning suddenly to <PERSON>Messrs Sweeting</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> unless <PERSON>Davy Sweeting</PERSON> or <PERSON>Joseph Donne</PERSON> prefers going What do you say gentlemen The commission is an honourable one not without the seasoning of a little real peril for the country is in a queer state as you all know and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and his mill and his machinery are held in sufficient odium There are chivalric sentiments there is high beating courage under those waistcoats of yours I doubt not Perhaps I am too partial to my favourite <PERSON>Peter Little David</PERSON> shall be the champion or spotless <PERSON>Joseph Malone</PERSON> you are but a great floundering <PERSON>Saul</PERSON> after all good only to lend your armour Out with your firearms fetch your shillelah It is there in the corner With a significant grin <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> produced his pistols offering one to each of his brethren They were not readily seized on With graceful modesty each gentleman retired a step from the presented weapon I never touch them I never did touch anything of the kind said Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> I am almost a stranger to Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> murmured <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> If you never touched a pistol try the feel of it now great satrap of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> As to the little minstrel he probably prefers encountering the <LOCATION>Philistines</LOCATION> with no other weapon than his flute Get their hats Peter They ll both of em go No sir no Mr Helstone My mother wouldn t like it pleaded Sweeting And I make it a rule never to get mixed up in affairs of the kind observed <PERSON>Donne Helstone</PERSON> smiled sardonically <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> laughed a horse laugh He then replaced his arms took his hat and cudgel and saying that he never felt more in tune for a shindy in his life and that he wished a score of greasy cloth dressers might beat up <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s quarters that night he made his exit clearing the stairs at a stride or two and making the house shake with the bang of the front door behind him CHAPTER II THE WAGONS The evening was pitch dark star and moon were quenched in gray rain clouds gray they would have been by day by night they looked sable <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> was not a man given to close observation of nature her changes passed for the most part unnoticed by him He could walk miles on the most varying April day and never see the beautiful dallying of earth and heaven never mark when a sunbeam kissed the hill tops making them smile clear in green light or when a shower wept over them hiding their crests with the low hanging dishevelled tresses of a cloud He did not therefore care to contrast the sky as it now appeared a muffled streaming vault all black save where towards the east the furnaces of <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> ironworks threw a tremulous lurid shimmer on the horizon with the same sky on an unclouded frosty night He did not trouble himself to ask where the constellations and the planets were gone or to regret the black blue serenity of the air ocean which those white islets stud and which another ocean of heavier and denser element now rolled below and concealed He just doggedly pursued his way leaning a little forward as he walked and wearing his hat on the back of his head as his Irish manner was Tramp tramp he went along the causeway where the road boasted the privilege of such an accommodation splash splash through the mire filled cart ruts where the flags were exchanged for soft mud He looked but for certain landmarks the spire of <ORGANIZATION>Briarfield Church</ORGANIZATION> farther on the lights of Redhouse This was an inn and when he reached it the glow of a fire through a half curtained window a vision of glasses on a round table and of revellers on an oaken settle had nearly drawn aside the curate from his course He thought longingly of a tumbler of whisky and water In a strange place he would instantly have realized the dream but the company assembled in that kitchen were Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s own parishioners they all knew him He sighed and passed on The highroad was now to be quitted as the remaining distance to Hollow s Mill might be considerably reduced by a short cut across fields These fields were level and monotonous <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> took a direct course through them jumping hedge and wall He passed but one building here and that seemed large and hall like though irregular You could see a high gable then a long front then a low gable then a thick lofty stack of chimneys There were some trees behind it It was dark not a candle shone from any window It was absolutely still the rain running from the eaves and the rather wild but very low whistle of the wind round the chimneys and through the boughs were the sole sounds in its neighbourhood This building passed the fields hitherto flat declined in a rapid descent Evidently a vale lay below through which you could hear the water run One light glimmered in the depth For that beacon <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> steered He came to a little white house you could see it was white even through this dense darkness and knocked at the door A fresh faced servant opened it By the candle she held was revealed a narrow passage terminating in a narrow stair Two doors covered with crimson baize a strip of crimson carpet down the steps contrasted with light coloured walls and white floor made the little interior look clean and fresh Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is at home I suppose Yes sir but he is not in Not in Where is he then At the mill in the counting house Here one of the crimson doors opened Are the wagons come <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> asked a female voice and a female head at the same time was apparent It might not be the head of a goddess indeed a screw of curl paper on each side the temples quite forbade that supposition but neither was it the head of a <ORGANIZATION>Gorgon</ORGANIZATION> yet <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> seemed to take it in the latter light Big as he was he shrank bashfully back into the rain at the view thereof and saying I ll go to him hurried in seeming trepidation down a short lane across an obscure yard towards a huge black mill The work hours were over the hands were gone The machinery was at rest the mill shut up <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> walked round it Somewhere in its great sooty flank he found another chink of light he knocked at another door using for the purpose the thick end of his shillelah with which he beat a rousing tattoo A key turned the door unclosed Is it <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> What news of the wagons Joe No it s myself Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> would send me Oh Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> The voice in uttering this name had the slightest possible cadence of disappointment After a moment s pause it continued politely but a little formally I beg you will come in Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> I regret extremely Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> should have thought it necessary to trouble you so far There was no necessity I told him so and on such a night but walk forwards Through a dark apartment of aspect undistinguishable <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> followed the speaker into a light and bright room within very light and bright indeed it seemed to eyes which for the last hour had been striving to penetrate the double darkness of night and fog but except for its excellent fire and for a lamp of elegant design and vivid lustre burning on a table it was a very plain place The boarded floor was carpetless the three or four stiff backed green painted chairs seemed once to have furnished the kitchen of some farm house a desk of strong solid formation the table aforesaid and some framed sheets on the stone coloured walls bearing plans for building for gardening designs of machinery etc completed the furniture of the place Plain as it was it seemed to satisfy <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> who when he had removed and hung up his wet surtout and hat drew one of the rheumatic looking chairs to the hearth and set his knees almost within the bars of the red grate Comfortable quarters you have here Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and all snug to yourself Yes but my sister would be glad to see you if you would prefer stepping into the house Oh no The ladies are best alone I never was a lady s man You don t mistake me for my friend <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> do you Mr <PERSON>Moore Sweeting Which</PERSON> of them is that The gentleman in the chocolate overcoat or the little gentleman The little one he of Nunnely the cavalier of the Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> with the whole six of whom he is in love ha ha Better be generally in love with all than specially with one I should think in that quarter But he is specially in love with one besides for when I and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> urged him to make a choice amongst the fair bevy he named which do you think With a queer quiet smile Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> replied <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> of course or Harriet Ha ha you ve an excellent guess But what made you hit on those two Because they are the tallest the handsomest and <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> at least is the stoutest and as your friend Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> is but a little slight figure I concluded that according to a frequent rule in such cases he preferred his contrast You are right <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> it is But he has no chance has he Moore What has Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> besides his curacy This question seemed to tickle <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> amazingly He laughed for full three minutes before he answered it What has Sweeting Why <PERSON>David</PERSON> has his harp or flute which comes to the same thing He has a sort of pinchbeck watch ditto ring ditto eyeglass That s what he has How would he propose to keep Miss <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> in gowns only Ha ha Excellent I ll ask him that next time I see him I ll roast him for his presumption But no doubt he expects old <PERSON>Christopher Sykes</PERSON> would do something handsome He is rich is he not They live in a large house <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> carries on an extensive concern Therefore he must be wealthy eh Therefore he must have plenty to do with his wealth and in these times would be about as likely to think of drawing money from the business to give dowries to his daughters as I should be to dream of pulling down the cottage there and constructing on its ruins a house as large as Fieldhead Do you know what I heard <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> the other day No Perhaps that I _was_ about to effect some such change Your Briarfield gossips are capable of saying that or sillier things That you were going to take <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> on a lease I thought it looked a dismal place by the bye to night as I passed it and that it was your intention to settle a Miss <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> there as mistress to be married in short ha ha Now which is it <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> I am sure You said she was the handsomest I wonder how often it has been settled that I was to be married since I came to Briarfield They have assigned me every marriageable single woman by turns in the district Now it was the two Misses <PERSON>Wynns</PERSON> first the dark then the light one now the red haired Miss <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> then the mature <PERSON>Ann Pearson</PERSON> At present you throw on my shoulders all the tribe of the Misses Sykes On what grounds this gossip rests God knows I visit nowhere I seek female society about as assiduously as you do Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> If ever I go to <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> it is only to give <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> or <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> a call in their counting house where our discussions run on other topics than matrimony and our thoughts are occupied with other things than courtships establishments dowries The cloth we can t sell the hands we can t employ the mills we can t run the perverse course of events generally which we cannot alter fill our hearts I take it pretty well at present to the tolerably complete exclusion of such figments as love making etc I go along with you completely <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> If there is one notion I hate more than another it is that of marriage I mean marriage in the vulgar weak sense as a mere matter of sentiment two beggarly fools agreeing to unite their indigence by some fantastic tie of feeling Humbug But an advantageous connection such as can be formed in consonance with dignity of views and permanency of solid interests is not so bad eh No responded <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> in an absent manner The subject seemed to have no interest for him he did not pursue it After sitting for some time gazing at the fire with a preoccupied air he suddenly turned his head <PERSON>Hark</PERSON> said he Did you hear wheels Rising he went to the window opened it and listened He soon closed it It is only the sound of the wind rising he remarked and the rivulet a little swollen rushing down the hollow I expected those wagons at six it is near nine now Seriously do you suppose that the putting up of this new machinery will bring you into danger inquired <PERSON>Malone Helstone</PERSON> seems to think it will I only wish the machines the frames were safe here and lodged within the walls of this mill Once put up I defy the frame breakers Let them only pay me a visit and take the consequences My mill is my castle One despises such low scoundrels observed <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> in a profound vein of reflection I almost wish a party would call upon you to night but the road seemed extremely quiet as I came along I saw nothing astir You came by the Redhouse Yes There would be nothing on that road It is in the direction of Stilbro the risk lies And you think there is risk What these fellows have done to others they may do to me There is only this difference most of the manufacturers seem paralyzed when they are attacked <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> for instance when his dressing shop was set on fire and burned to the ground when the cloth was torn from his tenters and left in shreds in the field took no steps to discover or punish the miscreants he gave up as tamely as a rabbit under the jaws of a ferret Now I if I know myself should stand by my trade my mill and my machinery <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> says these three are your gods that the Orders in Council are with you another name for the seven deadly sins that <PERSON>Castlereagh</PERSON> is your <PERSON>Antichrist</PERSON> and the war party his legions Yes I abhor all these things because they ruin me They stand in my way I cannot get on I cannot execute my plans because of them I see myself baffled at every turn by their untoward effects But you are rich and thriving <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I am very rich in cloth I cannot sell You should step into my warehouse yonder and observe how it is piled to the roof with pieces Roakes and <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> are in the same condition <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> used to be their market but the <ORGANIZATION>Orders in Council</ORGANIZATION> have cut that off <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> did not seem prepared to carry on briskly a conversation of this sort He began to knock the heels of his boots together and to yawn And then to think continued Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> who seemed too much taken up with the current of his own thoughts to note the symptoms of his guest s _ennui_ to think that these ridiculous gossips of <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> will keep pestering one about being married As if there was nothing to be done in life but to pay attention as they say to some young lady and then to go to church with her and then to start on a bridal tour and then to run through a round of visits and then I suppose to be having a family Oh que le diable emporte He broke off the aspiration into which he was launching with a certain energy and added more calmly I believe women talk and think only of these things and they naturally fancy men s minds similarly occupied Of course of course assented <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> but never mind them And he whistled looked impatiently round and seemed to feel a great want of something This time <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> caught and it appeared comprehended his demonstrations Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> said he you must require refreshment after your wet walk I forget hospitality Not at all rejoined <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> but he looked as if the right nail was at last hit on the head nevertheless <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> rose and opened a cupboard It is my fancy said he to have every convenience within myself and not to be dependent on the feminity in the cottage yonder for every mouthful I eat or every drop I drink I often spend the evening and sup here alone and sleep with <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> in the mill Sometimes I am my own watchman I require little sleep and it pleases me on a fine night to wander for an hour or two with my musket about the hollow Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> can you cook a mutton chop Try me I ve done it hundreds of times at college There s a dishful then and there s the gridiron Turn them quickly You know the secret of keeping the juices in Never fear me you shall see Hand a knife and fork please The curate turned up his coat cuffs and applied himself to the cookery with vigour The manufacturer placed on the table plates a loaf of bread a black bottle and two tumblers He then produced a small copper kettle still from the same well stored recess his cupboard filled it with water from a large stone jar in a corner set it on the fire beside the hissing gridiron got lemons sugar and a small china punch bowl but while he was brewing the punch a tap at the door called him away Is it you <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> Yes sir Will you come to supper please sir No I shall not be in to night I shall sleep in the mill So lock the doors and tell your mistress to go to bed He returned You have your household in proper order observed <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> approvingly as with his fine face ruddy as the embers over which he bent he assiduously turned the mutton chops You are not under petticoat government like poor <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> a man whew how the fat spits it has burnt my hand destined to be ruled by women Now you and I <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> there s a fine brown one for you and full of gravy you and I will have no gray mares in our stables when we marry I don t know I never think about it If the gray mare is handsome and tractable why not The chops are done Is the punch brewed There is a glassful Taste it When <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> and his minions return they shall have a share of this provided they bring home the frames intact <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> waxed very exultant over the supper He laughed aloud at trifles made bad jokes and applauded them himself and in short grew unmeaningly noisy His host on the contrary remained quiet as before It is time reader that you should have some idea of the appearance of this same host I must endeavour to sketch him as he sits at table He is what you would probably call at first view rather a strange looking man for he is thin dark sallow very foreign of aspect with shadowy hair carelessly streaking his forehead It appears that he spends but little time at his toilet or he would arrange it with more taste He seems unconscious that his features are fine that they have a southern symmetry clearness regularity in their chiselling nor does a spectator become aware of this advantage till he has examined him well for an anxious countenance and a hollow somewhat haggard outline of face disturb the idea of beauty with one of care His eyes are large and grave and gray their expression is intent and meditative rather searching than soft rather thoughtful than genial When he parts his lips in a smile his physiognomy is agreeable not that it is frank or cheerful even then but you feel the influence of a certain sedate charm suggestive whether truly or delusively of a considerate perhaps a kind nature of feelings that may wear well at home patient forbearing possibly faithful feelings He is still young not more than thirty his stature is tall his figure slender His manner of speaking displeases He has an outlandish accent which notwithstanding a studied carelessness of pronunciation and diction grates on a British and especially on a <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> ear Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> indeed was but half a Briton and scarcely that He came of a foreign ancestry by the mother s side and was himself born and partly reared on a foreign soil A hybrid in nature it is probable he had a hybrid s feeling on many points patriotism for one it is likely that he was unapt to attach himself to parties to sects even to climes and customs it is not impossible that he had a tendency to isolate his individual person from any community amidst which his lot might temporarily happen to be thrown and that he felt it to be his best wisdom to push the interests of <PERSON>Robert G rard Moore</PERSON> to the exclusion of philanthropic consideration for general interests with which he regarded the said <PERSON>G rard Moore</PERSON> as in a great measure disconnected Trade was Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s hereditary calling the G rards of <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> had been merchants for two centuries back Once they had been wealthy merchants but the uncertainties the involvements of business had come upon them disastrous speculations had loosened by degrees the foundations of their credit The house had stood on a tottering base for a dozen years and at last in the shock of the French Revolution it had rushed down a total ruin In its fall was involved the English and <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> firm of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> closely connected with the <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> house and of which one of the partners resident in <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> had married <PERSON>Hortense G</PERSON> rard with the prospect of his bride inheriting her father <PERSON>Constantine G</PERSON> rard s share in the business She inherited as we have seen but his share in the liabilities of the firm and these liabilities though duly set aside by a composition with creditors some said her son <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> accepted in his turn as a legacy and that he aspired one day to discharge them and to rebuild the fallen house of G rard and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> on a scale at least equal to its former greatness It was even supposed that he took by past circumstances much to heart and if a childhood passed at the side of a saturnine mother under foreboding of coming evil and a manhood drenched and blighted by the pitiless descent of the storm could painfully impress the mind _his_ probably was impressed in no golden characters If however he had a great end of restoration in view it was not in his power to employ great means for its attainment He was obliged to be content with the day of small things When he came to <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> he whose ancestors had owned warehouses in this seaport and factories in that inland town had possessed their town house and their country seat saw no way open to him but to rent a cloth mill in an out of the way nook of an out of the way district to take a cottage adjoining it for his residence and to add to his possessions as pasture for his horse and space for his cloth tenters a few acres of the steep rugged land that lined the hollow through which his mill stream brawled All this he held at a somewhat high rent for these war times were hard and everything was dear of the trustees of the Fieldhead estate then the property of a minor At the time this history commences <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> had lived but two years in the district during which period he had at least proved himself possessed of the quality of activity The dingy cottage was converted into a neat tasteful residence Of part of the rough land he had made garden ground which he cultivated with singular even with Flemish exactness and care As to the mill which was an old structure and fitted up with old machinery now become inefficient and out of date he had from the first evinced the strongest contempt for all its arrangements and appointments His aim had been to effect a radical reform which he had executed as fast as his very limited capital would allow and the narrowness of that capital and consequent check on his progress was a restraint which galled his spirit sorely <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> ever wanted to push on Forward was the device stamped upon his soul but poverty curbed him Sometimes figuratively he foamed at the mouth when the reins were drawn very tight In this state of feeling it is not to be expected that he would deliberate much as to whether his advance was or was not prejudicial to others Not being a native nor for any length of time a resident of the neighbourhood he did not sufficiently care when the new inventions threw the old workpeople out of employ He never asked himself where those to whom he no longer paid weekly wages found daily bread and in this negligence he only resembled thousands besides on whom the starving poor of <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> seemed to have a closer claim The period of which I write was an overshadowed one in British history and especially in the history of the northern provinces War was then at its height <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was all involved therein <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> if not weary was worn with long resistance yes and half her people were weary too and cried out for peace on any terms National honour was become a mere empty name of no value in the eyes of many because their sight was dim with famine and for a morsel of meat they would have sold their birthright The Orders in Council provoked by <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> s <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> decrees and forbidding neutral powers to trade with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had by offending <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> cut off the principal market of the <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> woollen trade and brought it consequently to the verge of ruin Minor foreign markets were glutted and would receive no more The Brazils <LOCATION>Portugal Sicily</LOCATION> were all overstocked by nearly two years consumption At this crisis certain inventions in machinery were introduced into the staple manufactures of the north which greatly reducing the number of hands necessary to be employed threw thousands out of work and left them without legitimate means of sustaining life A bad harvest supervened Distress reached its climax Endurance overgoaded stretched the hand of fraternity to sedition The throes of a sort of moral earthquake were felt heaving under the hills of the northern counties But as is usual in such cases nobody took much notice When a food riot broke out in a manufacturing town when a gig mill was burnt to the ground or a manufacturer s house was attacked the furniture thrown into the streets and the family forced to flee for their lives some local measures were or were not taken by the local magistracy A ringleader was detected or more frequently suffered to elude detection newspaper paragraphs were written on the subject and there the thing stopped As to the sufferers whose sole inheritance was labour and who had lost that inheritance who could not get work and consequently could not get wages and consequently could not get bread they were left to suffer on perhaps inevitably left It would not do to stop the progress of invention to damage science by discouraging its improvements the war could not be terminated efficient relief could not be raised There was no help then so the unemployed underwent their destiny ate the bread and drank the waters of affliction Misery generates hate These sufferers hated the machines which they believed took their bread from them they hated the buildings which contained those machines they hated the manufacturers who owned those buildings In the parish of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> with which we have at present to do Hollow s Mill was the place held most abominable G rard <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> in his double character of semi foreigner and thorough going progressist the man most abominated And it perhaps rather agreed with <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s temperament than otherwise to be generally hated especially when he believed the thing for which he was hated a right and an expedient thing and it was with a sense of warlike excitement he on this night sat in his counting house waiting the arrival of his frame laden wagons <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s coming and company were it may be most unwelcome to him He would have preferred sitting alone for he liked a silent sombre unsafe solitude His watchman s musket would have been company enough for him the full flowing beck in the den would have delivered continuously the discourse most genial to his ear With the queerest look in the world had the manufacturer for some ten minutes been watching the Irish curate as the latter made free with the punch when suddenly that steady gray eye changed as if another vision came between it and <PERSON>Malone Moore</PERSON> raised his hand <PERSON>Chut</PERSON> he said in his French fashion as <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> made a noise with his glass He listened a moment then rose put his hat on and went out at the counting house door The night was still dark and stagnant the water yet rushed on full and fast its flow almost seemed a flood in the utter silence <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s ear however caught another sound very distant but yet dissimilar broken and rugged in short a sound of heavy wheels crunching a stony road He returned to the counting house and lit a lantern with which he walked down the mill yard and proceeded to open the gates The big wagons were coming on the dray horses huge hoofs were heard splashing in the mud and water <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> hailed them Hey <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> Is all right Probably <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> was yet at too great a distance to hear the inquiry He did not answer it Is all right I say again asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> when the elephant like leader s nose almost touched his Some one jumped out from the foremost wagon into the road a voice cried aloud Ay ay divil all s raight We ve smashed em And there was a run The wagons stood still they were now deserted <PERSON>Joe Scott No Joe Scott</PERSON> answered <ORGANIZATION>Murgatroyd Pighills Sykes No</ORGANIZATION> reply Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> lifted his lantern and looked into the vehicles There was neither man nor machinery they were empty and abandoned Now <PERSON>Mr Moore</PERSON> loved his machinery He had risked the last of his capital on the purchase of these frames and shears which to night had been expected Speculations most important to his interests depended on the results to be wrought by them Where were they The words we ve smashed em rang in his ears How did the catastrophe affect him By the light of the lantern he held were his features visible relaxing to a singular smile the smile the man of determined spirit wears when he reaches a juncture in his life where this determined spirit is to feel a demand on its strength when the strain is to be made and the faculty must bear or break Yet he remained silent and even motionless for at the instant he neither knew what to say nor what to do He placed the lantern on the ground and stood with his arms folded gazing down and reflecting An impatient trampling of one of the horses made him presently look up His eye in the moment caught the gleam of something white attached to a part of the harness Examined by the light of the lantern this proved to be a folded paper a billet It bore no address without within was the superscription To the Divil of Hollow s Miln We will not copy the rest of the orthography which was very peculiar but translate it into legible English It ran thus Your hellish machinery is shivered to smash on <PERSON>Stilbro Moor</PERSON> and your men are lying bound hand and foot in a ditch by the roadside Take this as a warning from men that are starving and have starving wives and children to go home to when they have done this deed If you get new machines or if you otherwise go on as you have done you shall hear from us again Beware Hear from you again Yes I ll hear from you again and you shall hear from me I ll speak to you directly On Stilbro Moor you shall hear from me in a moment Having led the wagons within the gates he hastened towards the cottage Opening the door he spoke a few words quickly but quietly to two females who ran to meet him in the passage He calmed the seeming alarm of one by a brief palliative account of what had taken place to the other he said Go into the mill <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> there is the key and ring the mill bell as loud as you can Afterwards you will get another lantern and help me to light up the front Returning to his horses he unharnessed fed and stabled them with equal speed and care pausing occasionally while so occupied as if to listen for the mill bell It clanged out presently with irregular but loud and alarming din The hurried agitated peal seemed more urgent than if the summons had been steadily given by a practised hand On that still night at that unusual hour it was heard a long way round The guests in the kitchen of the Redhouse were startled by the clamour and declaring that there must be summat more nor common to do at Hollow s <PERSON>Miln</PERSON> they called for lanterns and hurried to the spot in a body And scarcely had they thronged into the yard with their gleaming lights when the tramp of horses was heard and a little man in a shovel hat sitting erect on the back of a shaggy pony rode lightly in followed by an aide de camp mounted on a larger steed Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> meantime after stabling his dray horses had saddled his hackney and with the aid of <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> the servant lit up his mill whose wide and long front now glared one great illumination throwing a sufficient light on the yard to obviate all fear of confusion arising from obscurity Already a deep hum of voices became audible Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> had at length issued from the counting house previously taking the precaution to dip his head and face in the stone water jug and this precaution together with the sudden alarm had nearly restored to him the possession of those senses which the punch had partially scattered He stood with his hat on the back of his head and his shillelah grasped in his dexter fist answering much at random the questions of the newly arrived party from the Redhouse Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> now appeared and was immediately confronted by the shovel hat and the shaggy pony Well <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> what is your business with us I thought you would want us to night me and the hetman here patting his pony s neck and <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> and his charger When I heard your mill bell I could sit still no longer so I left <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> to finish his supper alone But where is the enemy I do not see a mask or a smutted face present and there is not a pane of glass broken in your windows Have you had an attack or do you expect one Oh not at all I have neither had one nor expect one answered <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> coolly I only ordered the bell to be rung because I want two or three neighbours to stay here in the Hollow while I and a couple or so more go over to <LOCATION>Stilbro Moor</LOCATION> To Stilbro Moor What to do To meet the wagons The wagons are come home an hour ago Then all s right What more would you have They came home empty and <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> and company are left on the moor and so are the frames Read that scrawl Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> received and perused the document of which the contents have before been given Hum They ve only served you as they serve others But however the poor fellows in the ditch will be expecting help with some impatience This is a wet night for such a berth I and <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> will go with you <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> may stay behind and take care of the mill What is the matter with him His eyes seem starting out of his head He has been eating a mutton chop Indeed <PERSON>Peter Augustus</PERSON> be on your guard Eat no more mutton chops to night You are left here in command of these premises an honourable post Is anybody to stay with me As many of the present assemblage as choose My lads how many of you will remain here and how many will go a little way with me and Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> on the <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> road to meet some men who have been waylaid and assaulted by frame breakers The small number of three volunteered to go the rest preferred staying behind As Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> mounted his horse the rector asked him in a low voice whether he had locked up the mutton chops so that <PERSON>Peter Augustus</PERSON> could not get at them The manufacturer nodded an affirmative and the rescue party set out CHAPTER III <PERSON>MR YORKE</PERSON> Cheerfulness it would appear is a matter which depends fully as much on the state of things within as on the state of things without and around us I make this trite remark because I happen to know that <PERSON>Messrs Helstone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> trotted forth from the mill yard gates at the head of their very small company in the best possible spirits When a ray from a lantern the three pedestrians of the party carried each one fell on Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s face you could see an unusual because a lively spark dancing in his eyes and a new found vivacity mantling on his dark physiognomy and when the rector s visage was illuminated his hard features were revealed all agrin and ashine with glee Yet a drizzling night a somewhat perilous expedition you would think were not circumstances calculated to enliven those exposed to the wet and engaged in the adventure If any member or members of the crew who had been at work on <LOCATION>Stilbro Moor</LOCATION> had caught a view of this party they would have had great pleasure in shooting either of the leaders from behind a wall and the leaders knew this and the fact is being both men of steely nerves and steady beating hearts were elate with the knowledge I am aware reader and you need not remind me that it is a dreadful thing for a parson to be warlike I am aware that he should be a man of peace I have some faint outline of an idea of what a clergyman s mission is amongst mankind and I remember distinctly whose servant he is whose message he delivers whose example he should follow yet with all this if you are a parson hater you need not expect me to go along with you every step of your dismal downward tending unchristian road you need not expect me to join in your deep anathemas at once so narrow and so sweeping in your poisonous rancour so intense and so absurd against the cloth to lift up my eyes and hands with a Supplehough or to inflate my lungs with a <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> in horror and denunciation of the diabolical rector of Briarfield He was not diabolical at all The evil simply was he had missed his vocation He should have been a soldier and circumstances had made him a priest For the rest he was a conscientious hard headed hard handed brave stern implacable faithful little man a man almost without sympathy ungentle prejudiced and rigid but a man true to principle honourable sagacious and sincere It seems to me reader that you cannot always cut out men to fit their profession and that you ought not to curse them because their profession sometimes hangs on them ungracefully Nor will I curse Helstone clerical <PERSON>Cossack</PERSON> as he was Yet he _was_ cursed and by many of his own parishioners as by others he was adored which is the frequent fate of men who show partiality in friendship and bitterness in enmity who are equally attached to principles and adherent to prejudices <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> being both in excellent spirits and united for the present in one cause you would expect that as they rode side by side they would converse amicably Oh no These two men of hard bilious natures both rarely came into contact but they chafed each other s moods Their frequent bone of contention was the war <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was a high Tory there were Tories in those days and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was a bitter Whig a Whig at least as far as opposition to the war party was concerned that being the question which affected his own interest and only on that question did he profess any British politics at all He liked to infuriate <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> by declaring his belief in the invincibility of <PERSON>Bonaparte</PERSON> by taunting <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with the impotence of their efforts to withstand him and by coolly advancing the opinion that it was as well to yield to him soon as late since he must in the end crush every antagonist and reign supreme <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> could not bear these sentiments It was only on the consideration of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> being a sort of outcast and alien and having but half measure of British blood to temper the foreign gall which corroded his veins that he brought himself to listen to them without indulging the wish he felt to cane the speaker Another thing too somewhat allayed his disgust namely a fellow feeling for the dogged tone with which these opinions were asserted and a respect for the consistency of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s crabbed contumacy As the party turned into the <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> road they met what little wind there was the rain dashed in their faces <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had been fretting his companion previously and now braced up by the raw breeze and perhaps irritated by the sharp drizzle he began to goad him Does your Peninsular news please you still he asked What do you mean was the surly demand of the rector I mean have you still faith in that <PERSON>Baal</PERSON> of a Lord <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> And what do you mean now Do you still believe that this wooden faced and pebble hearted idol of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> has power to send fire down from heaven to consume the French holocaust you want to offer up I believe <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> will flog <PERSON>Bonaparte</PERSON> s marshals into the sea the day it pleases him to lift his arm But my dear sir you can t be serious in what you say <PERSON>Bonaparte</PERSON> s marshals are great men who act under the guidance of an omnipotent master spirit Your <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> is the most humdrum of commonplace martinets whose slow mechanical movements are further cramped by an ignorant home government <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> is the soul of <LOCATION>England Wellington</LOCATION> is the right champion of a good cause the fit representative of a powerful a resolute a sensible and an honest nation Your good cause as far as I understand it is simply the restoration of that filthy feeble <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> to a throne which he disgraced Your fit representative of an honest people is a dull witted drover acting for a duller witted farmer and against these are arrayed victorious supremacy and invincible genius Against legitimacy is arrayed usurpation against modest single minded righteous and brave resistance to encroachment is arrayed boastful double tongued selfish and treacherous ambition to possess God defend the right God often defends the powerful What I suppose the handful of Israelites standing dryshod on the <LOCATION>Asiatic</LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION>Red Sea</LOCATION> was more powerful than the host of the Egyptians drawn up on the African side Were they more numerous Were they better appointed Were they more mighty in a word eh <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t speak or you ll tell a lie <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> you know you will They were a poor overwrought band of bondsmen Tyrants had oppressed them through four hundred years a feeble mixture of women and children diluted their thin ranks their masters who roared to follow them through the divided flood were a set of pampered Ethiops about as strong and brutal as the lions of <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> They were armed horsed and charioted the poor Hebrew wanderers were afoot Few of them it is likely had better weapons than their shepherds crooks or their masons building tools their meek and mighty leader himself had only his rod But bethink you <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> right was with them the God of battles was on their side Crime and the lost archangel generalled the ranks of Pharaoh and which triumphed We know that well The Lord saved <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore yea the depths covered them they sank to the bottom as a stone The right hand of the Lord became glorious in power the right hand of the Lord dashed in pieces the enemy You are all right only you forget the true parallel <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> is <PERSON>Moses Europe</PERSON> with her old overgorged empires and rotten dynasties is corrupt <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> gallant <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is the Twelve Tribes and her fresh and vigorous Usurper the Shepherd of Horeb I scorn to answer you <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> accordingly answered himself at least he subjoined to what he had just said an additional observation in a lower voice Oh in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> he was as great as any Moses He was the right thing there fit to head and organize measures for the regeneration of nations It puzzles me to this day how the conqueror of <LOCATION>Lodi</LOCATION> should have condescended to become an emperor a vulgar a stupid humbug and still more how a people who had once called themselves republicans should have sunk again to the grade of mere slaves I despise <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> If <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> had gone as far on the march of civilization as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> did she would hardly have retreated so shamelessly You don t mean to say that besotted imperial <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is any worse than bloody republican <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> demanded <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> fiercely I mean to say nothing but I can think what I please you know Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> both about <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and about revolutions and regicides and restorations in general and about the divine right of kings which you often stickle for in your sermons and the duty of non resistance and the sanity of war and Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s sentence was here cut short by the rapid rolling up of a gig and its sudden stoppage in the middle of the road Both he and the rector had been too much occupied with their discourse to notice its approach till it was close upon them Nah maister did th wagons hit home demanded a voice from the vehicle Can that be <PERSON>Joe Scott Ay ay</PERSON> returned another voice for the gig contained two persons as was seen by the glimmer of its lamp The men with the lanterns had now fallen into the rear or rather the equestrians of the rescue party had outridden the pedestrians Ay Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> it s <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> I m bringing him back to you in a bonny pickle I fand him on the top of the moor yonder him and three others What will you give me for restoring him to you Why my thanks I believe for I could better have afforded to lose a better man That is you I suppose Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> by your voice Ay lad it s me I was coming home from <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> market and just as I got to the middle of the moor and was whipping on as swift as the wind for these they say are not safe times thanks to a bad government I heard a groan I pulled up Some would have whipt on faster but I ve naught to fear that I know of I don t believe there s a lad in these parts would harm me at least I d give them as good as I got if they offered to do it I said Is there aught wrong anywhere Deed is there somebody says speaking out of the ground like What s to do Be sharp and tell me I ordered <PERSON>Nobbut</PERSON> four on us ligging in a ditch says <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> as quiet as could be I telled em more shame to em and bid them get up and move on or I d lend them a lick of the gig whip for my notion was they were all fresh We d ha done that an hour sin but we re teed wi a bit o band says <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> So in a while I got down and loosed em wi my penknife and <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> would ride wi me to tell me all how it happened and t others are coming on as fast as their feet will bring them Well I am greatly obliged to you Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> Are you my lad You know you re not However here are the rest approaching And here by the Lord is another set with lights in their pitchers like the army of <PERSON>Gideon</PERSON> and as we ve th parson wi us good evening Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> we se do Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> returned the salutation of the individual in the gig very stiffly indeed That individual proceeded We re eleven strong men and there s both horses and chariots amang us If we could only fall in wi some of these starved ragamuffins of frame breakers we could win a grand victory We could iv ry one be a <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> that would please ye Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and sich paragraphs as we could contrive for t papers Briarfield suld be famous But we se hev a column and a half i th _<ORGANIZATION>Stilbro Courier</ORGANIZATION>_ ower this job as it is I dare say I se expect no less And I ll promise you no less Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> for I ll write the article myself returned the rector To be sure sartainly And mind ye recommend weel that them at brake t bits o frames and teed <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> s legs wi band suld be hung without benefit o clergy It s a hanging matter or suld be No doubt o that If I judged them I d give them short shrift cried <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> But I mean to let them quite alone this bout to give them rope enough certain that in the end they will hang themselves Let them alone will ye Moore Do you promise that Promise No All I mean to say is I shall give myself no particular trouble to catch them but if one falls in my way You ll snap him up of course Only you would rather they would do something worse than merely stop a wagon before you reckon with them Well we ll say no more on the subject at present Here we are at my door gentlemen and I hope you and the men will step in You will none of you be the worse of a little refreshment <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Helstone</LOCATION> opposed this proposition as unnecessary It was however pressed on them so courteously and the night besides was so inclement and the gleam from the muslin curtained windows of the house before which they had halted looked so inviting that at length they yielded Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> after having alighted from his gig which he left in charge of a man who issued from an outbuilding on his arrival led the way in It will have been remarked that Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> varied a little in his phraseology Now he spoke broad <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> and anon he expressed himself in very pure English His manner seemed liable to equal alternations He could be polite and affable and he could be blunt and rough His station then you could not easily determine by his speech and demeanour Perhaps the appearance of his residence may decide it The men he recommended to take the kitchen way saying that he would see them served wi summat to taste presently The gentlemen were ushered in at the front entrance They found themselves in a matted hall lined almost to the ceiling with pictures Through this they were conducted to a large parlour with a magnificent fire in the grate the most cheerful of rooms it appeared as a whole and when you came to examine details the enlivening effect was not diminished There was no splendour but there was taste everywhere unusual taste the taste you would have said of a travelled man a scholar and a gentleman A series of Italian views decked the walls Each of these was a specimen of true art A connoisseur had selected them they were genuine and valuable Even by candle light the bright clear skies the soft distances with blue air quivering between the eye and the hills the fresh tints and well massed lights and shadows charmed the view The subjects were all pastoral the scenes were all sunny There was a guitar and some music on a sofa there were cameos beautiful miniatures a set of Grecian looking vases on the mantelpiece there were books well arranged in two elegant bookcases Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> bade his guests be seated He then rang for wine To the servant who brought it he gave hospitable orders for the refreshment of the men in the kitchen The rector remained standing he seemed not to like his quarters he would not touch the wine his host offered him E en as you will remarked Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> I reckon you re thinking of Eastern customs Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and you ll not eat nor drink under my roof feared we suld be forced to be friends but I am not so particular or superstitious You might sup the contents of that decanter and you might give me a bottle of the best in your own cellar and I d hold myself free to oppose you at every turn still in every vestry meeting and justice meeting where we encountered one another It is just what I should expect of you Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> Does it agree wi ye now Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> to be riding out after rioters of a wet night at your age It always agrees with me to be doing my duty and in this case my duty is a thorough pleasure To hunt down vermin is a noble occupation fit for an archbishop Fit for ye at ony rate But where s t curate He s happen gone to visit some poor body in a sick gird or he s happen hunting down vermin in another direction He is doing garrison duty at Hollow s Mill You left him a sup o wine I hope <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> turning to Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to keep his courage up He did not pause for an answer but continued quickly still addressing <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> who had thrown himself into an old fashioned chair by the fireside Move it <PERSON>Robert Get</PERSON> up my lad That place is mine Take the sofa or three other chairs if you will but not this It belangs to me and nob dy else Why are you so particular to that chair Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> lazily vacating the place in obedience to orders My father war afore me and that s all t answer I sall gie thee and it s as good a reason as Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> can give for the main feck o his notions <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> are you ready to go inquired the rector <PERSON>Nay Robert</PERSON> s not ready or rather I m not ready to part wi him He s an ill lad and wants correcting Why sir What have I done Made thyself enemies on every hand What do I care for that What difference does it make to me whether your <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> louts hate me or like me Ay there it is The lad is a mak of an alien amang us His father would never have talked i that way Go back to <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> where you were born and bred mauvaise t te Mauvaise t te vous m me je ne fais que mon devoir quant vos lourdauds de paysans je m en moque En ravanche mon gar on nos lourdauds de paysans se moqueront de toi sois en certain replied <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> speaking with nearly as pure a French accent as G rard <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> C est bon c est bon Et puisque cela m est gal que mes amis ne s en inqui tent pas Tes amis O sont ils tes amis Je fais cho o sont ils et je suis fort aise que l cho seul y r pond Au diable les amis Je me souviens encore du moment o mon p re et mes oncles G rard appell rent autour d eux leurs amis et Dieu sait si les amis se sont empress s d accourir leur secours Tenez M <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> ce mot ami m irrite trop ne m en parlez plus Comme tu voudras And here Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> held his peace and while he sits leaning back in his three cornered carved oak chair I will snatch my opportunity to sketch the portrait of this French speaking <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> gentleman CHAPTER IV <PERSON>MR YORKE</PERSON> _continued_ A <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> gentleman he was _par excellence_ in every point about fifty five years old but looking at first sight still older for his hair was silver white His forehead was broad not high his face fresh and hale the harshness of the north was seen in his features as it was heard in his voice every trait was thoroughly English not a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line anywhere it was an inelegant unclassic unaristocratic mould of visage Fine people would perhaps have called it vulgar sensible people would have termed it characteristic shrewd people would have delighted in it for the pith sagacity intelligence the rude yet real originality marked in every lineament latent in every furrow But it was an indocile a scornful and a sarcastic face the face of a man difficult to lead and impossible to drive His stature was rather tall and he was well made and wiry and had a stately integrity of port there was not a suspicion of the clown about him anywhere I did not find it easy to sketch Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s person but it is more difficult to indicate his mind If you expect to be treated to a Perfection reader or even to a benevolent philanthropic old gentleman in him you are mistaken He has spoken with some sense and with some good feeling to Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> but you are not thence to conclude that he always spoke and thought justly and kindly Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> in the first place was without the organ of veneration a great want and which throws a man wrong on every point where veneration is required Secondly he was without the organ of comparison a deficiency which strips a man of sympathy and thirdly he had too little of the organs of benevolence and ideality which took the glory and softness from his nature and for him diminished those divine qualities throughout the universe The want of veneration made him intolerant to those above him kings and nobles and priests dynasties and parliaments and establishments with all their doings most of their enactments their forms their rights their claims were to him an abomination all rubbish he found no use or pleasure in them and believed it would be clear gain and no damage to the world if its high places were razed and their occupants crushed in the fall The want of veneration too made him dead at heart to the electric delight of admiring what is admirable it dried up a thousand pure sources of enjoyment it withered a thousand vivid pleasures He was not irreligious though a member of no sect but his religion could not be that of one who knows how to venerate He believed in God and heaven but his God and heaven were those of a man in whom awe imagination and tenderness lack The weakness of his powers of comparison made him inconsistent while he professed some excellent general doctrines of mutual toleration and forbearance he cherished towards certain classes a bigoted antipathy He spoke of parsons and all who belonged to parsons of lords and the appendages of lords with a harshness sometimes an insolence as unjust as it was insufferable He could not place himself in the position of those he vituperated he could not compare their errors with their temptations their defects with their disadvantages he could not realize the effect of such and such circumstances on himself similarly situated and he would often express the most ferocious and tyrannical wishes regarding those who had acted as he thought ferociously and tyrannically To judge by his threats he would have employed arbitrary even cruel means to advance the cause of freedom and equality Equality yes Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> talked about equality but at heart he was a proud man very friendly to his workpeople very good to all who were beneath him and submitted quietly to be beneath him but haughty as <PERSON>Beelzebub</PERSON> to whomsoever the world deemed for he deemed no man his superior Revolt was in his blood he could not bear control his father his grandfather before him could not bear it and his children after him never could The want of general benevolence made him very impatient of imbecility and of all faults which grated on his strong shrewd nature it left no check to his cutting sarcasm As he was not merciful he would sometimes wound and wound again without noticing how much he hurt or caring how deep he thrust As to the paucity of ideality in his mind that can scarcely be called a fault a fine ear for music a correct eye for colour and form left him the quality of taste and who cares for imagination Who does not think it a rather dangerous senseless attribute akin to weakness perhaps partaking of frenzy a disease rather than a gift of the mind Probably all think it so but those who possess or fancy they possess it To hear them speak you would believe that their hearts would be cold if that elixir did not flow about them that their eyes would be dim if that flame did not refine their vision that they would be lonely if this strange companion abandoned them You would suppose that it imparted some glad hope to spring some fine charm to summer some tranquil joy to autumn some consolation to winter which you do not feel An illusion of course but the fanatics cling to their dream and would not give it for gold As Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> did not possess poetic imagination himself he considered it a most superfluous quality in others Painters and musicians he could tolerate and even encourage because he could relish the results of their art he could see the charm of a fine picture and feel the pleasure of good music but a quiet poet whatever force struggled whatever fire glowed in his breast if he could not have played the man in the counting house of the tradesman in the <LOCATION>Piece Hall</LOCATION> might have lived despised and died scorned under the eyes of <PERSON>Hiram Yorke</PERSON> And as there are many <PERSON>Hiram Yorkes</PERSON> in the world it is well that the true poet quiet externally though he may be has often a truculent spirit under his placidity and is full of shrewdness in his meekness and can measure the whole stature of those who look down on him and correctly ascertain the weight and value of the pursuits they disdain him for not having followed It is happy that he can have his own bliss his own society with his great friend and goddess Nature quite independent of those who find little pleasure in him and in whom he finds no pleasure at all It is just that while the world and circumstances often turn a dark cold side to him and properly too because he first turns a dark cold careless side to them he should be able to maintain a festal brightness and cherishing glow in his bosom which makes all bright and genial for him while strangers perhaps deem his existence a Polar winter never gladdened by a sun The true poet is not one whit to be pitied and he is apt to laugh in his sleeve when any misguided sympathizer whines over his wrongs Even when utilitarians sit in judgment on him and pronounce him and his art useless he hears the sentence with such a hard derision such a broad deep comprehensive and merciless contempt of the unhappy Pharisees who pronounce it that he is rather to be chidden than condoled with These however are not Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s reflections and it is with Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> we have at present to do I have told you some of his faults reader as to his good points he was one of the most honourable and capable men in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> even those who disliked him were forced to respect him He was much beloved by the poor because he was thoroughly kind and very fatherly to them To his workmen he was considerate and cordial When he dismissed them from an occupation he would try to set them on to something else or if that was impossible help them to remove with their families to a district where work might possibly be had It must also be remarked that if as sometimes chanced any individual amongst his hands showed signs of insubordination <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> who like many who abhor being controlled knew how to control with vigour had the secret of crushing rebellion in the germ of eradicating it like a bad weed so that it never spread or developed within the sphere of his authority Such being the happy state of his own affairs he felt himself at liberty to speak with the utmost severity of those who were differently situated to ascribe whatever was unpleasant in their position entirely to their own fault to sever himself from the masters and advocate freely the cause of the operatives Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s family was the first and oldest in the district and he though not the wealthiest was one of the most influential men His education had been good In his youth before the French Revolution he had travelled on the Continent He was an adept in the French and Italian languages During a two years sojourn in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> he had collected many good paintings and tasteful rarities with which his residence was now adorned His manners when he liked were those of a finished gentleman of the old school his conversation when he was disposed to please was singularly interesting and original and if he usually expressed himself in the <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> dialect it was because he chose to do so preferring his native Doric to a more refined vocabulary A <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> burr he affirmed was as much better than a cockney s lisp as a bull s bellow than a raton s squeak Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> knew every one and was known by every one for miles round yet his intimate acquaintances were very few Himself thoroughly original he had no taste for what was ordinary a racy rough character high or low ever found acceptance with him a refined insipid personage however exalted in station was his aversion He would spend an hour any time in talking freely with a shrewd workman of his own or with some queer sagacious old woman amongst his cottagers when he would have grudged a moment to a commonplace fine gentleman or to the most fashionable and elegant if frivolous lady His preferences on these points he carried to an extreme forgetting that there may be amiable and even admirable characters amongst those who cannot be original Yet he made exceptions to his own rule There was a certain order of mind plain ingenuous neglecting refinement almost devoid of intellectuality and quite incapable of appreciating what was intellectual in him but which at the same time never felt disgust at his rudeness was not easily wounded by his sarcasm did not closely analyze his sayings doings or opinions with which he was peculiarly at ease and consequently which he peculiarly preferred He was lord amongst such characters They while submitting implicitly to his influence never acknowledged because they never reflected on his superiority they were quite tractable therefore without running the smallest danger of being servile and their unthinking easy artless insensibility was as acceptable because as convenient to Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> as that of the chair he sat on or of the floor he trod It will have been observed that he was not quite uncordial with Mr <PERSON>Moore He</PERSON> had two or three reasons for entertaining a faint partiality to that gentleman It may sound odd but the first of these was that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> spoke English with a foreign and French with a perfectly pure accent and that his dark thin face with its fine though rather wasted lines had a most anti British and anti <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> look These points seem frivolous unlikely to influence a character like <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s but the fact is they recalled old perhaps pleasurable associations they brought back his travelling his youthful days He had seen amidst Italian cities and scenes faces like <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s he had heard in Parisian caf s and theatres voices like his He was young then and when he looked at and listened to the alien he seemed young again Secondly he had known <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s father and had had dealings with him That was a more substantial though by no means a more agreeable tie for as his firm had been connected with <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s in business it had also in some measure been implicated in its losses Thirdly he had found <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself a sharp man of business He saw reason to anticipate that he would in the end by one means or another make money and he respected both his resolution and acuteness perhaps also his hardness A fourth circumstance which drew them together was that of Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> being one of the guardians of the minor on whose estate Hollow s Mill was situated consequently <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> in the course of his alterations and improvements had frequent occasion to consult him As to the other guest now present in Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s parlour Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> between him and his host there existed a double antipathy the antipathy of nature and that of circumstances The free thinker hated the formalist the lover of liberty detested the disciplinarian Besides it was said that in former years they had been rival suitors of the same lady Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> as a general rule was when young noted for his preference of sprightly and dashing women a showy shape and air a lively wit a ready tongue chiefly seemed to attract him He never however proposed to any of these brilliant belles whose society he sought and all at once he seriously fell in love with and eagerly wooed a girl who presented a complete contrast to those he had hitherto noticed a girl with the face of a <PERSON>Madonna</PERSON> a girl of living marble stillness personified No matter that when he spoke to her she only answered him in monosyllables no matter that his sighs seemed unheard that his glances were unreturned that she never responded to his opinions rarely smiled at his jests paid him no respect and no attention no matter that she seemed the opposite of everything feminine he had ever in his whole life been known to admire For him <PERSON>Mary Cave</PERSON> was perfect because somehow for some reason no doubt he had a reason he loved her Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> at that time curate of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> loved <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> too or at any rate he fancied her Several others admired her for she was beautiful as a monumental angel but the clergyman was preferred for his office s sake that office probably investing him with some of the illusion necessary to allure to the commission of matrimony and which <LOCATION>Miss Cave</LOCATION> did not find in any of the young wool staplers her other adorers Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> neither had nor professed to have Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s absorbing passion for her He had none of the humble reverence which seemed to subdue most of her suitors he saw her more as she really was than the rest did He was consequently more master of her and himself She accepted him at the first offer and they were married Nature never intended Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> to make a very good husband especially to a quiet wife He thought so long as a woman was silent nothing ailed her and she wanted nothing If she did not complain of solitude solitude however continued could not be irksome to her If she did not talk and put herself forward express a partiality for this an aversion to that she had no partialities or aversions and it was useless to consult her tastes He made no pretence of comprehending women or comparing them with men They were a different probably a very inferior order of existence A wife could not be her husband s companion much less his confidante much less his stay _His_ wife after a year or two was of no great importance to him in any shape and when she one day as he thought suddenly for he had scarcely noticed her decline but as others thought gradually took her leave of him and of life and there was only a still beautiful featured mould of clay left cold and white in the conjugal couch he felt his bereavement who shall say how little Yet perhaps more than he seemed to feel it for he was not a man from whom grief easily wrung tears His dry eyed and sober mourning scandalized an old housekeeper and likewise a female attendant who had waited upon Mrs Helstone in her sickness and who perhaps had had opportunities of learning more of the deceased lady s nature of her capacity for feeling and loving than her husband knew They gossiped together over the corpse related anecdotes with embellishments of her lingering decline and its real or supposed cause In short they worked each other up to some indignation against the austere little man who sat examining papers in an adjoining room unconscious of what opprobrium he was the object <PERSON>Mrs Helstone</PERSON> was hardly under the sod when rumours began to be rife in the neighbourhood that she had died of a broken heart These magnified quickly into reports of hard usage and finally details of harsh treatment on the part of her husband reports grossly untrue but not the less eagerly received on that account Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> heard them partly believed them Already of course he had no friendly feeling to his successful rival Though himself a married man now and united to a woman who seemed a complete contrast to <PERSON>Mary Cave</PERSON> in all respects he could not forget the great disappointment of his life and when he heard that what would have been so precious to him had been neglected perhaps abused by another he conceived for that other a rooted and bitter animosity Of the nature and strength of this animosity Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was but half aware He neither knew how much <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> had loved <PERSON>Mary Cave</PERSON> what he had felt on losing her nor was he conscious of the calumnies concerning his treatment of her familiar to every ear in the neighbourhood but his own He believed political and religious differences alone separated him and Mr <PERSON>Yorke Had</PERSON> he known how the case really stood he would hardly have been induced by any persuasion to cross his former rival s threshold Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> did not resume his lecture of <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> The conversation ere long recommenced in a more general form though still in a somewhat disputative tone The unquiet state of the country the various depredations lately committed on mill property in the district supplied abundant matter for disagreement especially as each of the three gentlemen present differed more or less in his views on these subjects Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> thought the masters aggrieved the workpeople unreasonable he condemned sweepingly the widespread spirit of disaffection against constituted authorities the growing indisposition to bear with patience evils he regarded as inevitable The cures he prescribed were vigorous government interference strict magisterial vigilance when necessary prompt military coercion Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> wished to know whether this interference vigilance and coercion would feed those who were hungry give work to those who wanted work and whom no man would hire He scouted the idea of inevitable evils He said public patience was a camel on whose back the last atom that could be borne had already been laid and that resistance was now a duty the widespread spirit of disaffection against constituted authorities he regarded as the most promising sign of the times the masters he allowed were truly aggrieved but their main grievances had been heaped on them by a corrupt base and bloody government these were Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s epithets Madmen like <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> demons like Castlereagh mischievous idiots like <PERSON>Perceval</PERSON> were the tyrants the curses of the country the destroyers of her trade It was their infatuated perseverance in an unjustifiable a hopeless a ruinous war which had brought the nation to its present pass It was their monstrously oppressive taxation it was the infamous Orders in Council the originators of which deserved impeachment and the scaffold if ever public men did that hung a millstone about <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> s neck But where was the use of talking he demanded What chance was there of reason being heard in a land that was king ridden priest ridden peer ridden where a lunatic was the nominal monarch an unprincipled debauchee the real ruler where such an insult to common sense as hereditary legislators was tolerated where such a humbug as a bench of bishops such an arrogant abuse as a pampered persecuting established church was endured and venerated where a standing army was maintained and a host of lazy parsons and their pauper families were kept on the fat of the land Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> rising up and putting on his shovel hat observed in reply that in the course of his life he had met with two or three instances where sentiments of this sort had been very bravely maintained so long as health strength and worldly prosperity had been the allies of him who professed them but there came a time he said to all men when the keepers of the house should tremble when they should be afraid of that which is high and fear should be in the way and that time was the test of the advocate of anarchy and rebellion the enemy of religion and order Ere now he affirmed he had been called upon to read those prayers our church has provided for the sick by the miserable dying bed of one of her most rancorous foes he had seen such a one stricken with remorse solicitous to discover a place for repentance and unable to find any though he sought it carefully with tears He must forewarn Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> that blasphemy against God and the king was a deadly sin and that there was such a thing as judgment to come Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> believed fully that there was such a thing as judgment to come If it were otherwise it would be difficult to imagine how all the scoundrels who seemed triumphant in this world who broke innocent hearts with impunity abused unmerited privileges were a scandal to honourable callings took the bread out of the mouths of the poor browbeat the humble and truckled meanly to the rich and proud were to be properly paid off in such coin as they had earned But he added whenever he got low spirited about such like goings on and their seeming success in this mucky lump of a planet he just reached down t owd book pointing to a great Bible in the bookcase opened it like at a chance and he was sure to light of a verse blazing wi a blue brimstone low that set all straight He knew he said where some folk war bound for just as weel as if an angel wi great white wings had come in ower t door stone and told him Sir said <PERSON>Mr Helstone</PERSON> collecting all his dignity sir the great knowledge of man is to know himself and the bourne whither his own steps tend Ay ay You ll recollect Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> that Ignorance was carried away from the very gates of heaven borne through the air and thrust in at a door in the side of the hill which led down to hell Nor have I forgotten Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> that Vain Confidence not seeing the way before him fell into a deep pit which was on purpose there made by the prince of the grounds to catch vainglorious fools withal and was dashed to pieces with his fall Now interposed Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> who had hitherto sat a silent but amused spectator of this worldly combat and whose indifference to the party politics of the day as well as to the gossip of the neighbourhood made him an impartial if apathetic judge of the merits of such an encounter you have both sufficiently blackballed each other and proved how cordially you detest each other and how wicked you think each other For my part my hate is still running in such a strong current against the fellows who have broken my frames that I have none to spare for my private acquaintance and still less for such a vague thing as a sect or a government But really gentlemen you both seem very bad by your own showing worse than ever I suspected you to be I dare not stay all night with a rebel and blasphemer like you <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and I hardly dare ride home with a cruel and tyrannical ecclesiastic like Mr Helstone I am going however Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said the rector sternly Come with me or not as you please Nay he shall not have the choice he _shall_ go with you responded <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> It s midnight and past and I ll have nob dy staying up i my house any longer <PERSON>Ye mun</PERSON> all go He rang the bell <PERSON>Deb</PERSON> said he to the servant who answered it clear them folk out o t kitchen and lock t doors and be off to bed Here is your way gentlemen he continued to his guests and lighting them through the passage he fairly put them out at his front door They met their party hurrying out pell mell by the back way Their horses stood at the gate they mounted and rode off <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> laughing at their abrupt dismissal Helstone deeply indignant thereat CHAPTER V HOLLOW S COTTAGE <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s good spirits were still with him when he rose next morning He and <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> had both spent the night in the mill availing themselves of certain sleeping accommodations producible from recesses in the front and back counting houses The master always an early riser was up somewhat sooner even than usual He awoke his man by singing a French song as he made his toilet <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> re not custen dahn then maister cried <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> Not a stiver mon gar on which means my lad Get up and we ll take a turn through the mill before the hands come in and I ll explain my future plans We ll have the machinery yet <PERSON>Joseph You</PERSON> never heard of <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> perhaps And th arrand spider Yes but I hev I ve read th history o <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> and happen knaw as mich on t as ye and I understand ye to mean to say ye ll persevere I do Is there mony o your mak i your country inquired <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> as he folded up his temporary bed and put it away In my country Which is my country Why <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> isn t it Not it indeed The circumstance of the French having seized <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> where I was born does not make me a Frenchman <PERSON>Holland</PERSON> then I am not a Dutchman Now you are confounding <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> Flanders I scorn the insinuation <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I a Flamand Have I a Flemish face the clumsy nose standing out the mean forehead falling back the pale blue eyes fleur de t te Am I all body and no legs like a Flamand But you don t know what they are like those Netherlanders <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I m an Anversois My mother was an <PERSON>Anversoise</PERSON> though she came of French lineage which is the reason I speak French But your father war <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> which maks ye a bit <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> too and onybody may see ye re akin to us ye re so keen o making brass and getting forrards <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> you re an impudent dog but I ve always been accustomed to a boorish sort of insolence from my youth up The classe ouvri re that is the working people in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> bear themselves brutally towards their employers and by _brutally_ <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I mean _brutalement_ which perhaps when properly translated should be _roughly_ We allus speak our minds i this country and them young parsons and grand folk fro <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> is shocked at wer incivility and we like weel enough to gi e em summat to be shocked at cause it s sport to us to watch em turn up the whites o their een and spreed out their bits o hands like as they re flayed wi bogards and then to hear em say nipping off their words short like Dear dear Whet seveges How very corse You _are_ savages <PERSON>Joe You</PERSON> don t suppose you re civilized do you Middling middling maister I reckon at us manufacturing lads i th north is a deal more intelligent and knaws a deal more nor th farming folk i th south Trade sharpens wer wits and them that s mechanics like me is forced to think <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> know what wi looking after machinery and sich like I ve getten into that way that when I see an effect I look straight out for a cause and I oft lig hold on t to purpose and then I like reading and I m curious to knaw what them that reckons to govern us aims to do for us and wi us And there s many cuter nor me there s many a one amang them greasy chaps at smells o oil and amang them dyers wi blue and black skins that has a long head and that can tell what a fooil of a law is as well as ye or old <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and a deal better nor soft uns like <PERSON>Christopher Sykes</PERSON> o Whinbury and greet hectoring nowts like yond Irish <PERSON>Peter Helstone</PERSON> s curate You think yourself a clever fellow I know <PERSON>Scott Ay</PERSON> I m fairish I can tell cheese fro chalk and I m varry weel aware that I ve improved sich opportunities as I have had a deal better nor some at reckons to be aboon me but there s thousands i <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> that s as good as me and a two three that s better You re a great man you re a sublime fellow but you re a prig a conceited noodle with it all <PERSON>Joe You</PERSON> need not to think that because you ve picked up a little knowledge of practical mathematics and because you have found some scantling of the elements of chemistry at the bottom of a dyeing vat that therefore you re a neglected man of science and you need not to suppose that because the course of trade does not always run smooth and you and such as you are sometimes short of work and of bread that therefore your class are martyrs and that the whole form of government under which you live is wrong And moreover you need not for a moment to insinuate that the virtues have taken refuge in cottages and wholly abandoned slated houses Let me tell you I particularly abominate that sort of trash because I know so well that human nature is human nature everywhere whether under tile or thatch and that in every specimen of human nature that breathes vice and virtue are ever found blended in smaller or greater proportions and that the proportion is not determined by station I have seen villains who were rich and I have seen villains who were poor and I have seen villains who were neither rich nor poor but who had realized <PERSON>Agar</PERSON> s wish and lived in fair and modest competency The clock is going to strike six Away with you <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> and ring the mill bell It was now the middle of the month of February by six o clock therefore dawn was just beginning to steal on night to penetrate with a pale ray its brown obscurity and give a demi translucence to its opaque shadows Pale enough that ray was on this particular morning no colour tinged the east no flush warmed it To see what a heavy lid day slowly lifted what a wan glance she flung along the hills you would have thought the sun s fire quenched in last night s floods The breath of this morning was chill as its aspect a raw wind stirred the mass of night cloud and showed as it slowly rose leaving a colourless silver gleaming ring all round the horizon not blue sky but a stratum of paler vapour beyond It had ceased to rain but the earth was sodden and the pools and rivulets were full The mill windows were alight the bell still rung loud and now the little children came running in in too great a hurry let us hope to feel very much nipped by the inclement air and indeed by contrast perhaps the morning appeared rather favourable to them than otherwise for they had often come to their work that winter through snow storms through heavy rain through hard frost Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> stood at the entrance to watch them pass He counted them as they went by To those who came rather late he said a word of reprimand which was a little more sharply repeated by <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> when the lingerers reached the work rooms Neither master nor overlooker spoke savagely They were not savage men either of them though it appeared both were rigid for they fined a delinquent who came considerably too late Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> made him pay his penny down ere he entered and informed him that the next repetition of the fault would cost him twopence Rules no doubt are necessary in such cases and coarse and cruel masters will make coarse and cruel rules which at the time we treat of at least they used sometimes to enforce tyrannically but though I describe imperfect characters every character in this book will be found to be more or less imperfect my pen refusing to draw anything in the model line I have not undertaken to handle degraded or utterly infamous ones Child torturers slave masters and drivers I consign to the hands of jailers The novelist may be excused from sullying his page with the record of their deeds Instead then of harrowing up my reader s soul and delighting his organ of wonder with effective descriptions of stripes and scourgings I am happy to be able to inform him that neither Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> nor his overlooker ever struck a child in their mill <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> had indeed once very severely flogged a son of his own for telling a lie and persisting in it but like his employer he was too phlegmatic too calm as well as too reasonable a man to make corporal chastisement other than the exception to his treatment of the young Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> haunted his mill his mill yard his dye house and his warehouse till the sickly dawn strengthened into day The sun even rose at least a white disc clear tintless and almost chill looking as ice peeped over the dark crest of a hill changed to silver the livid edge of the cloud above it and looked solemnly down the whole length of the den or narrow dale to whose strait bounds we are at present limited It was eight o clock the mill lights were all extinguished the signal was given for breakfast the children released for half an hour from toil betook themselves to the little tin cans which held their coffee and to the small baskets which contained their allowance of bread Let us hope they have enough to eat it would be a pity were it otherwise And now at last Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> quitted the mill yard and bent his steps to his dwelling house It was only a short distance from the factory but the hedge and high bank on each side of the lane which conducted to it seemed to give it something of the appearance and feeling of seclusion It was a small whitewashed place with a green porch over the door scanty brown stalks showed in the garden soil near this porch and likewise beneath the windows stalks budless and flowerless now but giving dim prediction of trained and blooming creepers for summer days A grass plat and borders fronted the cottage The borders presented only black mould yet except where in sheltered nooks the first shoots of snowdrop or crocus peeped green as emerald from the earth The spring was late it had been a severe and prolonged winter the last deep snow had but just disappeared before yesterday s rains on the hills indeed white remnants of it yet gleamed flecking the hollows and crowning the peaks the lawn was not verdant but bleached as was the grass on the bank and under the hedge in the lane Three trees gracefully grouped rose beside the cottage They were not lofty but having no rivals near they looked well and imposing where they grew Such was Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s home a snug nest for content and contemplation but one within which the wings of action and ambition could not long lie folded Its air of modest comfort seemed to possess no particular attraction for its owner Instead of entering the house at once he fetched a spade from a little shed and began to work in the garden For about a quarter of an hour he dug on uninterrupted At length however a window opened and a female voice called to him Eh bien Tu ne d je nes pas ce matin The answer and the rest of the conversation was in French but as this is an English book I shall translate it into English Is breakfast ready Hortense Certainly it has been ready half an hour Then I am ready too I have a canine hunger He threw down his spade and entered the house The narrow passage conducted him to a small parlour where a breakfast of coffee and bread and butter with the somewhat un English accompaniment of stewed pears was spread on the table Over these viands presided the lady who had spoken from the window I must describe her before I go any farther She seemed a little older than Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> perhaps she was thirty five tall and proportionately stout she had very black hair for the present twisted up in curl papers a high colour in her cheeks a small nose a pair of little black eyes The lower part of her face was large in proportion to the upper her forehead was small and rather corrugated she had a fretful though not an ill natured expression of countenance there was something in her whole appearance one felt inclined to be half provoked with and half amused at The strangest point was her dress a stuff petticoat and a striped cotton camisole The petticoat was short displaying well a pair of feet and ankles which left much to be desired in the article of symmetry You will think I have depicted a remarkable slattern reader Not at all <PERSON>Hortense Moore</PERSON> she was Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s sister was a very orderly economical person The petticoat camisole and curl papers were her morning costume in which of forenoons she had always been accustomed to go her household ways in her own country She did not choose to adopt English fashions because she was obliged to live in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> she adhered to her old Belgian modes quite satisfied that there was a merit in so doing <PERSON>Mademoiselle</PERSON> had an excellent opinion of herself an opinion not wholly undeserved for she possessed some good and sterling qualities but she rather over estimated the kind and degree of these qualities and quite left out of the account sundry little defects which accompanied them You could never have persuaded her that she was a prejudiced and narrow minded person that she was too susceptible on the subject of her own dignity and importance and too apt to take offence about trifles yet all this was true However where her claims to distinction were not opposed and where her prejudices were not offended she could be kind and friendly enough To her two brothers for there was another <PERSON>G rard Moore</PERSON> besides <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> she was very much attached As the sole remaining representatives of their decayed family the persons of both were almost sacred in her eyes Of <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> however she knew less than of <PERSON>Robert He</PERSON> had been sent to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> when a mere boy and had received his education at an English school His education not being such as to adapt him for trade perhaps too his natural bent not inclining him to mercantile pursuits he had when the blight of hereditary prospects rendered it necessary for him to push his own fortune adopted the very arduous and very modest career of a teacher He had been usher in a school and was said now to be tutor in a private family <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> when she mentioned <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> described him as having what she called des moyens but as being too backward and quiet Her praise of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was in a different strain less qualified she was very proud of him she regarded him as the greatest man in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> all he said and did was remarkable in her eyes and she expected others to behold him from the same point of view nothing could be more irrational monstrous and infamous than opposition from any quarter to <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> unless it were opposition to herself Accordingly as soon as the said <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was seated at the breakfast table and she had helped him to a portion of stewed pears and cut him a good sized Belgian tartine she began to pour out a flood of amazement and horror at the transaction of last night the destruction of the frames <ORGANIZATION>Quelle</ORGANIZATION> id e to destroy them <ORGANIZATION>Quelle</ORGANIZATION> action honteuse On voyait bien que les ouvriers de ce pays taient la fois betes et m chants C tait absolument comme les domestiques anglais les servantes surtout rien d insupportable comme cette <PERSON>Sara</PERSON> par exemple She looks clean and industrious Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> remarked Looks I don t know how she looks and I do not say that she is altogether dirty or idle mais elle est d une insolence She disputed with me a quarter of an hour yesterday about the cooking of the beef she said I boiled it to rags that English people would never be able to eat such a dish as our bouilli that the bouillon was no better than greasy warm water and as to the choucroute she affirms she cannot touch it That barrel we have in the cellar delightfully prepared by my own hands she termed a tub of hog wash which means food for pigs I am harassed with the girl and yet I cannot part with her lest I should get a worse You are in the same position with your workmen pauvre cher fr re I am afraid you are not very happy in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> Hortense It is my duty to be happy where you are brother but otherwise there are certainly a thousand things which make me regret our native town All the world here appears to me ill bred mal lev I find my habits considered ridiculous If a girl out of your mill chances to come into the kitchen and find me in my jupon and camisole preparing dinner for you know I cannot trust <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> to cook a single dish she sneers If I accept an invitation out to tea which I have done once or twice I perceive I am put quite into the background I have not that attention paid me which decidedly is my due Of what an excellent family are the G rards as we know and the <PERSON>Moores</PERSON> also They have a right to claim a certain respect and to feel wounded when it is withheld from them In <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> I was always treated with distinction here one would think that when I open my lips in company I speak English with a ridiculous accent whereas I am quite assured that I pronounce it perfectly <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> we were known rich in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> we were never known but poor Precisely and thus mercenary are mankind Again dear brother last Sunday if you recollect was very wet accordingly I went to church in my neat black sabots objects one would not indeed wear in a fashionable city but which in the country I have ever been accustomed to use for walking in dirty roads Believe me as I paced up the aisle composed and tranquil as I am always four ladies and as many gentlemen laughed and hid their faces behind their prayer books Well well don t put on the sabots again I told you before I thought they were not quite the thing for this country But brother they are not common sabots such as the peasantry wear I tell you they are sabots noirs tr s propres tr s convenables At <LOCATION>Mons</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Leuze</LOCATION> cities not very far removed from the elegant capital of <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> it is very seldom that the respectable people wear anything else for walking in winter Let any one try to wade the mud of the Flemish chauss es in a pair of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> brodequins on m en dirait des nouvelles Never mind <LOCATION>Mons</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Leuze</PERSON> and the Flemish chauss es do at <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> as the Romans do And as to the camisole and jupon I am not quite sure about them either I never see an English lady dressed in such garments Ask <PERSON>Caroline Helstone Caroline</PERSON> _I_ ask <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> _I_ consult her about my dress It is _she_ who on all points should consult _me_ She is a child She is eighteen or at least seventeen old enough to know all about gowns petticoats and chaussures Do not spoil <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I entreat you brother Do not make her of more consequence than she ought to be At present she is modest and unassuming let us keep her so With all my heart Is she coming this morning She will come at ten as usual to take her French lesson You don t find that she sneers at you do you She does not She appreciates me better than any one else here but then she has more intimate opportunities of knowing me She sees that I have education intelligence manner principles all in short which belongs to a person well born and well bred Are you at all fond of her For _fond_ I cannot say I am not one who is prone to take violent fancies and consequently my friendship is the more to be depended on I have a regard for her as my relative her position also inspires interest and her conduct as my pupil has hitherto been such as rather to enhance than diminish the attachment that springs from other causes She behaves pretty well at lessons To _me_ she behaves very well but you are conscious brother that I have a manner calculated to repel over familiarity to win esteem and to command respect Yet possessed of penetration I perceive clearly that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> is not perfect that there is much to be desired in her Give me a last cup of coffee and while I am drinking it amuse me with an account of her faults Dear brother I am happy to see you eat your breakfast with relish after the fatiguing night you have passed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> then is defective but with my forming hand and almost motherly care she may improve There is about her an occasional something a reserve I think which I do not quite like because it is not sufficiently girlish and submissive and there are glimpses of an unsettled hurry in her nature which put me out Yet she is usually most tranquil too dejected and thoughtful indeed sometimes In time I doubt not I shall make her uniformly sedate and decorous without being unaccountably pensive I ever disapprove what is not intelligible I don t understand your account in the least What do you mean by unsettled hurries for instance An example will perhaps be the most satisfactory explanation I sometimes you are aware make her read French poetry by way of practice in pronunciation She has in the course of her lessons gone through much of <PERSON>Corneille</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Racine</LOCATION> in a very steady sober spirit such as I approve Occasionally she showed indeed a degree of languor in the perusal of those esteemed authors partaking rather of apathy than sobriety and apathy is what I cannot tolerate in those who have the benefit of my instructions besides one should not be apathetic in studying standard works The other day I put into her hands a volume of short fugitive pieces I sent her to the window to learn one by heart and when I looked up I saw her turning the leaves over impatiently and curling her lip absolutely with scorn as she surveyed the little poems cursorily I chid her Ma cousine said she tout cela m ennuie la mort I told her this was improper language <PERSON>Dieu</PERSON> she exclaimed il n y a donc pas deux lignes de po sie dans toute la litt rature fran aise I inquired what she meant She begged my pardon with proper submission <PERSON>Ere</PERSON> long she was still I saw her smiling to herself over the book She began to learn assiduously In half an hour she came and stood before me presented the volume folded her hands as I always require her to do and commenced the repetition of that short thing by Ch nier La Jeune Captive If you had heard the manner in which she went through this and in which she uttered a few incoherent comments when she had done you would have known what I meant by the phrase unsettled hurry One would have thought Ch nier was more moving than all <LOCATION>Racine</LOCATION> and all <PERSON>Corneille You</PERSON> brother who have so much sagacity will discern that this disproportionate preference argues an ill regulated mind but she is fortunate in her preceptress I will give her a system a method of thought a set of opinions I will give her the perfect control and guidance of her feelings Be sure you do Hortense Here she comes That was her shadow passed the window I believe Ah truly She is too early half an hour before her time My child what brings you here before I have breakfasted This question was addressed to an individual who now entered the room a young girl wrapped in a winter mantle the folds of which were gathered with some grace round an apparently slender figure I came in haste to see how you were <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> and how <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was too I was sure you would be both grieved by what happened last night I did not hear till this morning My uncle told me at breakfast Ah it is unspeakable You sympathize with us Your uncle sympathizes with us My uncle is very angry but he was with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I believe was he not Did he not go with you to Stilbro Moor Yes we set out in very martial style <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> but the prisoners we went to rescue met us half way Of course nobody was hurt Why no only <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> s wrists were a little galled with being pinioned too tightly behind his back You were not there You were not with the wagons when they were attacked No One seldom has the fortune to be present at occurrences at which one would particularly wish to assist Where are you going this morning I saw <PERSON>Murgatroyd</PERSON> saddling your horse in the yard To Whinbury It is market day Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> is going too I met him in his gig Come home with him Why Two are better than one and nobody dislikes Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> at least poor people do not dislike him Therefore he would be a protection to me who am hated Who are _misunderstood_ That probably is the word Shall you be late Will he be late Cousin Hortense It is too probable He has often much business to transact at Whinbury Have you brought your exercise book child Yes What time will you return <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I generally return at seven Do you wish me to be at home earlier Try rather to be back by six It is not absolutely dark at six now but by seven daylight is quite gone And what danger is to be apprehended <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when daylight _is_ gone What peril do you conceive comes as the companion of darkness for me I am not sure that I can define my fears but we all have a certain anxiety at present about our friends My uncle calls these times dangerous He says too that mill owners are unpopular And I am one of the most unpopular Is not that the fact You are reluctant to speak out plainly but at heart you think me liable to <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> s fate who was shot at not indeed from behind a hedge but in his own house through his staircase window as he was going to bed <PERSON>Anne Pearson</PERSON> showed me the bullet in the chamber door remarked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> gravely as she folded her mantle and arranged it and her muff on a side table You know she continued there is a hedge all the way along the road from here to <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> and there are the Fieldhead plantations to pass but you will be back by six or before Certainly he will affirmed <PERSON>Hortense And</PERSON> now my child prepare your lessons for repetition while I put the peas to soak for the pur e at dinner With this direction she left the room You suspect I have many enemies then <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> said Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and doubtless you know me to be destitute of friends Not destitute <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> There is your sister your brother <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> whom I have never seen there is Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and there is my uncle besides of course many more <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> smiled You would be puzzled to name your many more said he But show me your exercise book What extreme pains you take with the writing My sister I suppose exacts this care She wants to form you in all things after the model of a Flemish school girl What life are you destined for <PERSON>Caroline What</PERSON> will you do with your French drawing and other accomplishments when they are acquired You may well say when they are acquired for as you are aware till <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> began to teach me I knew precious little As to the life I am destined for I cannot tell I suppose to keep my uncle s house till She hesitated Till what Till he dies No How harsh to say that I never think of his dying He is only fifty five But till in short till events offer other occupations for me A remarkably vague prospect Are you content with it I used to be formerly Children you know have little reflection or rather their reflections run on ideal themes There are moments _now_ when I am not quite satisfied Why I am making no money earning nothing You come to the point <PERSON>Lina You</PERSON> too then wish to make money I do I should like an occupation and if I were a boy it would not be so difficult to find one I see such an easy pleasant way of learning a business and making my way in life Go on Let us hear what way I could be apprenticed to your trade the cloth trade I could learn it of you as we are distant relations I would do the counting house work keep the books and write the letters while you went to market I know you greatly desire to be rich in order to pay your father s debts perhaps I could help you to get rich Help _me_ You should think of yourself I do think of myself but must one for ever think only of oneself Of whom else do I think Of whom else _dare_ I think The poor ought to have no large sympathies it is their duty to be narrow No Robert Yes Caroline Poverty is necessarily selfish contracted grovelling anxious Now and then a poor man s heart when certain beams and dews visit it may smell like the budding vegetation in yonder garden on this spring day may feel ripe to evolve in foliage perhaps blossom but he must not encourage the pleasant impulse he must invoke Prudence to check it with that frosty breath of hers which is as nipping as any north wind No cottage would be happy then When I speak of poverty I do not so much mean the natural habitual poverty of the working man as the embarrassed penury of the man in debt My grub worm is always a straitened struggling care worn tradesman Cherish hope not anxiety Certain ideas have become too fixed in your mind It may be presumptuous to say it but I have the impression that there is something wrong in your notions of the best means of attaining happiness as there is in Second hesitation I am all ear <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> In courage let me speak the truth in your manner mind I say only _manner_ to these <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> workpeople You have often wanted to tell me that have you not Yes often very often The faults of my manner are I think only negative I am not proud What has a man in my position to be proud of I am only taciturn phlegmatic and joyless As if your living cloth dressers were all machines like your frames and shears In your own house you seem different To those of my own house I am no alien which I am to these English clowns I might act the benevolent with them but acting is not my _forte_ I find them irrational perverse they hinder me when I long to hurry forward In treating them justly I fulfil my whole duty towards them You don t expect them to love you of course Nor wish it Ah said the monitress shaking her head and heaving a deep sigh With this ejaculation indicative that she perceived a screw to be loose somewhere but that it was out of her reach to set it right she bent over her grammar and sought the rule and exercise for the day I suppose I am not an affectionate man <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> The attachment of a very few suffices me If you please <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> will you mend me a pen or two before you go First let me rule your book for you always contrive to draw the lines aslant There now And now for the pens You like a fine one I think Such as you generally make for me and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> not your own broad points If I were of <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> s calling I might stay at home and dedicate this morning to you and your studies whereas I must spend it in <LOCATION>Skyes</LOCATION> s wool warehouse You will be making money More likely losing it As he finished mending the pens a horse saddled and bridled was brought up to the garden gate There Fred is ready for me I must go I ll take one look to see what the spring has done in the south border too first He quitted the room and went out into the garden ground behind the mill A sweet fringe of young verdure and opening flowers snowdrop crocus even primrose bloomed in the sunshine under the hot wall of the factory <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> plucked here and there a blossom and leaf till he had collected a little bouquet He returned to the parlour pilfered a thread of silk from his sister s work basket tied the flowers and laid them on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s desk Now good morning Thank you <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> It is pretty it looks as it lies there like sparkles of sunshine and blue sky Good morning He went to the door stopped opened his lips as if to speak said nothing and moved on He passed through the wicket and mounted his horse In a second he had flung himself from his saddle again transferred the reins to <PERSON>Murgatroyd</PERSON> and re entered the cottage I forgot my gloves he said appearing to take something from the side table then as an impromptu thought he remarked You have no binding engagement at home perhaps <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I never have Some children s socks which <PERSON>Mrs Ramsden</PERSON> has ordered to knit for the Jew s basket but they will keep Jew s basket be sold Never was utensil better named Anything more Jewish than it its contents and their prices cannot be conceived But I see something a very tiny curl at the corners of your lip which tells me that you know its merits as well as I do Forget the Jew s basket then and spend the day here as a change Your uncle won t break his heart at your absence She smiled No The old Cossack I dare say not muttered <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Then stay and dine with <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> she will be glad of your company I shall return in good time We will have a little reading in the evening The moon rises at half past eight and I will walk up to the rectory with you at nine Do you agree She nodded her head and her eyes lit up <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> lingered yet two minutes He bent over <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s desk and glanced at her grammar he fingered her pen he lifted her bouquet and played with it his horse stamped impatient <PERSON>Fred Murgatroyd</PERSON> hemmed and coughed at the gate as if he wondered what in the world his master was doing Good morning again said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and finally vanished <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> coming in ten minutes after found to her surprise that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had not yet commenced her exercise CHAPTER VI CORIOLANUS <PERSON>Mademoiselle Moore</PERSON> had that morning a somewhat absent minded pupil <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> forgot again and again the explanations which were given to her However she still bore with unclouded mood the chidings her inattention brought upon her Sitting in the sunshine near the window she seemed to receive with its warmth a kind influence which made her both happy and good Thus disposed she looked her best and her best was a pleasing vision To her had not been denied the gift of beauty It was not absolutely necessary to know her in order to like her she was fair enough to please even at the first view Her shape suited her age it was girlish light and pliant every curve was neat every limb proportionate her face was expressive and gentle her eyes were handsome and gifted at times with a winning beam that stole into the heart with a language that spoke softly to the affections Her mouth was very pretty she had a delicate skin and a fine flow of brown hair which she knew how to arrange with taste curls became her and she possessed them in picturesque profusion Her style of dress announced taste in the wearer very unobtrusive in fashion far from costly in material but suitable in colour to the fair complexion with which it contrasted and in make to the slight form which it draped Her present winter garb was of merino the same soft shade of brown as her hair the little collar round her neck lay over a pink ribbon and was fastened with a pink knot She wore no other decoration So much for <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> s appearance As to her character or intellect if she had any they must speak for themselves in due time Her connections are soon explained She was the child of parents separated soon after her birth in consequence of disagreement of disposition Her mother was the half sister of Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s father thus though there was no mixture of blood she was in a distant sense the cousin of <PERSON>Robert Louis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hortense Her</PERSON> father was the brother of Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> a man of the character friends desire not to recall after death has once settled all earthly accounts He had rendered his wife unhappy The reports which were known to be true concerning him had given an air of probability to those which were falsely circulated respecting his better principled brother <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had never known her mother as she was taken from her in infancy and had not since seen her her father died comparatively young and her uncle the rector had for some years been her sole guardian He was not as we are aware much adapted either by nature or habits to have the charge of a young girl He had taken little trouble about her education probably he would have taken none if she finding herself neglected had not grown anxious on her own account and asked every now and then for a little attention and for the means of acquiring such amount of knowledge as could not be dispensed with Still she had a depressing feeling that she was inferior that her attainments were fewer than were usually possessed by girls of her age and station and very glad was she to avail herself of the kind offer made by her cousin <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> soon after the arrival of the latter at Hollow s Mill to teach her French and fine needle work <PERSON>Mdlle Moore</PERSON> for her part delighted in the task because it gave her importance she liked to lord it a little over a docile yet quick pupil She took <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> precisely at her own estimate as an irregularly taught even ignorant girl and when she found that she made rapid and eager progress it was to no talent no application in the scholar she ascribed the improvement but entirely to her own superior method of teaching When she found that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> unskilled in routine had a knowledge of her own desultory but varied the discovery caused her no surprise for she still imagined that from her conversation had the girl unawares gleaned these treasures She thought it even when forced to feel that her pupil knew much on subjects whereof she knew little The idea was not logical but <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> had perfect faith in it <PERSON>Mademoiselle</PERSON> who prided herself on possessing un esprit positif and on entertaining a decided preference for dry studies kept her young cousin to the same as closely as she could She worked her unrelentingly at the grammar of the French language assigning her as the most improving exercise she could devise interminable analyses logiques These analyses were by no means a source of particular pleasure to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> she thought she could have learned French just as well without them and grudged excessively the time spent in pondering over propositions principales et incidents in deciding the incidente determinative and the incidente applicative in examining whether the proposition was pleine elliptique or implicite Sometimes she lost herself in the maze and when so lost she would now and then while <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> was rummaging her drawers upstairs an unaccountable occupation in which she spent a large portion of each day arranging disarranging rearranging and counter arranging carry her book to <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> in the counting house and get the rough place made smooth by his aid Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> possessed a clear tranquil brain of his own Almost as soon as he looked at <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s little difficulties they seemed to dissolve beneath his eye In two minutes he would explain all in two words give the key to the puzzle She thought if <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> could only teach like him how much faster she might learn Repaying him by an admiring and grateful smile rather shed at his feet than lifted to his face she would leave the mill reluctantly to go back to the cottage and then while she completed the exercise or worked out the sum for <PERSON>Mdlle Moore</PERSON> taught her arithmetic too she would wish nature had made her a boy instead of a girl that she might ask <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> to let her be his clerk and sit with him in the counting house instead of sitting with <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> in the parlour Occasionally but this happened very rarely she spent the evening at Hollow s Cottage Sometimes during these visits <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was away attending a market sometimes he was gone to Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s often he was engaged with a male visitor in another room but sometimes too he was at home disengaged free to talk with <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> When this was the case the evening hours passed on wings of light they were gone before they were counted There was no room in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> so pleasant as that small parlour when the three cousins occupied it <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> when she was not teaching or scolding or cooking was far from ill humoured it was her custom to relax towards evening and to be kind to her young English kinswoman There was a means too of rendering her delightful by inducing her to take her guitar and sing and play She then became quite good natured And as she played with skill and had a well toned voice it was not disagreeable to listen to her It would have been absolutely agreeable except that her formal and self important character modulated her strains as it impressed her manners and moulded her countenance Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> released from the business yoke was if not lively himself a willing spectator of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s liveliness a complacent listener to her talk a ready respondent to her questions He was something agreeable to sit near to hover round to address and look at Sometimes he was better than this almost animated quite gentle and friendly The drawback was that by the next morning he was sure to be frozen up again and however much he seemed in his quiet way to enjoy these social evenings he rarely contrived their recurrence This circumstance puzzled the inexperienced head of his cousin If I had a means of happiness at my command she thought I would employ that means often I would keep it bright with use and not let it lie for weeks aside till it gets rusty Yet she was careful not to put in practice her own theory Much as she liked an evening visit to the cottage she never paid one unasked Often indeed when pressed by <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> to come she would refuse because <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> did not second or but slightly seconded the request This morning was the first time he had ever of his own unprompted will given her an invitation and then he had spoken so kindly that in hearing him she had received a sense of happiness sufficient to keep her glad for the whole day The morning passed as usual <PERSON>Mademoiselle</PERSON> ever breathlessly busy spent it in bustling from kitchen to parlour now scolding <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> now looking over <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s exercise or hearing her repetition lesson However faultlessly these tasks were achieved she never commended it was a maxim with her that praise is inconsistent with a teacher s dignity and that blame in more or less unqualified measure is indispensable to it She thought incessant reprimand severe or slight quite necessary to the maintenance of her authority and if no possible error was to be found in the lesson it was the pupil s carriage or air or dress or mien which required correction The usual affray took place about the dinner which meal when <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> at last brought it into the room she almost flung upon the table with a look that expressed quite plainly I never dished such stuff i my life afore it s not fit for dogs Notwithstanding <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> s scorn it was a savoury repast enough The soup was a sort of pur e of dried peas which mademoiselle had prepared amidst bitter lamentations that in this desolate country of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> no haricot beans were to be had Then came a dish of meat nature unknown but supposed to be miscellaneous singularly chopped up with crumbs of bread seasoned uniquely though not unpleasantly and baked in a mould a queer but by no means unpalatable dish Greens oddly bruised formed the accompanying vegetable and a p t of fruit conserved after a recipe devised by <PERSON>Madame G rard Moore</PERSON> s grand m re and from the taste of which it appeared probable that m lasse had been substituted for sugar completed the dinner <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had no objection to this Belgian cookery indeed she rather liked it for a change and it was well she did so for had she evinced any disrelish thereof such manifestation would have injured her in mademoiselle s good graces for ever a positive crime might have been more easily pardoned than a symptom of distaste for the foreign comestibles Soon after dinner <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> coaxed her governess cousin upstairs to dress This man uvre required management To have hinted that the jupon camisole and curl papers were odious objects or indeed other than quite meritorious points would have been a felony Any premature attempt to urge their disappearance was therefore unwise and would be likely to issue in the persevering wear of them during the whole day Carefully avoiding rocks and quicksands however the pupil on pretence of requiring a change of scene contrived to get the teacher aloft and once in the bedroom she persuaded her that it was not worth while returning thither and that she might as well make her toilet now and while mademoiselle delivered a solemn homily on her own surpassing merit in disregarding all frivolities of fashion <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> denuded her of the camisole invested her with a decent gown arranged her collar hair etc and made her quite presentable But <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> would put the finishing touches herself and these finishing touches consisted in a thick handkerchief tied round the throat and a large servant like black apron which spoiled everything On no account would mademoiselle have appeared in her own house without the thick handkerchief and the voluminous apron The first was a positive matter of morality it was quite improper not to wear a fichu the second was the ensign of a good housewife she appeared to think that by means of it she somehow effected a large saving in her brother s income She had with her own hands made and presented to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> similar equipments and the only serious quarrel they had ever had and which still left a soreness in the elder cousin s soul had arisen from the refusal of the younger one to accept of and profit by these elegant presents I wear a high dress and a collar said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and I should feel suffocated with a handkerchief in addition and my short aprons do quite as well as that very long one I would rather make no change Yet <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> by dint of perseverance would probably have compelled her to make a change had not Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> chanced to overhear a dispute on the subject and decided that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s little aprons would suffice and that in his opinion as she was still but a child she might for the present dispense with the fichu especially as her curls were long and almost touched her shoulders There was no appeal against <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s opinion therefore his sister was compelled to yield but she disapproved entirely of the piquant neatness of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s costume and the ladylike grace of her appearance Something more solid and homely she would have considered beaucoup plus convenable The afternoon was devoted to sewing <PERSON>Mademoiselle</PERSON> like most Belgian ladies was specially skilful with her needle She by no means thought it waste of time to devote unnumbered hours to fine embroidery sight destroying lace work marvellous netting and knitting and above all to most elaborate stocking mending She would give a day to the mending of two holes in a stocking any time and think her mission nobly fulfilled when she had accomplished it It was another of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s troubles to be condemned to learn this foreign style of darning which was done stitch by stitch so as exactly to imitate the fabric of the stocking itself a wearifu process but considered by <PERSON>Hortense G</PERSON> rard and by her ancestresses before her for long generations back as one of the first duties of a woman She herself had had a needle cotton and a fearfully torn stocking put into her hand while she yet wore a child s coif on her little black head her hauts faits in the darning line had been exhibited to company ere she was six years old and when she first discovered that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was profoundly ignorant of this most essential of attainments she could have wept with pity over her miserably neglected youth No time did she lose in seeking up a hopeless pair of hose of which the heels were entirely gone and in setting the ignorant English girl to repair the deficiency This task had been commenced two years ago and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had the stockings in her work bag yet She did a few rows every day by way of penance for the expiation of her sins They were a grievous burden to her she would much have liked to put them in the fire and once Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> who had observed her sitting and sighing over them had proposed a private incremation in the counting house but to this proposal <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knew it would have been impolitic to accede the result could only be a fresh pair of hose probably in worse condition She adhered therefore to the ills she knew All the afternoon the two ladies sat and sewed till the eyes and fingers and even the spirits of one of them were weary The sky since dinner had darkened it had begun to rain again to pour fast Secret fears began to steal on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> would be persuaded by Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> or Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> to remain at <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> till it cleared and of that there appeared no present chance Five o clock struck and time stole on still the clouds streamed A sighing wind whispered in the roof trees of the cottage day seemed already closing the parlour fire shed on the clear hearth a glow ruddy as at twilight It will not be fair till the moon rises pronounced <PERSON>Mademoiselle Moore</PERSON> consequently I feel assured that my brother will not return till then Indeed I should be sorry if he did We will have coffee It would be vain to wait for him I am tired May I leave my work now cousin You may since it grows too dark to see to do it well Fold it up put it carefully in your bag then step into the kitchen and desire <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> to bring in the go ter or tea as you call it But it has not yet struck six He may still come He will not I tell you I can calculate his movements I understand my brother Suspense is irksome disappointment bitter All the world has some time or other felt that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> obedient to orders passed into the kitchen <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> was making a dress for herself at the table You are to bring in coffee said the young lady in a spiritless tone and then she leaned her arm and head against the kitchen mantelpiece and hung listlessly over the fire How low you seem miss But it s all because your cousin keeps you so close to work It s a shame Nothing of the kind <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> was the brief reply Oh but I know it is You re fit to cry just this minute for nothing else but because you ve sat still the whole day It would make a kitten dull to be mewed up so <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> does your master often come home early from market when it is wet Never hardly but just to day for some reason he has made a difference What do you mean He is come I am certain I saw <PERSON>Murgatroyd</PERSON> lead his horse into the yard by the back way when I went to get some water at the pump five minutes since He was in the counting house with <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> I believe You are mistaken What should I be mistaken for I know his horse surely But you did not see himself I heard him speak though He was saying something to <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> about having settled all concerning ways and means and that there would be a new set of frames in the mill before another week passed and that this time he would get four soldiers from <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> barracks to guard the wagon <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> are you making a gown Yes Is it a handsome one Beautiful Get the coffee ready I ll finish cutting out that sleeve for you and I ll give you some trimming for it I have some narrow satin ribbon of a colour that will just match it You re very kind miss Be quick there s a good girl But first put your master s shoes on the hearth he will take his boots off when he comes in I hear him he is coming Miss you are cutting the stuff wrong So I am but it is only a snip There is no harm done The kitchen door opened Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> entered very wet and cold <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> half turned from her dressmaking occupation but renewed it for a moment as if to gain a minute s time for some purpose Bent over the dress her face was hidden there was an attempt to settle her features and veil their expression which failed When she at last met Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> her countenance beamed We had ceased to expect you They asserted you would not come she said But I promised to return soon _You_ expected me I suppose No <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I dared not when it rained so fast And you are wet and chilled Change everything If you took cold I should we should blame ourselves in some measure I am not wet through my riding coat is waterproof Dry shoes are all I require There the fire is pleasant after facing the cold wind and rain for a few miles He stood on the kitchen hearth <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> stood beside him Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> while enjoying the genial glow kept his eyes directed towards the glittering brasses on the shelf above Chancing for an instant to look down his glance rested on an uplifted face flushed smiling happy shaded with silky curls lit with fine eyes <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> was gone into the parlour with the tray a lecture from her mistress detained her there <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> placed his hand a moment on his young cousin s shoulder stooped and left a kiss on her forehead Oh said she as if the action had unsealed her lips I was miserable when I thought you would not come I am almost too happy now Are you happy <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Do you like to come home I think I do to night at least Are you certain you are not fretting about your frames and your business and the war Not just now Are you positive you don t feel Hollow s Cottage too small for you and narrow and dismal At this moment no Can you affirm that you are not bitter at heart because rich and great people forget you No more questions You are mistaken if you think I am anxious to curry favour with rich and great people I only want means a position a career Which your own talent and goodness shall win you You were made to be great you _shall_ be great I wonder now if you spoke honestly out of your heart what recipe you would give me for acquiring this same greatness but I know it better than you know it yourself Would it be efficacious Would it work Yes poverty misery bankruptcy Oh life is not what you think it Lina But you are what I think you I am not You are better then Far worse No far better I know you are good How do you know it You look so and I feel you _are_ so Where do you feel it In my heart Ah You judge me with your heart <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> you should judge me with your head I do and then I am quite proud of you <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> you cannot tell all my thoughts about you Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s dark face mustered colour his lips smiled and yet were compressed his eyes laughed and yet he resolutely knit his brow Think meanly of me <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> said he Men in general are a sort of scum very different to anything of which you have an idea I make no pretension to be better than my fellows If you did I should not esteem you so much It is because you are modest that I have such confidence in your merit Are you flattering me he demanded turning sharply upon her and searching her face with an eye of acute penetration No she said softly laughing at his sudden quickness She seemed to think it unnecessary to proffer any eager disavowal of the charge You don t care whether I think you flatter me or not No You are so secure of your own intentions I suppose so What are they Caroline Only to ease my mind by expressing for once part of what I think and then to make you better satisfied with yourself By assuring me that my kinswoman is my sincere friend Just so I am your sincere friend <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> And I am what chance and change shall make me <PERSON>Lina Not</PERSON> my enemy however The answer was cut short by <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> and her mistress entering the kitchen together in some commotion They had been improving the time which Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> had spent in dialogue by a short dispute on the subject of caf au lait which <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> said was the queerest mess she ever saw and a waste of God s good gifts as it was the nature of coffee to be boiled in water and which mademoiselle affirmed to be un breuvage royal a thousand times too good for the mean person who objected to it The former occupants of the kitchen now withdrew into the parlour Before <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> followed them thither <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had only time again to question Not my enemy <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> And <PERSON>Moore Quaker</PERSON> like had replied with another query Could I be And then seating himself at the table had settled <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> at his side <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> scarcely heard mademoiselle s explosion of wrath when she rejoined them the long declamation about the conduite indigne de cette m chante cr ature sounded in her ear as confusedly as the agitated rattling of the china <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> laughed a little at it in very subdued sort and then politely and calmly entreating his sister to be tranquil assured her that if it would yield her any satisfaction she should have her choice of an attendant amongst all the girls in his mill Only he feared they would scarcely suit her as they were most of them he was informed completely ignorant of household work and pert and self willed as <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> was she was perhaps no worse than the majority of the women of her class <PERSON>Mademoiselle</PERSON> admitted the truth of this conjecture according to her ces paysannes anglaises taient tout insupportables What would she not give for some bonne cuisini re anversoise with the high cap short petticoat and decent sabots proper to her class something better indeed than an insolent coquette in a flounced gown and absolutely without cap For <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> it appears did not partake the opinion of <ORGANIZATION>St Paul</ORGANIZATION> that it is a shame for a woman to go with her head uncovered but holding rather a contrary doctrine resolutely refused to imprison in linen or muslin the plentiful tresses of her yellow hair which it was her wont to fasten up smartly with a comb behind and on Sundays to wear curled in front Shall I try and get you an <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> girl asked Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> who stern in public was on the whole very kind in private Merci du cadeau was the answer An <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> girl would not stay here ten days sneered at as she would be by all the young coquines in your factory then softening You are very good dear brother excuse my petulance but truly my domestic trials are severe yet they are probably my destiny for I recollect that our revered mother experienced similar sufferings though she had the choice of all the best servants in <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> Domestics are in all countries a spoiled and unruly set Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had also certain reminiscences about the trials of his revered mother A good mother she had been to him and he honoured her memory but he recollected that she kept a hot kitchen of it in <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> just as his faithful sister did here in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> Thus therefore he let the subject drop and when the coffee service was removed proceeded to console <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> by fetching her music book and guitar and having arranged the ribbon of the instrument round her neck with a quiet fraternal kindness he knew to be all powerful in soothing her most ruffled moods he asked her to give him some of their mother s favourite songs Nothing refines like affection Family jarring vulgarizes family union elevates <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> pleased with her brother and grateful to him looked as she touched her guitar almost graceful almost handsome her everyday fretful look was gone for a moment and was replaced by a sourire plein de bont She sang the songs he asked for with feeling they reminded her of a parent to whom she had been truly attached they reminded her of her young days She observed too that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> listened with na ve interest this augmented her good humour and the exclamation at the close of the song I wish I could sing and play like <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> achieved the business and rendered her charming for the evening It is true a little lecture to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> followed on the vanity of _wishing_ and the duty of _trying_ As <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> it was suggested had not been built in a day so neither had <PERSON>Mademoiselle G rard Moore</PERSON> s education been completed in a week or by merely _wishing_ to be clever It was effort that had accomplished that great work She was ever remarkable for her perseverance for her industry Her masters had remarked that it was as delightful as it was uncommon to find so much talent united with so much solidity and so on Once on the theme of her own merits mademoiselle was fluent Cradled at last in blissful self complacency she took her knitting and sat down tranquil Drawn curtains a clear fire a softly shining lamp gave now to the little parlour its best its evening charm It is probable that the three there present felt this charm They all looked happy What shall we do now <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> asked Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> returning to his seat beside his cousin What shall we do <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> repeated she playfully You decide Not play at chess No Nor draughts nor backgammon No no we both hate silent games that only keep one s hands employed don t we I believe we do Then shall we talk scandal About whom Are we sufficiently interested in anybody to take a pleasure in pulling their character to pieces A question that comes to the point For my part unamiable as it sounds I must say no And I too But it is strange though we want no third fourth I mean she hastily and with contrition glanced at <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> living person among us so selfish we are in our happiness though we don t want to think of the present existing world it would be pleasant to go back to the past to hear people that have slept for generations in graves that are perhaps no longer graves now but gardens and fields speak to us and tell us their thoughts and impart their ideas Who shall be the speaker What language shall he utter French Your French forefathers don t speak so sweetly nor so solemnly nor so impressively as your English ancestors <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> To night you shall be entirely English You shall read an English book An old English book Yes an old English book one that you like and I will choose a part of it that is toned quite in harmony with something in you It shall waken your nature fill your mind with music it shall pass like a skilful hand over your heart and make its strings sound Your heart is a lyre <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> but the lot of your life has not been a minstrel to sweep it and it is often silent Let glorious <PERSON>William</PERSON> come near and touch it You will see how he will draw the English power and melody out of its chords I must read Shakespeare You must have his spirit before you you must hear his voice with your mind s ear you must take some of his soul into yours With a view to making me better Is it to operate like a sermon It is to stir you to give you new sensations It is to make you feel your life strongly not only your virtues but your vicious perverse points Dieu que dit elle cried <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> who hitherto had been counting stitches in her knitting and had not much attended to what was said but whose ear these two strong words caught with a tweak Never mind her sister let her talk Now just let her say anything she pleases to night She likes to come down hard upon your brother sometimes It amuses me so let her alone <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who mounted on a chair had been rummaging the bookcase returned with a book Here s <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> she said and there s Coriolanus Now read and discover by the feelings the reading will give you at once how low and how high you are Come then sit near me and correct when I mispronounce I am to be the teacher then and you my pupil Ainsi soit il And <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> is our science since we are going to study It appears so And you are not going to be French and sceptical and sneering You are not going to think it a sign of wisdom to refuse to admire I don t know If you do <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I ll take <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> away and I ll shrivel up within myself and put on my bonnet and go home Sit down Here I begin One minute if you please brother interrupted mademoiselle When the gentleman of a family reads the ladies should always sew <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> dear child take your embroidery You may get three sprigs done to night <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> looked dismayed I can t see by lamp light my eyes are tired and I can t do two things well at once If I sew I cannot listen if I listen I cannot sew Fi donc Quel enfantillage began <PERSON>Hortense Mr Moore</PERSON> as usual suavely interposed Permit her to neglect the embroidery for this evening I wish her whole attention to be fixed on my accent and to ensure this she must follow the reading with her eyes she must look at the book He placed it between them reposed his arm on the back of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s chair and thus began to read The very first scene in Coriolanus came with smart relish to his intellectual palate and still as he read he warmed He delivered the haughty speech of <PERSON>Caius Marcius</PERSON> to the starving citizens with unction he did not say he thought his irrational pride right but he seemed to feel it so <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> looked up at him with a singular smile There s a vicious point hit already she said You sympathize with that proud patrician who does not sympathize with his famished fellow men and insults them There go on He proceeded The warlike portions did not rouse him much he said all that was out of date or should be the spirit displayed was barbarous yet the encounter single handed between <PERSON>Marcius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tullus Aufidius</PERSON> he delighted in As he advanced he forgot to criticise it was evident he appreciated the power the truth of each portion and stepping out of the narrow line of private prejudices began to revel in the large picture of human nature to feel the reality stamped upon the characters who were speaking from that page before him He did not read the comic scenes well and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> taking the book out of his hand read these parts for him From her he seemed to enjoy them and indeed she gave them with a spirit no one could have expected of her with a pithy expression with which she seemed gifted on the spot and for that brief moment only It may be remarked in passing that the general character of her conversation that evening whether serious or sprightly grave or gay was as of something untaught unstudied intuitive fitful when once gone no more to be reproduced as it had been than the glancing ray of the meteor than the tints of the dew gem than the colour or form of the sunset cloud than the fleeting and glittering ripple varying the flow of a rivulet Coriolanus in glory Coriolanus in disaster Coriolanus banished followed like giant shades one after the other Before the vision of the banished man <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s spirit seemed to pause He stood on the hearth of Aufidius s hall facing the image of greatness fallen but greater than ever in that low estate He saw the grim appearance the dark face bearing command in it the noble vessel with its tackle torn With the revenge of <PERSON>Caius Marcius Moore</PERSON> perfectly sympathized he was not scandalized by it and again <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> whispered There I see another glimpse of brotherhood in error The march on <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> the mother s supplication the long resistance the final yielding of bad passions to good which ever must be the case in a nature worthy the epithet of noble the rage of <PERSON>Aufidius</PERSON> at what he considered his ally s weakness the death of Coriolanus the final sorrow of his great enemy all scenes made of condensed truth and strength came on in succession and carried with them in their deep fast flow the heart and mind of reader and listener Now have you felt <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> some ten minutes after her cousin had closed the book I think so And have you felt anything in Coriolanus like you Perhaps I have Was he not faulty as well as great <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> nodded And what was his fault What made him hated by the citizens What caused him to be banished by his countrymen What do you think it was I ask again Whether was it pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From the casque to the cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controlled the war Well answer yourself Sphinx It was a spice of all and you must not be proud to your workpeople you must not neglect chances of soothing them and you must not be of an inflexible nature uttering a request as austerely as if it were a command That is the moral you tack to the play What puts such notions into your head A wish for your good a care for your safety dear <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and a fear caused by many things which I have heard lately that you will come to harm Who tells you these things I hear my uncle talk about you He praises your hard spirit your determined cast of mind your scorn of low enemies your resolution not to truckle to the mob as he says And would you have me truckle to them No not for the world I never wish you to lower yourself but somehow I cannot help thinking it unjust to include all poor working people under the general and insulting name of the mob and continually to think of them and treat them haughtily You are a little democrat <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> If your uncle knew what would he say I rarely talk to my uncle as you know and never about such things He thinks everything but sewing and cooking above women s comprehension and out of their line And do you fancy you comprehend the subjects on which you advise me As far as they concern you I comprehend them I know it would be better for you to be loved by your workpeople than to be hated by them and I am sure that kindness is more likely to win their regard than pride If you were proud and cold to me and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> should we love you When you are cold to me as you _are_ sometimes can I venture to be affectionate in return Now <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> I ve had my lesson both in languages and ethics with a touch on politics it is your turn <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> tells me you were much taken by a little piece of poetry you learned the other day a piece by poor Andr Ch nier La Jeune Captive Do you remember it still I think so Repeat it then Take your time and mind your accent especially let us have no English _u_ s <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> beginning in a low rather tremulous voice but gaining courage as she proceeded repeated the sweet verses of Ch nier The last three stanzas she rehearsed well Mon beau voyage encore est si loin de sa fin Je pars et des ormeaux qui bordent le chemin J ai pass le premiers peine Au banquet de la vie peine commenc Un instant seulement mes l vres ont press La coupe en mes mains encore pleine Je ne suis qu au printemps je veux voir la moisson Et comme le soleil de saison en saison Je veux achever mon ann e Brillante sur ma tige et l honneur du jardin Je n ai vu luire encore que les feux du matin Je veux achever ma journ e <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> listened at first with his eyes cast down but soon he furtively raised them Leaning back in his chair he could watch <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> without her perceiving where his gaze was fixed Her cheek had a colour her eyes a light her countenance an expression this evening which would have made even plain features striking but there was not the grievous defect of plainness to pardon in her case The sunshine was not shed on rough barrenness it fell on soft bloom Each lineament was turned with grace the whole aspect was pleasing At the present moment animated interested touched she might be called beautiful Such a face was calculated to awaken not only the calm sentiment of esteem the distant one of admiration but some feeling more tender genial intimate friendship perhaps affection interest When she had finished she turned to <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and met his eye Is that pretty well repeated she inquired smiling like any happy docile child I really don t know Why don t you know Have you not listened Yes and looked You are fond of poetry <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> When I meet with _real_ poetry I cannot rest till I have learned it by heart and so made it partly mine Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> now sat silent for several minutes It struck nine o clock <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> entered and said that Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s servant was come for Miss <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> Then the evening is gone already she observed and it will be long I suppose before I pass another here <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> had been for some time nodding over her knitting fallen into a doze now she made no response to the remark You would have no objection to come here oftener of an evening inquired <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> as he took her folded mantle from the side table where it still lay and carefully wrapped it round her I like to come here but I have no desire to be intrusive I am not hinting to be asked you must understand that Oh I understand thee child You sometimes lecture me for wishing to be rich <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> but if I _were_ rich you should live here always at any rate you should live with me wherever my habitation might be That would be pleasant and if you were poor ever so poor it would still be pleasant Good night <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I promised to walk with you up to the rectory I know you did but I thought you had forgotten and I hardly knew how to remind you though I wished to do it But would you like to go It is a cold night and as <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> is come there is no necessity Here is your muff don t wake <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> come The half mile to the rectory was soon traversed They parted in the garden without kiss scarcely with a pressure of hands yet <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> sent his cousin in excited and joyously troubled He had been singularly kind to her that day not in phrase compliment profession but in manner in look and in soft and friendly tones For himself he came home grave almost morose As he stood leaning on his own yard gate musing in the watery moonlight all alone the hushed dark mill before him the hill environed hollow round he exclaimed abruptly This won t do There s weakness there s downright ruin in all this However he added dropping his voice the frenzy is quite temporary I know it very well I have had it before It will be gone to morrow CHAPTER VII The Curates at Tea <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> was just eighteen years old and at eighteen the true narrative of life is yet to be commenced Before that time we sit listening to a tale a marvellous fiction delightful sometimes and sad sometimes almost always unreal Before that time our world is heroic its inhabitants half divine or semi demon its scenes are dream scenes darker woods and stranger hills brighter skies more dangerous waters sweeter flowers more tempting fruits wider plains drearier deserts sunnier fields than are found in nature overspread our enchanted globe What a moon we gaze on before that time How the trembling of our hearts at her aspect bears witness to its unutterable beauty As to our sun it is a burning heaven the world of gods At that time at eighteen drawing near the confines of illusive void dreams Elf land lies behind us the shores of Reality rise in front These shores are yet distant they look so blue soft gentle we long to reach them In sunshine we see a greenness beneath the azure as of spring meadows we catch glimpses of silver lines and imagine the roll of living waters Could we but reach this land we think to hunger and thirst no more whereas many a wilderness and often the flood of death or some stream of sorrow as cold and almost as black as death is to be crossed ere true bliss can be tasted Every joy that life gives must be earned ere it is secured and how hardly earned those only know who have wrestled for great prizes The heart s blood must gem with red beads the brow of the combatant before the wreath of victory rustles over it At eighteen we are not aware of this Hope when she smiles on us and promises happiness to morrow is implicitly believed Love when he comes wandering like a lost angel to our door is at once admitted welcomed embraced His quiver is not seen if his arrows penetrate their wound is like a thrill of new life There are no fears of poison none of the barb which no leech s hand can extract That perilous passion an agony ever in some of its phases with many an agony throughout is believed to be an unqualified good In short at eighteen the school of experience is to be entered and her humbling crushing grinding but yet purifying and invigorating lessons are yet to be learned Alas Experience No other mentor has so wasted and frozen a face as yours none wears a robe so black none bears a rod so heavy none with hand so inexorable draws the novice so sternly to his task and forces him with authority so resistless to its acquirement It is by your instructions alone that man or woman can ever find a safe track through life s wilds without it how they stumble how they stray On what forbidden grounds do they intrude down what dread declivities are they hurled <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> having been convoyed home by <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> had no wish to pass what remained of the evening with her uncle The room in which he sat was very sacred ground to her she seldom intruded on it and to night she kept aloof till the bell rang for prayers Part of the evening church service was the form of worship observed in Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s household He read it in his usual nasal voice clear loud and monotonous The rite over his niece according to her wont stepped up to him Good night uncle Hey You ve been gadding abroad all day visiting dining out and what not Only at the cottage And have you learned your lessons Yes And made a shirt Only part of one Well that will do Stick to the needle learn shirt making and gown making and piecrust making and you ll be a clever woman some day Go to bed now I m busy with a pamphlet here Presently the niece was enclosed in her small bedroom the door bolted her white dressing gown assumed her long hair loosened and falling thick soft and wavy to her waist and as resting from the task of combing it out she leaned her check on her hand and fixed her eyes on the carpet before her rose and close around her drew the visions we see at eighteen years Her thoughts were speaking with her speaking pleasantly as it seemed for she smiled as she listened She looked pretty meditating thus but a brighter thing than she was in that apartment the spirit of youthful Hope According to this flattering prophet she was to know disappointment to feel chill no more she had entered on the dawn of a summer day no false dawn but the true spring of morning and her sun would quickly rise Impossible for her now to suspect that she was the sport of delusion her expectations seemed warranted the foundation on which they rested appeared solid When people love the next step is they marry was her argument Now I love <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and I feel sure that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> loves me I have thought so many a time before to day I _felt_ it When I looked up at him after repeating Ch nier s poem his eyes what handsome eyes he has sent the truth through my heart Sometimes I am afraid to speak to him lest I should be too frank lest I should seem forward for I have more than once regretted bitterly overflowing superfluous words and feared I had said more than he expected me to say and that he would disapprove what he might deem my indiscretion now to night I could have ventured to express any thought he was so indulgent How kind he was as we walked up the lane He does not flatter or say foolish things his love making friendship I mean of course I don t yet account him my lover but I hope he will be so some day is not like what we read of in books it is far better original quiet manly sincere I _do_ like him I would be an excellent wife to him if he did marry me I would tell him of his faults for he has a few faults but I would study his comfort and cherish him and do my best to make him happy Now I am sure he will not be cold to morrow I feel almost certain that to morrow evening he will either come here or ask me to go there She recommenced combing her hair long as a mermaid s Turning her head as she arranged it she saw her own face and form in the glass Such reflections are soberizing to plain people their own eyes are not enchanted with the image they are confident then that the eyes of others can see in it no fascination But the fair must naturally draw other conclusions the picture is charming and must charm <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> saw a shape a head that daguerreotyped in that attitude and with that expression would have been lovely She could not choose but derive from the spectacle confirmation to her hopes It was then in undiminished gladness she sought her couch And in undiminished gladness she rose the next day As she entered her uncle s breakfast room and with soft cheerfulness wished him good morning even that little man of bronze himself thought for an instant his niece was growing a fine girl Generally she was quiet and timid with him very docile but not communicative this morning however she found many things to say Slight topics alone might be discussed between them for with a woman a girl Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> would touch on no other She had taken an early walk in the garden and she told him what flowers were beginning to spring there she inquired when the gardener was to come and trim the borders she informed him that certain starlings were beginning to build their nests in the church tower Briarfield church was close to <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> rectory she wondered the tolling of the bells in the belfry did not scare them Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> opined that they were like other fools who had just paired insensible to inconvenience just for the moment <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> made perhaps a little too courageous by her temporary good spirits here hazarded a remark of a kind she had never before ventured to make on observations dropped by her revered relative <PERSON>Uncle</PERSON> said she whenever you speak of marriage you speak of it scornfully Do you think people shouldn t marry It is decidedly the wisest plan to remain single especially for women Are all marriages unhappy Millions of marriages are unhappy If everybody confessed the truth perhaps all are more or less so You are always vexed when you are asked to come and marry a couple Why Because one does not like to act as accessory to the commission of a piece of pure folly Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> spoke so readily he seemed rather glad of the opportunity to give his niece a piece of his mind on this point Emboldened by the impunity which had hitherto attended her questions she went a little further But why said she should it be pure folly If two people like each other why shouldn t they consent to live together They tire of each other they tire of each other in a month A yokefellow is not a companion he or she is a fellow sufferer It was by no means na ve simplicity which inspired <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s next remark it was a sense of antipathy to such opinions and of displeasure at him who held them One would think you had never been married uncle One would think you were an old bachelor Practically I am so But you have been married Why were you so inconsistent as to marry Every man is mad once or twice in his life So you tired of my aunt and my aunt of you and you were miserable together Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> pushed out his cynical lip wrinkled his brown forehead and gave an inarticulate grunt Did she not suit you Was she not good tempered Did you not get used to her Were you not sorry when she died <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> said Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> bringing his hand slowly down to within an inch or two of the table and then smiting it suddenly on the mahogany understand this it is vulgar and puerile to confound generals with particulars In every case there is the rule and there are the exceptions Your questions are stupid and babyish Ring the bell if you have done breakfast The breakfast was taken away and that meal over it was the general custom of uncle and niece to separate and not to meet again till dinner but to day the niece instead of quitting the room went to the window seat and sat down there Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> looked round uneasily once or twice as if he wished her away but she was gazing from the window and did not seem to mind him so he continued the perusal of his morning paper a particularly interesting one it chanced to be as new movements had just taken place in the <LOCATION>Peninsula</LOCATION> and certain columns of the journal were rich in long dispatches from General Lord <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> He little knew meantime what thoughts were busy in his niece s mind thoughts the conversation of the past half hour had revived but not generated tumultuous were they now as disturbed bees in a hive but it was years since they had first made their cells in her brain She was reviewing his character his disposition repeating his sentiments on marriage Many a time had she reviewed them before and sounded the gulf between her own mind and his and then on the other side of the wide and deep chasm she had seen and she now saw another figure standing beside her uncle s a strange shape dim sinister scarcely earthly the half remembered image of her own father <PERSON>James Helstone Matthewson Helstone</PERSON> s brother <PERSON>Rumours</PERSON> had reached her ear of what that father s character was old servants had dropped hints she knew too that he was not a good man and that he was never kind to her She recollected a dark recollection it was some weeks that she had spent with him in a great town somewhere when she had had no maid to dress her or take care of her when she had been shut up day and night in a high garret room without a carpet with a bare uncurtained bed and scarcely any other furniture when he went out early every morning and often forgot to return and give her her dinner during the day and at night when he came back was like a madman furious terrible or still more painful like an idiot imbecile senseless She knew she had fallen ill in this place and that one night when she was very sick he had come raving into the room and said he would kill her for she was a burden to him Her screams had brought aid and from the moment she was then rescued from him she had never seen him except as a dead man in his coffin That was her father Also she had a mother though Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> never spoke to her of that mother though she could not remember having seen her but that she was alive she knew This mother was then the drunkard s wife What had _their_ marriage been <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> turning from the lattice whence she had been watching the starlings though without seeing them in a low voice and with a sad bitter tone thus broke the silence of the room You term marriage miserable I suppose from what you saw of my father and mother s If my mother suffered what I suffered when I was with papa she must have had a dreadful life Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> thus addressed wheeled about in his chair and looked over his spectacles at his niece He was taken aback Her father and mother What had put it into her head to mention her father and mother of whom he had never during the twelve years she had lived with him spoken to her That the thoughts were self matured that she had any recollections or speculations about her parents he could not fancy Your father and mother Who has been talking to you about them Nobody but I remember something of what papa was and I pity mamma Where is she This Where is she had been on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s lips hundreds of times before but till now she had never uttered it I hardly know returned Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> I was little acquainted with her I have not heard from her for years but wherever she is she thinks nothing of you she never inquires about you I have reason to believe she does not wish to see you Come it is school time You go to your cousin at ten don t you The clock has struck Perhaps <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> would have said more but <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> coming in informed her master that the churchwardens wanted to speak to him in the vestry He hastened to join them and his niece presently set out for the cottage The road from the rectory to Hollow s Mill inclined downwards she ran therefore almost all the way Exercise the fresh air the thought of seeing <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> at least of being on his premises in his vicinage revived her somewhat depressed spirits quickly Arriving in sight of the white house and within hearing of the thundering mill and its rushing watercourse the first thing she saw was <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> at his garden gate There he stood in his belted <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> blouse a light cap covering his head which undress costume suited him He was looking down the lane not in the direction of his cousin s approach She stopped withdrawing a little behind a willow and studied his appearance He has not his peer she thought He is as handsome as he is intelligent What a keen eye he has What clearly cut spirited features thin and serious but graceful I do like his face I do like his aspect I do like him so much better than any of those shuffling curates for instance better than anybody bonny <PERSON>Robert She</PERSON> sought bonny <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s presence speedily For his part when she challenged his sight I believe he would have passed from before her eyes like a phantom if he could but being a tall fact and no fiction he was obliged to stand the greeting He made it brief It was cousin like brother like friend like anything but lover like The nameless charm of last night had left his manner he was no longer the same man or at any rate the same heart did not beat in his breast Rude disappointment sharp cross At first the eager girl would not believe in the change though she saw and felt it It was difficult to withdraw her hand from his till he had bestowed at least something like a kind pressure it was difficult to turn her eyes from his eyes till his looks had expressed something more and fonder than that cool welcome A lover masculine so disappointed can speak and urge explanation a lover feminine can say nothing if she did the result would be shame and anguish inward remorse for self treachery Nature would brand such demonstration as a rebellion against her instincts and would vindictively repay it afterwards by the thunderbolt of self contempt smiting suddenly in secret Take the matter as you find it ask no questions utter no remonstrances it is your best wisdom You expected bread and you have got a stone break your teeth on it and don t shriek because the nerves are martyrized do not doubt that your mental stomach if you have such a thing is strong as an ostrich s the stone will digest You held out your hand for an egg and fate put into it a scorpion Show no consternation close your fingers firmly upon the gift let it sting through your palm Never mind in time after your hand and arm have swelled and quivered long with torture the squeezed scorpion will die and you will have learned the great lesson how to endure without a sob For the whole remnant of your life if you survive the test some it is said die under it you will be stronger wiser less sensitive This you are not aware of perhaps at the time and so cannot borrow courage of that hope Nature however as has been intimated is an excellent friend in such cases sealing the lips interdicting utterance commanding a placid dissimulation a dissimulation often wearing an easy and gay mien at first settling down to sorrow and paleness in time then passing away and leaving a convenient stoicism not the less fortifying because it is half bitter Half bitter Is that wrong No it should be bitter bitterness is strength it is a tonic Sweet mild force following acute suffering you find nowhere to talk of it is delusion There may be apathetic exhaustion after the rack If energy remains it will be rather a dangerous energy deadly when confronted with injustice Who has read the ballad of <PERSON>Puir Mary Lee</PERSON> that old Scotch ballad written I know not in what generation nor by what hand <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> had been ill used probably in being made to believe that truth which was falsehood She is not complaining but she is sitting alone in the snowstorm and you hear her thoughts They are not the thoughts of a model heroine under her circumstances but they are those of a deeply feeling strongly resentful peasant girl Anguish has driven her from the ingle nook of home to the white shrouded and icy hills Crouched under the cauld drift she recalls every image of horror the yellow wymed ask the hairy adder the auld moon bowing tyke the ghaist at e en the sour bullister the milk on the taed s back She hates these but waur she hates <PERSON>Robin</PERSON> a Ree Oh ance I lived happily by yon bonny burn The warld was in love wi me But now I maun sit neath the cauld drift and mourn And curse black <PERSON>Robin</PERSON> a Ree Then whudder awa thou bitter biting blast And sough through the scrunty tree And smoor me up in the snaw fu fast And n er let the sun me see Oh never melt awa thou wreath o snaw That s sae kind in graving me But hide me frae the scorn and guffaw O villains like <PERSON>Robin</PERSON> a Ree But what has been said in the last page or two is not germane to <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> s feelings or to the state of things between her and <PERSON>Robert Moore Robert</PERSON> had done her no wrong he had told her no lie it was she that was to blame if any one was What bitterness her mind distilled should and would be poured on her own head She had loved without being asked to love a natural sometimes an inevitable chance but big with misery <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> indeed had sometimes seemed to be fond of her but why Because she had made herself so pleasing to him he could not in spite of all his efforts help testifying a state of feeling his judgment did not approve nor his will sanction He was about to withdraw decidedly from intimate communication with her because he did not choose to have his affections inextricably entangled nor to be drawn despite his reason into a marriage he believed imprudent Now what was she to do To give way to her feelings or to vanquish them To pursue him or to turn upon herself If she is weak she will try the first expedient will lose his esteem and win his aversion if she has sense she will be her own governor and resolve to subdue and bring under guidance the disturbed realm of her emotions She will determine to look on life steadily as it is to begin to learn its severe truths seriously and to study its knotty problems closely conscientiously It appeared she had a little sense for she quitted <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> quietly without complaint or question without the alteration of a muscle or the shedding of a tear betook herself to her studies under <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> as usual and at dinner time went home without lingering When she had dined and found herself in the rectory drawing room alone having left her uncle over his temperate glass of port wine the difficulty that occurred to and embarrassed her was How am I to get through this day Last night she had hoped it would be spent as yesterday was that the evening would be again passed with happiness and <PERSON>Robert She</PERSON> had learned her mistake this morning and yet she could not settle down convinced that no chance would occur to recall her to Hollow s Cottage or to bring <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> again into her society He had walked up after tea more than once to pass an hour with her uncle The door bell had rung his voice had been heard in the passage just at twilight when she little expected such a pleasure and this had happened twice after he had treated her with peculiar reserve and though he rarely talked to her in her uncle s presence he had looked at her relentingly as he sat opposite her work table during his stay The few words he had spoken to her were comforting his manner on bidding her good night was genial Now he might come this evening said False Hope She almost knew it was False Hope which breathed the whisper and yet she listened She tried to read her thoughts wandered she tried to sew every stitch she put in was an _ennui_ the occupation was insufferably tedious she opened her desk and attempted to write a French composition she wrote nothing but mistakes Suddenly the door bell sharply rang her heart leaped she sprang to the drawing room door opened it softly peeped through the aperture <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> was admitting a visitor a gentleman a tall man just the height of <PERSON>Robert For</PERSON> one second she thought it was <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> for one second she exulted but the voice asking for Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> undeceived her That voice was an Irish voice consequently not <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s but the curate s <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s He was ushered into the dining room where doubtless he speedily helped his rector to empty the decanters It was a fact to be noted that at whatever house in <LOCATION>Briarfield Whinbury</LOCATION> or Nunnely one curate dropped in to a meal dinner or tea as the case might be another presently followed often two more Not that they gave each other the rendezvous but they were usually all on the run at the same time and when <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> for instance sought <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> at his lodgings and found him not he inquired whither he had posted and having learned of the landlady his destination hastened with all speed after him The same causes operated in the same way with <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> Thus it chanced on that afternoon that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s ears were three times tortured with the ringing of the bell and the advent of undesired guests for <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> followed <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> followed <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> and more wine was ordered up from the cellar into the dining room for though old Helstone chid the inferior priesthood when he found them carousing as he called it in their own tents yet at his hierarchical table he ever liked to treat them to a glass of his best and through the closed doors <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> heard their boyish laughter and the vacant cackle of their voices Her fear was lest they should stay to tea for she had no pleasure in making tea for that particular trio What distinctions people draw These three were men young men educated men like <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> yet for her how great the difference Their society was a bore his a delight Not only was she destined to be favoured with their clerical company but <ORGANIZATION>Fortune</ORGANIZATION> was at this moment bringing her four other guests lady guests all packed in a pony phaeton now rolling somewhat heavily along the road from Whinbury an elderly lady and three of her buxom daughters were coming to see her in a friendly way as the custom of that neighbourhood was Yes a fourth time the bell clanged <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> brought the present announcement to the drawing room <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> and the three Misses Sykes When <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was going to receive company her habit was to wring her hands very nervously to flush a little and come forward hurriedly yet hesitatingly wishing herself meantime at <LOCATION>Jericho</LOCATION> She was at such crises sadly deficient in finished manner though she had once been at school a year Accordingly on this occasion her small white hands sadly maltreated each other while she stood up waiting the entrance of Mrs Sykes In stalked that lady a tall bilious gentlewoman who made an ample and not altogether insincere profession of piety and was greatly given to hospitality towards the clergy In sailed her three daughters a showy trio being all three well grown and more or less handsome In English country ladies there is this point to be remarked Whether young or old pretty or plain dull or sprightly they all or almost all have a certain expression stamped on their features which seems to say I know I do not boast of it but I _know_ that I am the standard of what is proper let every one therefore whom I approach or who approaches me keep a sharp lookout for wherein they differ from me be the same in dress manner opinion principle or practice therein they are wrong Mrs and Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> far from being exceptions to this observation were pointed illustrations of its truth Miss <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> a well looked well meant and on the whole well dispositioned girl wore her complacency with some state though without harshness Miss <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> a beauty carried it more overbearingly she looked high and cold Miss <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> who was conceited dashing pushing flourished hers consciously and openly The mother evinced it with the gravity proper to her age and religious fame The reception was got through somehow <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was glad to see them an unmitigated fib hoped they were well hoped <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> s cough was better <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> had had a cough for the last twenty years hoped the Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> had left their sisters at home well to which inquiry the Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> sitting on three chairs opposite the music stool whereon <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had undesignedly come to anchor after wavering for some seconds between it and a large arm chair into which she at length recollected she ought to induct <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> and indeed that lady saved her the trouble by depositing herself therein the Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> replied to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> by one simultaneous bow very majestic and mighty awful A pause followed This bow was of a character to ensure silence for the next five minutes and it did <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> then inquired after <PERSON>Mr Helstone</PERSON> and whether he had had any return of rheumatism and whether preaching twice on a Sunday fatigued him and if he was capable of taking a full service now and on being assured he was she and all her daughters combining in chorus expressed their opinion that he was a wonderful man of his years Pause second Miss <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> getting up the steam in her turn asked whether <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had attended the Bible Society meeting which had been held at <LOCATION>Nunnely</LOCATION> last Thursday night The negative answer which truth compelled <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to utter for last Thursday evening she had been sitting at home reading a novel which <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> had lent her elicited a simultaneous expression of surprise from the lips of the four ladies We were all there said Miss <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> mamma and all of us We even persuaded papa to go <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> would insist upon it But he fell asleep while Mr <PERSON>Langweilig</PERSON> the German Moravian minister was speaking I felt quite ashamed he nodded so And there was Dr <PERSON>Broadbent</PERSON> cried <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> such a beautiful speaker You couldn t expect it of him for he is almost a vulgar looking man But such a dear man interrupted Mary And such a good man such a useful man added her mother Only like a butcher in appearance interposed the fair proud <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> I couldn t bear to look at him I listened with my eyes shut Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> felt her ignorance and incompetency Not having seen Dr <PERSON>Broadbent</PERSON> she could not give her opinion Pause third came on During its continuance <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was feeling at her heart s core what a dreaming fool she was what an unpractical life she led how little fitness there was in her for ordinary intercourse with the ordinary world She was feeling how exclusively she had attached herself to the white cottage in the Hollow how in the existence of one inmate of that cottage she had pent all her universe She was sensible that this would not do and that some day she would be forced to make an alteration It could not be said that she exactly wished to resemble the ladies before her but she wished to become superior to her present self so as to feel less scared by their dignity The sole means she found of reviving the flagging discourse was by asking them if they would all stay to tea and a cruel struggle it cost her to perform this piece of civility <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> had begun We are much obliged to you but when in came <ORGANIZATION>Fanny</ORGANIZATION> once more The gentlemen will stay the evening ma am was the message she brought from Mr Helstone What gentlemen have you now inquired Mrs Sykes Their names were specified she and her daughters interchanged glances The curates were not to them what they were to <PERSON>Caroline Mr Sweeting</PERSON> was quite a favourite with them even Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> rather so because he was a clergyman Really since you have company already I think we will stay remarked Mrs Sykes We shall be quite a pleasant little party I always like to meet the clergy And now <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had to usher them upstairs to help them to unshawl smooth their hair and make themselves smart to reconduct them to the drawing room to distribute amongst them books of engravings or odd things purchased from the Jew basket She was obliged to be a purchaser though she was but a slack contributor and if she had possessed plenty of money she would rather when it was brought to the rectory an awful incubus have purchased the whole stock than contributed a single pin cushion It ought perhaps to be explained in passing for the benefit of those who are not _au fait_ to the mysteries of the Jew basket and missionary basket that these _meubles_ are willow repositories of the capacity of a good sized family clothes basket dedicated to the purpose of conveying from house to house a monster collection of pin cushions needle books card racks workbags articles of infant wear etc etc etc made by the willing or reluctant hands of the Christian ladies of a parish and sold perforce to the heathenish gentlemen thereof at prices unblushingly exorbitant The proceeds of such compulsory sales are applied to the conversion of the Jews the seeking up of the ten missing tribes or to the regeneration of the interesting coloured population of the globe Each lady contributor takes it in her turn to keep the basket a month to sew for it and to foist off its contents on a shrinking male public An exciting time it is when that turn comes round Some active minded woman with a good trading spirit like it and enjoy exceedingly the fun of making hard handed worsted spinners cash up to the tune of four or five hundred per cent above cost price for articles quite useless to them other feebler souls object to it and would rather see the prince of darkness himself at their door any morning than that phantom basket brought with Mrs Rouse s compliments and please ma am she says it s your turn now Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s duties of hostess performed more anxiously than cheerily she betook herself to the kitchen to hold a brief privy council with <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> about the tea What a lot on em cried <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> who was cook And I put off the baking to day because I thought there would be bread plenty to fit while morning We shall never have enow Are there any tea cakes asked the young mistress Only three and a loaf I wish these fine folk would stay at home till they re asked and I want to finish trimming my hat bonnet she meant Then suggested <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to whom the importance of the emergency gave a certain energy <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> must run down to <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> and buy some muffins and crumpets and some biscuits And don t be cross <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> we can t help it now And which tea things are we to have Oh the best I suppose I ll get out the silver service And she ran upstairs to the plate closet and presently brought down teapot cream ewer and sugar basin And mun we have th urn Yes and now get it ready as quickly as you can for the sooner we have tea over the sooner they will go at least I hope so <PERSON>Heigh</PERSON> ho I wish they were gone she sighed as she returned to the drawing room Still she thought as she paused at the door ere opening it if <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> would but come even now how bright all would be How comparatively easy the task of amusing these people if he were present There would be an interest in hearing him talk though he never says much in company and in talking in his presence There can be no interest in hearing any of them or in speaking to them How they will gabble when the curates come in and how weary I shall grow with listening to them But I suppose I am a selfish fool These are very respectable gentlefolks I ought no doubt to be proud of their countenance I don t say they are not as good as I am far from it but they are different from me She went in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> people in those days took their tea round the table sitting well into it with their knees duly introduced under the mahogany It was essential to have a multitude of plates of bread and butter varied in sorts and plentiful in quantity It was thought proper too that on the centre plate should stand a glass dish of marmalade Among the viands was expected to be found a small assortment of cheesecakes and tarts If there was also a plate of thin slices of pink ham garnished with green parsley so much the better <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> the rector s cook fortunately knew her business as provider She had been put out of humour a little at first when the invaders came so unexpectedly in such strength but it appeared that she regained her cheerfulness with action for in due time the tea was spread forth in handsome style and neither ham tarts nor marmalade were wanting among its accompaniments The curates summoned to this bounteous repast entered joyous but at once on seeing the ladies of whose presence they had not been forewarned they came to a stand in the doorway <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> headed the party he stopped short and fell back almost capsizing <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> who was behind him <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> staggering three paces in retreat sent little <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> into the arms of old <ORGANIZATION>Helstone</ORGANIZATION> who brought up the rear There was some expostulation some tittering <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> was desired to mind what he was about and urged to push forward which at last he did though colouring to the top of his peaked forehead a bluish purple Helstone advancing set the shy curates aside welcomed all his fair guests shook hands and passed a jest with each and seated himself snugly between the lovely <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> and the dashing <PERSON>Hannah Miss Mary</PERSON> he requested to move to the seat opposite to him that he might see her if he couldn t be near her Perfectly easy and gallant in his way were his manners always to young ladies and most popular was he amongst them yet at heart he neither respected nor liked the sex and such of them as circumstances had brought into intimate relation with him had ever feared rather than loved him The curates were left to shift for themselves <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> who was the least embarrassed of the three took refuge beside <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> who he knew was almost as fond of him as if he had been her son <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> after making his general bow with a grace all his own and saying in a high pragmatical voice How d ye do Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> dropped into a seat at <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s elbow to her unmitigated annoyance for she had a peculiar antipathy to <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> on account of his stultified and immovable self conceit and his incurable narrowness of mind <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> grinning most unmeaningly inducted himself into the corresponding seat on the other side She was thus blessed in a pair of supporters neither of whom she knew would be of any mortal use whether for keeping up the conversation handing cups circulating the muffins or even lifting the plate from the slop basin Little Sweeting small and boyish as he was would have been worth twenty of them <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> though a ceaseless talker when there were only men present was usually tongue tied in the presence of ladies Three phrases however he had ready cut and dried which he never failed to produce 1stly Have you had a walk to day Miss Helstone 2ndly Have you seen your cousin <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> lately 3rdly Does your class at the Sunday school keep up its number These three questions being put and responded to between <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> reigned silence With <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> it was otherwise he was troublesome exasperating He had a stock of small talk on hand at once the most trite and perverse that can well be imagined abuse of the people of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> of the natives of <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> generally complaints of the want of high society of the backward state of civilization in these districts murmurings against the disrespectful conduct of the lower orders in the north toward their betters silly ridicule of the manner of living in these parts the want of style the absence of elegance as if he <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> had been accustomed to very great doings indeed an insinuation which his somewhat underbred manner and aspect failed to bear out These strictures he seemed to think must raise him in the estimation of Miss Helstone or of any other lady who heard him whereas with her at least they brought him to a level below contempt though sometimes indeed they incensed her for a <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> girl herself she hated to hear <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> abused by such a pitiful prater and when wrought up to a certain pitch she would turn and say something of which neither the matter nor the manner recommended her to Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> s good will She would tell him it was no proof of refinement to be ever scolding others for vulgarity and no sign of a good pastor to be eternally censuring his flock She would ask him what he had entered the church for since he complained there were only cottages to visit and poor people to preach to whether he had been ordained to the ministry merely to wear soft clothing and sit in king s houses These questions were considered by all the curates as to the last degree audacious and impious Tea was a long time in progress all the guests gabbled as their hostess had expected they would Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> being in excellent spirits when indeed was he ever otherwise in society attractive female society it being only with the one lady of his own family that he maintained a grim taciturnity kept up a brilliant flow of easy prattle with his right hand and left hand neighbours and even with his _vis vis_ Miss <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> though as <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> was the most sensible the least coquettish of the three to her the elderly widower was the least attentive At heart he could not abide sense in women He liked to see them as silly as light headed as vain as open to ridicule as possible because they were then in reality what he held them to be and wished them to be inferior toys to play with to amuse a vacant hour and to be thrown away <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> was his favourite <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> though beautiful egotistical and self satisfied was not quite weak enough for him She had some genuine self respect amidst much false pride and if she did not talk like an oracle neither would she babble like one crazy she would not permit herself to be treated quite as a doll a child a plaything she expected to be bent to like a queen <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> on the contrary demanded no respect only flattery If her admirers only _told_ her that she was an angel she would let them _treat_ her like an idiot So very credulous and frivolous was she so very silly did she become when besieged with attention flattered and admired to the proper degree that there were moments when <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> actually felt tempted to commit matrimony a second time and to try the experiment of taking her for his second helpmeet but fortunately the salutary recollection of the _ennuis_ of his first marriage the impression still left on him of the weight of the millstone he had once worn round his neck the fixity of his feelings respecting the insufferable evils of conjugal existence operated as a check to his tenderness suppressed the sigh heaving his old iron lungs and restrained him from whispering to <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> proposals it would have been high fun and great satisfaction to her to hear It is probable she would have married him if he had asked her her parents would have quite approved the match To them his fifty five years his bend leather heart could have presented no obstacles and as he was a rector held an excellent living occupied a good house and was supposed even to have private property though in that the world was mistaken every penny of the 5 000 inherited by him from his father had been devoted to the building and endowing of a new church at his native village in <LOCATION>Lancashire</LOCATION> for he could show a lordly munificence when he pleased and if the end was to his liking never hesitated about making a grand sacrifice to attain it her parents I say would have delivered <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> over to his lovingkindness and his tender mercies without one scruple and the second Mrs Helstone inverting the natural order of insect existence would have fluttered through the honeymoon a bright admired butterfly and crawled the rest of her days a sordid trampled worm Little Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> seated between <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> and Miss <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> both of whom were very kind to him and having a dish of tarts before him and marmalade and crumpet upon his plate looked and felt more content than any monarch He was fond of all the Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> they were all fond of him He thought them magnificent girls quite proper to mate with one of his inches If he had a cause of regret at this blissful moment it was that Miss <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> happened to be absent <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> being the one whom he secretly hoped one day to call Mrs <PERSON>David Sweeting</PERSON> with whom he dreamt of taking stately walks leading her like an empress through the village of <LOCATION>Nunnely</LOCATION> and an empress she would have been if size could make an empress She was vast ponderous Seen from behind she had the air of a very stout lady of forty but withal she possessed a good face and no unkindly character The meal at last drew to a close It would have been over long ago if Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> had not persisted in sitting with his cup half full of cold tea before him long after the rest had finished and after he himself had discussed such allowance of viands as he felt competent to swallow long indeed after signs of impatience had been manifested all round the board till chairs were pushed back till the talk flagged till silence fell Vainly did <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> inquire repeatedly if he would have another cup if he would take a little hot tea as that must be cold etc he would neither drink it nor leave it He seemed to think that this isolated position of his gave him somehow a certain importance that it was dignified and stately to be the last that it was grand to keep all the others waiting So long did he linger that the very urn died it ceased to hiss At length however the old rector himself who had hitherto been too pleasantly engaged with <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> to care for the delay got impatient For whom are we waiting he asked For me I believe returned <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> complacently appearing to think it much to his credit that a party should thus be kept dependent on his movements <PERSON>Tut</PERSON> cried Helstone Then standing up Let us return thanks said he which he did forthwith and all quitted the table <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> nothing abashed still sat ten minutes quite alone whereupon Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> rang the bell for the things to be removed The curate at length saw himself forced to empty his cup and to relinquish the _r le_ which he thought had given him such a felicitous distinction drawing upon him such flattering general notice And now in the natural course of events <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knowing how it would be had opened the piano and produced music books in readiness music was asked for This was Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> s chance for showing off He was eager to commence He undertook therefore the arduous task of persuading the young ladies to favour the company with an air a song _Con amore_ he went through the whole business of begging praying resisting excuses explaining away difficulties and at last succeeded in persuading Miss <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> to allow herself to be led to the instrument Then out came the pieces of his flute he always carried them in his pocket as unfailingly as he carried his handkerchief They were screwed and arranged <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> meanwhile herding together and sneering at him which the little man glancing over his shoulder saw but did not heed at all He was persuaded their sarcasm all arose from envy They could not accompany the ladies as he could he was about to enjoy a triumph over them The triumph began <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> much chagrined at hearing him pipe up in most superior style determined to earn distinction too if possible and all at once assuming the character of a swain which character he had endeavoured to enact once or twice before but in which he had not hitherto met with the success he doubtless opined his merits deserved approached a sofa on which Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was seated and depositing his great Irish frame near her tried his hand or rather tongue at a fine speech or two accompanied by grins the most extraordinary and incomprehensible In the course of his efforts to render himself agreeable he contrived to possess himself of the two long sofa cushions and a square one with which after rolling them about for some time with strange gestures he managed to erect a sort of barrier between himself and the object of his attentions <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> quite willing that they should be sundered soon devised an excuse for stepping over to the opposite side of the room and taking up a position beside Mrs Sykes of which good lady she entreated some instruction in a new stitch in ornamental knitting a favour readily granted and thus <PERSON>Peter Augustus</PERSON> was thrown out Very sullenly did his countenance lower when he saw himself abandoned left entirely to his own resources on a large sofa with the charge of three small cushions on his hands The fact was he felt disposed seriously to cultivate acquaintance with Miss Helstone because he thought in common with others that her uncle possessed money and concluded that since he had no children he would probably leave it to his niece <PERSON>G rard Moore</PERSON> was better instructed on this point he had seen the neat church that owed its origin to the rector s zeal and cash and more than once in his inmost soul had cursed an expensive caprice which crossed his wishes The evening seemed long to one person in that room <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> at intervals dropped her knitting on her lap and gave herself up to a sort of brain lethargy closing her eyes and depressing her head caused by what seemed to her the unmeaning hum around her the inharmonious tasteless rattle of the piano keys the squeaking and gasping notes of the flute the laughter and mirth of her uncle and <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> she could not tell whence originating for she heard nothing comic or gleeful in their discourse and more than all by the interminable gossip of <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> murmured close at her ear gossip which rang the changes on four subjects her own health and that of the various members of her family the missionary and Jew baskets and their contents the late meeting at <LOCATION>Nunnely</LOCATION> and one which was expected to come off next week at <LOCATION>Whinbury Tired</LOCATION> at length to exhaustion she embraced the opportunity of Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> coming up to speak to <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> to slip quietly out of the apartment and seek a moment s respite in solitude She repaired to the dining room where the clear but now low remnant of a fire still burned in the grate The place was empty and quiet glasses and decanters were cleared from the table the chairs were put back in their places all was orderly <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sank into her uncle s large easy chair half shut her eyes and rested herself rested at least her limbs her senses her hearing her vision weary with listening to nothing and gazing on vacancy As to her mind that flew directly to the Hollow It stood on the threshold of the parlour there then it passed to the counting house and wondered which spot was blessed by the presence of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> It so happened that neither locality had that honour for <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was half a mile away from both and much nearer to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> than her deadened spirit suspected He was at this moment crossing the churchyard approaching the rectory garden gate not however coming to see his cousin but intent solely on communicating a brief piece of intelligence to the rector Yes <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> you hear the wire of the bell vibrate it rings again for the fifth time this afternoon You start and you are certain now that this must be he of whom you dream Why you are so certain you cannot explain to yourself but you know it You lean forward listening eagerly as <ORGANIZATION>Fanny</ORGANIZATION> opens the door Right That is _the_ voice low with the slight foreign accent but so sweet as you fancy You half rise <ORGANIZATION>Fanny</ORGANIZATION> will tell him Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> is with company and then he will go away Oh she cannot let him go In spite of herself in spite of her reason she walks half across the room she stands ready to dart out in case the step should retreat but he enters the passage Since your master is engaged he says just show me into the dining room Bring me pen and ink I will write a short note and leave it for him Now having caught these words and hearing him advance <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> if there was a door within the dining room would glide through it and disappear She feels caught hemmed in she dreads her unexpected presence may annoy him A second since she would have flown to him that second past she would flee from him She cannot There is no way of escape The dining room has but one door through which now enters her cousin The look of troubled surprise she expected to see in his face has appeared there has shocked her and is gone She has stammered a sort of apology I only left the drawing room a minute for a little quiet There was something so diffident and downcast in the air and tone with which she said this any one might perceive that some saddening change had lately passed over her prospects and that the faculty of cheerful self possession had left her Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> probably remembered how she had formerly been accustomed to meet him with gentle ardour and hopeful confidence He must have seen how the check of this morning had operated Here was an opportunity for carrying out his new system with effect if he chose to improve it Perhaps he found it easier to practise that system in broad daylight in his mill yard amidst busy occupations than in a quiet parlour disengaged at the hour of eventide <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> lit the candles which before had stood unlit on the table brought writing materials and left the room <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was about to follow her <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to act consistently should have let her go whereas he stood in the doorway and holding out his hand gently kept her back He did not ask her to stay but he would not let her go Shall I tell my uncle you are here asked she still in the same subdued voice No I can say to you all I had to say to him You will be my messenger Yes <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Then you may just inform him that I have got a clue to the identity of one at least of the men who broke my frames that he belongs to the same gang who attacked <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> s dressing shop and that I hope to have him in custody to morrow You can remember that Oh yes These two monosyllables were uttered in a sadder tone than ever and as she said them she shook her head slightly and sighed Will you prosecute him Doubtless No <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> And why no Caroline Because it will set all the neighbourhood against you more than ever That is no reason why I should not do my duty and defend my property This fellow is a great scoundrel and ought to be incapacitated from perpetrating further mischief But his accomplices will take revenge on you You do not know how the people of this country bear malice It is the boast of some of them that they can keep a stone in their pocket seven years turn it at the end of that time keep it seven years longer and hurl it and hit their mark at last <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> laughed A most pithy vaunt said he one that redounds vastly to the credit of your dear <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> friends But don t fear for me <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> I am on my guard against these lamb like compatriots of yours <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t make yourself uneasy about me How can I help it You are my cousin If anything happened She stopped Nothing will happen <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> To speak in your own language there is a <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> above all is there not Yes dear <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> May He guard you And if prayers have efficacy yours will benefit me You pray for me sometimes Not _sometimes_ <PERSON>Robert You</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> are _always_ remembered So I have often imagined It has occurred to me when weary and vexed I have myself gone to bed like a heathen that another had asked forgiveness for my day and safety for my night I don t suppose such vicarial piety will avail much but the petitions come out of a sincere breast from innocent lips They should be acceptable as <PERSON>Abel</PERSON> s offering and doubtless would be if the object deserved them Annihilate that doubt It is groundless When a man has been brought up only to make money and lives to make it and for nothing else and scarcely breathes any other air than that of mills and markets it seems odd to utter his name in a prayer or to mix his idea with anything divine and very strange it seems that a good pure heart should take him in and harbour him as if he had any claim to that sort of nest If I could guide that benignant heart I believe I should counsel it to exclude one who does not profess to have any higher aim in life than that of patching up his broken fortune and wiping clean from his _bourgeois_ scutcheon the foul stain of bankruptcy The hint though conveyed thus tenderly and modestly as <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> thought was felt keenly and comprehended clearly Indeed I only think or I _will only_ think of you as my cousin was the quick answer I am beginning to understand things better than I did <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> when you first came to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> better than I did a week a day ago I know it is your duty to try to get on and that it won t do for you to be romantic but in future you must not misunderstand me if I seem friendly You misunderstood me this morning did you not What made you think so Your look your manner But look at me now Oh you are different now At present I dare speak to you Yet I am the same except that I have left the tradesman behind me in the Hollow Your kinsman alone stands before you My cousin <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> not Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Not a bit of Mr <PERSON>Moore Caroline</PERSON> Here the company was heard rising in the other room The door was opened the pony carriage was ordered shawls and bonnets were demanded Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> called for his niece I must go <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Yes you must go or they will come in and find us here and I rather than meet all that host in the passage will take my departure through the window Luckily it opens like a door One minute only put down the candle an instant good night I kiss you because we are cousins and being cousins one two three kisses are allowable <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> good night CHAPTER VIII NOAH AND MOSES The next day <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had risen before the sun and had taken a ride to <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> and back ere his sister had made the caf au lait or cut the tartines for his breakfast What business he transacted there he kept to himself <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> asked no questions it was not her wont to comment on his movements nor his to render an account of them The secrets of business complicated and often dismal mysteries were buried in his breast and never came out of their sepulchre save now and then to scare <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> or give a start to some foreign correspondent Indeed a general habit of reserve on whatever was important seemed bred in his mercantile blood Breakfast over he went to his counting house <PERSON>Henry Joe Scott</PERSON> s boy brought in the letters and the daily papers <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> seated himself at his desk broke the seals of the documents and glanced them over They were all short but not it seemed sweet probably rather sour on the contrary for as <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> laid down the last his nostrils emitted a derisive and defiant snuff and though he burst into no soliloquy there was a glance in his eye which seemed to invoke the devil and lay charges on him to sweep the whole concern to <LOCATION>Gehenna However</LOCATION> having chosen a pen and stripped away the feathered top in a brief spasm of finger fury only finger fury his face was placid he dashed off a batch of answers sealed them and then went out and walked through the mill On coming back he sat down to read his newspaper The contents seemed not absorbingly interesting he more than once laid it across his knee folded his arms and gazed into the fire he occasionally turned his head towards the window he looked at intervals at his watch in short his mind appeared preoccupied Perhaps he was thinking of the beauty of the weather for it was a fine and mild morning for the season and wishing to be out in the fields enjoying it The door of his counting house stood wide open The breeze and sunshine entered freely but the first visitant brought no spring perfume on its wings only an occasional sulphur puff from the soot thick column of smoke rushing sable from the gaunt mill chimney A dark blue apparition that of <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> fresh from a dyeing vat appeared momentarily at the open door uttered the words He s comed sir and vanished Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> raised not his eyes from the paper A large man broad shouldered and massive limbed clad in fustian garments and gray worsted stockings entered who was received with a nod and desired to take a seat which he did making the remark as he removed his hat a very bad one stowed it away under his chair and wiped his forehead with a spotted cotton handkerchief extracted from the hat crown that it was raight dahn warm for Febewerry Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> assented at least he uttered some slight sound which though inarticulate might pass for an assent The visitor now carefully deposited in the corner beside him an official looking staff which he bore in his hand this done he whistled probably by way of appearing at his ease You have what is necessary I suppose said Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Ay ay all s right He renewed his whistling Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> his reading The paper apparently had become more interesting Presently however he turned to his cupboard which was within reach of his long arm opened it without rising took out a black bottle the same he had produced for <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> s benefit a tumbler and a jug placed them on the table and said to his guest Help yourself there s water in that jar in the corner I dunnut knaw that there s mich need for all a body is dry thirsty in a morning said the fustian gentleman rising and doing as requested Will you tak naught yourseln Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> he inquired as with skilled hand he mixed a portion and having tested it by a deep draught sank back satisfied and bland in his seat <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> chary of words replied by a negative movement and murmur Yah d as good continued his visitor it uld set ye up wald a sup o this stuff Uncommon good hollands <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> get it fro furrin parts I se think Ay Tak my advice and try a glass on t Them lads at s coming ll keep ye talking nob dy knows how long <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> ll need propping Have you seen Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> this morning inquired <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I seed him a hauf an hour nay happen a quarter of an hour sin just afore I set off He said he aimed to come here and I sudn t wonder but ye ll have old <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> too I seed em saddling his little nag as I passed at back o t rectory The speaker was a true prophet for the trot of a little nag s hoofs was five minutes after heard in the yard It stopped and a well known nasal voice cried aloud Boy probably addressing <PERSON>Harry Scott</PERSON> who usually hung about the premises from 9 a m to 5 p m take my horse and lead him into the stable <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> came in marching nimbly and erect looking browner keener and livelier than usual Beautiful morning <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> How do my boy Ha whom have we here turning to the personage with the staff <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> What you re going to work directly On my word you lose no time But I come to ask explanations Your message was delivered to me Are you sure you are on the right scent How do you mean to set about the business Have you got a warrant <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> has Then you are going to seek him now I ll accompany you You will be spared that trouble sir he is coming to seek me I m just now sitting in state waiting his arrival And who is it One of my parishioners <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> had entered unobserved He now stood a most sinister phantom half his person being dyed of the deepest tint of indigo leaning on the desk His master s answer to the rector s question was a smile <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> took the word Putting on a quiet but pawky look he said It s a friend of yours Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> a gentleman you often speak of Indeed His name <PERSON>Joe You</PERSON> look well this morning Only the Rev Moses <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> t tub orator you call him sometimes I think Ah said the rector taking out his snuff box and administering to himself a very long pinch ah couldn t have supposed it Why the pious man never was a workman of yours <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> He s a tailor by trade And so much the worse grudge I owe him for interfering and setting my discarded men against me And <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was actually present at the battle of Stilbro Moor He went there wooden leg and all Ay sir said <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> he went there on horseback that his leg mightn t be noticed He was the captain and wore a mask The rest only had their faces blackened And how was he found out I ll tell you sir said <PERSON>Joe T maister</PERSON> s not so fond of talking I ve no objections He courted <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s sarvant lass and so it seems she would have nothing to say to him she either didn t like his wooden leg or she d some notion about his being a hypocrite Happen for women is queer hands we may say that amang werseln when there s none of em nigh she d have encouraged him in spite of his leg and his deceit just to pass time like I ve known some on em do as mich and some o t bonniest and mimmest looking too ay I ve seen clean trim young things that looked as denty and pure as daisies and wi time a body fun em out to be nowt but stinging venomed nettles <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> s a sensible fellow interjected <PERSON>Helstone Howsiver Sarah</PERSON> had another string to her bow <PERSON>Fred Murgatroyd</PERSON> one of our lads is for her and as women judge men by their faces and <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> has a middling face while <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> is none so handsome as we all knaw the lass took on wi Fred A two three months sin <PERSON>Murgatroyd</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> chanced to meet one Sunday night they d both come lurking about these premises wi the notion of counselling <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> to tak a bit of a walk wi them They fell out had a tussle and <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> was worsted for he s young and small and <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> for all he has only one leg is almost as strong as <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> there indeed anybody that hears him roaring at a revival or a love feast may be sure he s no weakling <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> you re insupportable here broke in Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> You spin out your explanation as <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> spins out his sermons The long and short of it is <PERSON>Murgatroyd</PERSON> was jealous of <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> and last night as he and a friend took shelter in a barn from a shower they heard and saw <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> conferring with some associates within From their discourse it was plain he had been the leader not only at <LOCATION>Stilbro Moor</LOCATION> but in the attack on <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> s property Moreover they planned a deputation to wait on me this morning which the tailor is to head and which in the most religious and peaceful spirit is to entreat me to put the accursed thing out of my tent I rode over to <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> this morning got a constable and a warrant and I am now waiting to give my friend the reception he deserves Here meantime comes Sykes Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> you must spirit him up He feels timid at the thoughts of prosecuting A gig was heard to roll into the yard Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> entered a tall stout man of about fifty comely of feature but feeble of physiognomy He looked anxious Have they been Are they gone Have you got him Is it over he asked Not yet returned <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> with phlegm We are waiting for them They ll not come it s near noon Better give it up It will excite bad feeling make a stir cause perhaps fatal consequences _You_ need not appear said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I shall meet them in the yard when they come _you_ can stay here But my name must be seen in the law proceedings A wife and family Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> a wife and family make a man cautious <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> looked disgusted Give way if you please said he leave me to myself I have no objection to act alone only be assured you will not find safety in submission Your partner <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> gave way and conceded and forbore Well that did not prevent them from attempting to shoot him in his own house My dear sir take a little wine and water recommended Mr Helstone The wine and water was hollands and water as Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> discovered when he had compounded and swallowed a brimming tumbler thereof It transfigured him in two minutes brought the colour back to his face and made him at least _word_ valiant He now announced that he hoped he was above being trampled on by the common people he was determined to endure the insolence of the working classes no longer he had considered of it and made up his mind to go all lengths if money and spirit could put down these rioters they should be put down Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> might do as he liked but _he_ <PERSON>Christie Sykes</PERSON> would spend his last penny in law before he would be beaten he d settle them or he d see Take another glass urged <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> didn t mind if he did This was a cold morning <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> had found it a warm one it was necessary to be careful at this season of the year it was proper to take something to keep the damp out he had a little cough already here he coughed in attestation of the fact something of this sort lifting the black bottle was excellent taken medicinally he poured the physic into his tumbler he didn t make a practice of drinking spirits in a morning but occasionally it really was prudent to take precautions Quite prudent and take them by all means urged the host Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> now addressed Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> who stood on the hearth his shovel hat on his head watching him significantly with his little keen eyes You sir as a clergyman said he may feel it disagreeable to be present amidst scenes of hurry and flurry and I may say peril I dare say your nerves won t stand it You re a man of peace sir but we manufacturers living in the world and always in turmoil get quite belligerent Really there s an ardour excited by the thoughts of danger that makes my heart pant When <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> is afraid of the house being attacked and broke open as she is every night I get quite excited I couldn t describe to you sir my feelings Really if anybody was to come thieves or anything I believe I should enjoy it such is my spirit The hardest of laughs though brief and low and by no means insulting was the response of the rector <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> would have pressed upon the heroic mill owner a third tumbler but the clergyman who never transgressed nor would suffer others in his presence to transgress the bounds of decorum checked him Enough is as good as a feast is it not Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> he said and Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> assented and then sat and watched <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> remove the bottle at a sign from <LOCATION>Helstone</LOCATION> with a self satisfied simper on his lips and a regretful glisten in his eye <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> looked as if he should have liked to fool him to the top of his bent What would a certain young kinswoman of his have said could she have seen her dear good great <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> her Coriolanus just now Would she have acknowledged in that mischievous sardonic visage the same face to which she had looked up with such love which had bent over her with such gentleness last night Was that the man who had spent so quiet an evening with his sister and his cousin so suave to one so tender to the other reading <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> and listening to Ch nier Yes it was the same man only seen on a different side a side <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had not yet fairly beheld though perhaps she had enough sagacity faintly to suspect its existence Well <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had doubtless her defective side too She was human She must then have been very imperfect and had she seen <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> on his very worst side she would probably have said this to herself and excused him Love can excuse anything except meanness but meanness kills love cripples even natural affection without esteem true love cannot exist <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> with all his faults might be esteemed for he had no moral scrofula in his mind no hopeless polluting taint such for instance as that of falsehood neither was he the slave of his appetites The active life to which he had been born and bred had given him something else to do than to join the futile chase of the pleasure hunter He was a man undegraded the disciple of reason _not_ the votary of sense The same might be said of old Helstone Neither of these two would look think or speak a lie for neither of them had the wretched black bottle which had just been put away any charms Both might boast a valid claim to the proud title of lord of the creation for no animal vice was lord of them they looked and were superior beings to poor <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> A sort of gathering and trampling sound was heard in the yard and then a pause <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> walked to the window <ORGANIZATION>Helstone</ORGANIZATION> followed Both stood on one side the tall junior behind the under sized senior looking forth carefully so that they might not be visible from without Their sole comment on what they saw was a cynical smile flashed into each other s stern eyes A flourishing oratorical cough was now heard followed by the interjection Whisht designed as it seemed to still the hum of several voices <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> opened his casement an inch or two to admit sound more freely <PERSON>Joseph Scott</PERSON> began a snuffling voice <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> was standing sentinel at the counting house door might we inquire if your master be within and is to be spoken to He s within ay said <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> nonchalantly Would you then if _you_ please emphasis on you have the goodness to tell _him_ that twelve gentlemen wants to see him He d happen ax what for suggested <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I mught as weel tell him that at t same time For a purpose was the answer <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> entered Please sir there s twelve gentlemen wants to see ye for a purpose Good <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I m their man <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> come when I whistle <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> went out chuckling dryly He advanced into the yard one hand in his pocket the other in his waistcoat his cap brim over his eyes shading in some measure their deep dancing ray of scorn Twelve men waited in the yard some in their shirt sleeves some in blue aprons Two figured conspicuously in the van of the party One a little dapper strutting man with a turned up nose the other a broad shouldered fellow distinguished no less by his demure face and cat like trustless eyes than by a wooden leg and stout crutch There was a kind of leer about his lips he seemed laughing in his sleeve at some person or thing his whole air was anything but that of a true man Good morning Mr <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> debonairly for him Peace be unto you was the answer Mr <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> entirely closing his naturally half shut eyes as he delivered it I m obliged to you Peace is an excellent thing there s nothing I more wish for myself But that is not all you have to say to me I suppose I imagine peace is not your purpose As to our purpose began <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> it s one that may sound strange and perhaps foolish to ears like yours for the childer of this world is wiser in their generation than the childer of light To the point if you please and let me hear what it is <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> se hear sir If I cannot get it off there s eleven behint can help me It is a grand purpose and changing his voice from a half sneer to a whine it s the Looard s own purpose and that s better Do you want a subscription to a new Ranter s chapel Mr <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> Unless your errand be something of that sort I cannot see what you have to do with it I hadn t that duty on my mind sir but as <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> has led ye to mention the subject I ll make it i my way to tak ony trifle ye may have to spare the smallest contribution will be acceptable With that he doffed his hat and held it out as a begging box a brazen grin at the same time crossing his countenance If I gave you sixpence you would drink it <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> uplifted the palms of his hands and the whites of his eyes evincing in the gesture a mere burlesque of hypocrisy You seem a fine fellow said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> quite coolly and dryly you don t care for showing me that you are a double dyed hypocrite that your trade is fraud You expect indeed to make me laugh at the cleverness with which you play your coarsely farcical part while at the same time you think you are deceiving the men behind you Moses countenance lowered He saw he had gone too far He was going to answer when the second leader impatient of being hitherto kept in the background stepped forward This man did not look like a traitor though he had an exceedingly self confident and conceited air Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> commenced he speaking also in his throat and nose and enunciating each word very slowly as if with a view to giving his audience time to appreciate fully the uncommon elegance of the phraseology it might perhaps justly be said that reason rather than peace is our purpose We come in the first place to request you to hear reason and should _you_ refuse it is my duty to warn _you_ in very decided terms that measures will be had resort to he meant recourse which will probably terminate in in bringing _you_ to a sense of the unwisdom of the the foolishness which seems to guide and guard your proceedings as a tradesman in this manufacturing part of the country Hem Sir I would beg to allude that as a furriner coming from a distant coast another quarter and hemisphere of this globe thrown as I may say a perfect outcast on these shores the cliffs of <ORGANIZATION>Albion</ORGANIZATION> you have not that understanding of huz and wer ways which might conduce to the benefit of the working classes If to come at once to partic lars you d consider to give up this here miln and go without further protractions straight home to where you belong it ud happen be as well I can see naught ageean such a plan What hev ye to say tull t lads turning round to the other members of the deputation who responded unanimously Hear hear <PERSON>Brayvo Noah</PERSON> o <PERSON>Tim</PERSON> s murmured <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> who stood behind Mr <PERSON>Moore Moses</PERSON> ll niver beat that Cliffs o <ORGANIZATION>Albion</ORGANIZATION> and t other hemisphere My certy Did ye come fro th <LOCATION>Antarctic Zone</LOCATION> maister <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> is dished <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> however refused to be dished He thought he would try again Casting a somewhat ireful glance at <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> o <PERSON>Tim</PERSON> s he launched out in his turn and now he spoke in a serious tone relinquishing the sarcasm which he found had not answered Or iver you set up the pole o your tent amang us Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> we lived i peace and quietness yea I may say in all loving kindness I am not myself an aged person as yet but I can remember as far back as maybe some twenty year when hand labour were encouraged and respected and no mischief maker had ventured to introduce these here machines which is so pernicious Now I m not a cloth dresser myself but by trade a tailor <PERSON>Howsiver</PERSON> my heart is of a softish nature I m a very feeling man and when I see my brethren oppressed like my great namesake of old I stand up for em for which intent I this day speak with you face to face and advises you to part wi your infernal machinery and tak on more hands What if I don t follow your advice Mr <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> The Looard pardon you The Looard soften your heart sir Are you in connection with the Wesleyans now Mr <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> Praise God Bless His name I m a joined Methody Which in no respect prevents you from being at the same time a drunkard and a swindler I saw you one night a week ago laid dead drunk by the roadside as I returned from <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> market and while you preach peace you make it the business of your life to stir up dissension You no more sympathize with the poor who are in distress than you sympathize with me You incite them to outrage for bad purposes of your own so does the individual called <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> of Tim s You two are restless meddling impudent scoundrels whose chief motive principle is a selfish ambition as dangerous as it is puerile The persons behind you are some of them honest though misguided men but you two I count altogether bad <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> was going to speak Silence You have had your say and now I will have mine As to being dictated to by you or any <PERSON>Jack Jem</PERSON> or <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> on earth I shall not suffer it for a moment You desire me to quit the country you request me to part with my machinery In case I refuse you threaten me I _do_ refuse point blank Here I stay and by this mill I stand and into it will I convey the best machinery inventors can furnish What will you do The utmost you _can_ do and this you will never _dare_ to do is to burn down my mill destroy its contents and shoot me What then Suppose that building was a ruin and I was a corpse what then you lads behind these two scamps Would that stop invention or exhaust science Not for the fraction of a second of time Another and better gig mill would rise on the ruins of this and perhaps a more enterprising owner come in my place Hear me I ll make my cloth as I please and according to the best lights I have In its manufacture I will employ what means I choose Whoever after hearing this shall dare to interfere with me may just take the consequences An example shall prove I m in earnest He whistled shrill and loud <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> his staff and warrant came on the scene <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> turned sharply to <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> You were at <PERSON>Stilbro</PERSON> said he I have proof of that You were on the moor you wore a mask you knocked down one of my men with your own hand you a preacher of the gospel <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> arrest him <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was captured There was a cry and a rush to rescue but the right hand which all this while had lain hidden in <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s breast reappearing held out a pistol Both barrels are loaded said he I m quite determined Keep off Stepping backwards facing the foe as he went he guarded his prey to the counting house He ordered <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> to pass in with <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> and the prisoner and to bolt the door inside For himself he walked backwards and forwards along the front of the mill looking meditatively on the ground his hand hanging carelessly by his side but still holding the pistol The eleven remaining deputies watched him some time talking under their breath to each other At length one of them approached This man looked very different from either of the two who had previously spoken he was hard favoured but modest and manly looking I ve not much faith i <PERSON>Moses Barraclough</PERSON> said he and I would speak a word to you myseln Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> It s out o no ill will that I m here for my part it s just to mak a effort to get things straightened for they re sorely a crooked <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> see we re ill off varry ill off wer families is poor and pined We re thrown out o work wi these frames we can get nought to do we can earn nought What is to be done <PERSON>Mun</PERSON> we say wisht and lig us down and dee Nay I ve no grand words at my tongue s end Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> but I feel that it wad be a low principle for a reasonable man to starve to death like a dumb cratur I willn t do t I m not for shedding blood I d neither kill a man nor hurt a man and I m not for pulling down mills and breaking machines for as ye say that way o going on ll niver stop invention but I ll talk I ll mak as big a din as ever I can Invention may be all right but I know it isn t right for poor folks to starve Them that governs mun find a way to help us they mun make fresh orderations <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> ll say that s hard to do So mich louder mun we shout out then for so much slacker will t <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> men be to set on to a tough job Worry the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> men as much as you please said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> but to worry the mill owners is absurd and I for one won t stand it <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> re a raight hard un returned the workman <PERSON>Willn</PERSON> t ye gie us a bit o time <PERSON>Willn</PERSON> t ye consent to mak your changes rather more slowly Am I the whole body of clothiers in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> Answer me that <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> re yourseln And only myself And if I stopped by the way an instant while others are rushing on I should be trodden down If I did as you wish me to do I should be bankrupt in a month and would my bankruptcy put bread into your hungry children s mouths <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> neither to your dictation nor to that of any other will I submit Talk to me no more about machinery I will have my own way I shall get new frames in to morrow If you broke these I would still get more _I ll never give in _ Here the mill bell rang twelve o clock It was the dinner hour <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> abruptly turned from the deputation and re entered his counting house His last words had left a bad harsh impression he at least had failed in the disposing of a chance he was lord of By speaking kindly to <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> who was a very honest man without envy or hatred of those more happily circumstanced than himself thinking it no hardship and no injustice to be forced to live by labour disposed to be honourably content if he could but get work to do <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> might have made a friend It seemed wonderful how he could turn from such a man without a conciliatory or a sympathizing expression The poor fellow s face looked haggard with want he had the aspect of a man who had not known what it was to live in comfort and plenty for weeks perhaps months past and yet there was no ferocity no malignity in his countenance it was worn dejected austere but still patient How could <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> leave him thus with the words I ll never give in and not a whisper of good will or hope or aid <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> as he went home to his cottage once in better times a decent clean pleasant place but now though still clean very dreary because so poor asked himself this question He concluded that the foreign mill owner was a selfish an unfeeling and he thought too a foolish man It appeared to him that emigration had he only the means to emigrate would be preferable to service under such a master He felt much cast down almost hopeless On his entrance his wife served out in orderly sort such dinner as she had to give him and the bairns It was only porridge and too little of that Some of the younger children asked for more when they had done their portion an application which disturbed <PERSON>William</PERSON> much While his wife quieted them as well as she could he left his seat and went to the door He whistled a cheery stave which did not however prevent a broad drop or two much more like the first of a thunder shower than those which oozed from the wound of the gladiator from gathering on the lids of his gray eyes and plashing thence to the threshold He cleared his vision with his sleeve and the melting mood over a very stern one followed He still stood brooding in silence when a gentleman in black came up a clergyman it might be seen at once but neither <LOCATION>Helstone</LOCATION> nor <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> nor Sweeting He might be forty years old he was plain looking dark complexioned and already rather gray haired He stooped a little in walking His countenance as he came on wore an abstracted and somewhat doleful air but in approaching <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> he looked up and then a hearty expression illuminated the preoccupied serious face Is it you <PERSON>William How</PERSON> are you he asked Middling Mr <PERSON>Hall How</PERSON> are _ye_ Will ye step in and rest ye Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> whose name the reader has seen mentioned before and who indeed was vicar of Nunnely of which parish <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> was a native and from whence he had removed but three years ago to reside in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> for the convenience of being near Hollow s Mill where he had obtained work entered the cottage and having greeted the good wife and the children sat down He proceeded to talk very cheerfully about the length of time that had elapsed since the family quitted his parish the changes which had occurred since he answered questions touching his sister <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> who was inquired after with much interest he asked questions in his turn and at last glancing hastily and anxiously round through his spectacles he wore spectacles for he was short sighted at the bare room and at the meagre and wan faces of the circle about him for the children had come round his knee and the father and mother stood before him he said abruptly And how are you all How do you get on Mr Hall be it remarked though an accomplished scholar not only spoke with a strong northern accent but on occasion used freely north country expressions We get on poorly said <PERSON>William</PERSON> we re all out of work I ve selled most o t household stuff as ye may see and what we re to do next God knows Has Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> turned you off He has turned us off and I ve sich an opinion of him now that I think if he d tak me on again to morrow I wouldn t work for him It is not like you to say so <PERSON>William I</PERSON> know it isn t but I m getting different to mysel I feel I am changing I wadn t heed if t bairns and t wife had enough to live on but they re pinched they re pined Well my lad and so are you I see you are These are grievous times I see suffering wherever I turn <PERSON>William</PERSON> sit down Grace sit down Let us talk it over And in order the better to talk it over Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> lifted the least of the children on to his knee and placed his hand on the head of the next least but when the small things began to chatter to him he bade them <PERSON>Whisht</PERSON> and fixing his eyes on the grate he regarded the handful of embers which burned there very gravely Sad times he said and they last long It is the will of God His will be done But He tries us to the utmost Again he reflected You ve no money <PERSON>William</PERSON> and you ve nothing you could sell to raise a small sum No I ve selled t chest o drawers and t clock and t bit of a mahogany stand and t wife s bonny tea tray and set o cheeney at she brought for a portion when we were wed And if somebody lent you a pound or two could you make any good use of it Could you get into a new way of doing something <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> did not answer but his wife said quickly Ay I m sure he could sir He s a very contriving chap is our William If he d two or three pounds he could begin selling stuff Could you <PERSON>William Please God</PERSON> returned <PERSON>William</PERSON> deliberately I could buy groceries and bits o tapes and thread and what I thought would sell and I could begin hawking at first And you know sir interposed Grace you re sure <PERSON>William</PERSON> would neither drink nor idle nor waste in any way He s my husband and I shouldn t praise him but I _will_ say there s not a soberer honester man i <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> nor he is Well I ll speak to one or two friends and I think I can promise to let him have 5 in a day or two as a loan ye mind not a gift He must pay it back I understand sir I m quite agreeable to that Meantime there s a few shillings for you Grace just to keep the pot boiling till custom comes Now bairns stand up in a row and say your catechism while your mother goes and buys some dinner for you ve not had much to day I ll be bound You begin <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> What is your name Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> stayed till <PERSON>Grace</PERSON> came back then he hastily took his leave shaking hands with both <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> and his wife Just at the door he said to them a few brief but very earnest words of religious consolation and exhortation With a mutual God bless you sir <PERSON>God</PERSON> bless you my friends they separated CHAPTER IX BRIARMAINS <PERSON>Messrs Helstone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> began to be extremely jocose and congratulatory with Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> when he returned to them after dismissing the deputation He was so quiet however under their compliments upon his firmness etc and wore a countenance so like a still dark day equally beamless and breezeless that the rector after glancing shrewdly into his eyes buttoned up his felicitations with his coat and said to <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> whose senses were not acute enough to enable him to discover unassisted where his presence and conversation were a nuisance Come sir your road and mine lie partly together Had we not better bear each other company We ll bid <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> good morning and leave him to the happy fancies he seems disposed to indulge And where is <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> demanded <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> looking up Ah ha cried Helstone I ve not been quite idle while you were busy I ve been helping you a little I flatter myself not injudiciously I thought it better not to lose time so while you were parleying with that down looking gentleman <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> I think his name is I opened this back window shouted to <PERSON>Murgatroyd</PERSON> who was in the stable to bring Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> s gig round then I smuggled <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> and brother <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> wooden leg and all through the aperture and saw them mount the gig always with our good friend <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> s permission of course <PERSON>Sugden</PERSON> took the reins he drives like <PERSON>Jehu</PERSON> and in another quarter of an hour <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> will be safe in <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> jail Very good thank you said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and good morning gentlemen he added and so politely conducted them to the door and saw them clear of his premises He was a taciturn serious man the rest of the day He did not even bandy a repartee with <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> who for his part said to his master only just what was absolutely necessary to the progress of business but looked at him a good deal out of the corners of his eyes frequently came to poke the counting house fire for him and once as he was locking up for the day the mill was then working short time owing to the slackness of trade observed that it was a grand evening and he could wish Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to take a bit of a walk up th Hollow It would do him good At this recommendation Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> burst into a short laugh and after demanding of <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> what all this solicitude meant and whether he took him for a woman or a child seized the keys from his hand and shoved him by the shoulders out of his presence He called him back however ere he had reached the yard gate <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> do you know those Farrens They are not well off I suppose They cannot be well off sir when they ve not had work as a three month <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> d see yoursel at <PERSON>William</PERSON> s sorely changed fair paired They ve selled most o t stuff out o th house He was not a bad workman <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> never had a better sir sin ye began trade And decent people the whole family Niver dacenter Th wife s a raight cant body and as clean ye mught eat your porridge off th house floor They re sorely comed down I wish <PERSON>William</PERSON> could get a job as gardener or summat i that way he understands gardening weel He once lived wi a Scotchman that tached him the mysteries o that craft as they say Now then you can go <PERSON>Joe You</PERSON> need not stand there staring at me <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> ve no orders to give sir None but for you to take yourself off Which <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> did accordingly Spring evenings are often cold and raw and though this had been a fine day warm even in the morning and meridian sunshine the air chilled at sunset the ground crisped and ere dusk a hoar frost was insidiously stealing over growing grass and unfolding bud It whitened the pavement in front of Briarmains Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s residence and made silent havoc among the tender plants in his garden and on the mossy level of his lawn As to that great tree strong trunked and broad armed which guarded the gable nearest the road it seemed to defy a spring night frost to harm its still bare boughs and so did the leafless grove of walnut trees rising tall behind the house In the dusk of the moonless if starry night lights from windows shone vividly This was no dark or lonely scene nor even a silent one <PERSON>Briarmains</PERSON> stood near the highway It was rather an old place and had been built ere that highway was cut and when a lane winding up through fields was the only path conducting to it Briarfield lay scarce a mile off its hum was heard its glare distinctly seen <LOCATION>Briar Chapel</LOCATION> a large new raw <ORGANIZATION>Wesleyan</ORGANIZATION> place of worship rose but a hundred yards distant and as there was even now a prayer meeting being held within its walls the illumination of its windows cast a bright reflection on the road while a hymn of a most extraordinary description such as a very <ORGANIZATION>Quaker</ORGANIZATION> might feel himself moved by the Spirit to dance to roused cheerily all the echoes of the vicinage The words were distinctly audible by snatches Here is a quotation or two from different strains for the singers passed jauntily from hymn to hymn and from tune to tune with an ease and buoyancy all their own Oh who can explain This struggle for life This travail and pain This trembling and strife Plague earthquake and famine And tumult and war The wonderful coming Of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> declare For every fight Is dreadful and loud The warrior s delight Is slaughter and blood His foes overturning Till all shall expire And this is with burning And fuel and fire Here followed an interval of clamorous prayer accompanied by fearful groans A shout of I ve found liberty Doad o <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> s has fun liberty rang from the chapel and out all the assembly broke again What a mercy is this What a heaven of bliss How unspeakably happy am I Gathered into the fold With Thy people enrolled With Thy people to live and to die Oh the goodness of God In employing a clod His tribute of glory to raise His standard to bear And with triumph declare His unspeakable riches of grace Oh the fathomless love That has deigned to approve And prosper the work of my hands With my pastoral crook I went over the brook And behold I am spread into bands Who I ask in amaze Hath begotten me these And inquire from what quarter they came My full heart it replies They are born from the skies And gives glory to God and the Lamb The stanza which followed this after another and longer interregnum of shouts yells ejaculations frantic cries agonized groans seemed to cap the climax of noise and zeal Sleeping on the brink of sin <PERSON>Tophet</PERSON> gaped to take us in Mercy to our rescue flew Broke the snare and brought us through Here as in a lion s den Undevoured we still remain Pass secure the watery flood Hanging on the arm of God Here Terrible most distracting to the ear was the strained shout in which the last stanza was given Here we raise our voices higher Shout in the refiner s fire Clap our hands amidst the flame Glory give to <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> name The roof of the chapel did _not_ fly off which speaks volumes in praise of its solid slating But if <ORGANIZATION>Briar Chapel</ORGANIZATION> seemed alive so also did <PERSON>Briarmains</PERSON> though certainly the mansion appeared to enjoy a quieter phase of existence than the temple Some of its windows too were aglow the lower casements opened upon the lawn curtains concealed the interior and partly obscured the ray of the candles which lit it but they did not entirely muffle the sound of voice and laughter We are privileged to enter that front door and to penetrate to the domestic sanctum It is not the presence of company which makes Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s habitation lively for there is none within it save his own family and they are assembled in that farthest room to the right the back parlour This is the usual sitting room of an evening Those windows would be seen by daylight to be of brilliantly stained glass purple and amber the predominant hues glittering round a gravely tinted medallion in the centre of each representing the suave head of <PERSON>William Shakespeare</PERSON> and the serene one of <PERSON>John Milton</PERSON> Some Canadian views hung on the walls green forest and blue water scenery and in the midst of them blazes a night eruption of Vesuvius very ardently it glows contrasted with the cool foam and azure of cataracts and the dusky depths of woods The fire illuminating this room reader is such as if you be a southern you do not often see burning on the hearth of a private apartment It is a clear hot coal fire heaped high in the ample chimney Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> _will_ have such fires even in warm summer weather He sits beside it with a book in his hand a little round stand at his elbow supporting a candle but he is not reading he is watching his children Opposite to him sits his lady a personage whom I might describe minutely but I feel no vocation to the task I see her though very plainly before me a large woman of the gravest aspect care on her front and on her shoulders but not overwhelming inevitable care rather the sort of voluntary exemplary cloud and burden people ever carry who deem it their duty to be gloomy Ah well a day <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> had that notion and grave as Saturn she was morning noon and night and hard things she thought if any unhappy wight especially of the female sex who dared in her presence to show the light of a gay heart on a sunny countenance In her estimation to be mirthful was to be profane to be cheerful was to be frivolous She drew no distinctions Yet she was a very good wife a very careful mother looked after her children unceasingly was sincerely attached to her husband only the worst of it was if she could have had her will she would not have permitted him to have any friend in the world beside herself All his relations were insupportable to her and she kept them at arm s length Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and she agreed perfectly well yet he was naturally a social hospitable man an advocate for family unity and in his youth as has been said he liked none but lively cheerful women Why he chose her how they contrived to suit each other is a problem puzzling enough but which might soon be solved if one had time to go into the analysis of the case Suffice it here to say that <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> had a shadowy side as well as a sunny side to his character and that his shadowy side found sympathy and affinity in the whole of his wife s uniformly overcast nature For the rest she was a strong minded woman never said a weak or a trite thing took stern democratic views of society and rather cynical ones of human nature considered herself perfect and safe and the rest of the world all wrong Her main fault was a brooding eternal immitigable suspicion of all men things creeds and parties this suspicion was a mist before her eyes a false guide in her path wherever she looked wherever she turned It may be supposed that the children of such a pair were not likely to turn out quite ordinary commonplace beings and they were not You see six of them reader The youngest is a baby on the mother s knee It is all her own yet and that one she has not yet begun to doubt suspect condemn it derives its sustenance from her it hangs on her it clings to her it loves her above everything else in the world She is sure of that because as it lives by her it cannot be otherwise therefore she loves it The two next are girls <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> they are both now at their father s knee they seldom go near their mother except when obliged to do so <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> the elder is twelve years old she is like her father the most like him of the whole group but it is a granite head copied in ivory all is softened in colour and line <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> himself has a harsh face his daughter s is not harsh neither is it quite pretty it is simple childlike in feature the round cheeks bloom as to the gray eyes they are otherwise than childlike a serious soul lights them a young soul yet but it will mature if the body lives and neither father nor mother have a spirit to compare with it Partaking of the essence of each it will one day be better than either stronger much purer more aspiring <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> is a still sometimes a stubborn girl now Her mother wants to make of her such a woman as she is herself a woman of dark and dreary duties and <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> has a mind full set thick sown with the germs of ideas her mother never knew It is agony to her often to have these ideas trampled on and repressed She has never rebelled yet but if hard driven she will rebel one day and then it will be once for all <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> loves her father her father does not rule her with a rod of iron he is good to her He sometimes fears she will not live so bright are the sparks of intelligence which at moments flash from her glance and gleam in her language This idea makes him often sadly tender to her He has no idea that little <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> will die young she is so gay and chattering arch original even now passionate when provoked but most affectionate if caressed by turns gentle and rattling exacting yet generous fearless of her mother for instance whose irrationally hard and strict rule she has often defied yet reliant on any who will help her <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> with her little piquant face engaging prattle and winning ways is made to be a pet and her father s pet she accordingly is It is odd that the doll should resemble her mother feature by feature as <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> resembles her father and yet the physiognomy how different Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> if a magic mirror were now held before you and if therein were shown you your two daughters as they will be twenty years from this night what would you think The magic mirror is here you shall learn their destinies and first that of your little life Jessy Do you know this place No you never saw it but you recognize the nature of these trees this foliage the cypress the willow the yew Stone crosses like these are not unfamiliar to you nor are these dim garlands of everlasting flowers Here is the place green sod and a gray marble headstone <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> sleeps below She lived through an April day much loved was she much loving She often in her brief life shed tears she had frequent sorrows she smiled between gladdening whatever saw her Her death was tranquil and happy in <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> s guardian arms for <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> had been her stay and defence through many trials The dying and the watching English girls were at that hour alone in a foreign country and the soil of that country gave <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> a grave Now behold <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> two years later The crosses and garlands looked strange but the hills and woods of this landscape look still stranger This indeed is far from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> remote must be the shores which wear that wild luxuriant aspect This is some virgin solitude Unknown birds flutter round the skirts of that forest no European river this on whose banks <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> sits thinking The little quiet <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> girl is a lonely emigrant in some region of the southern hemisphere Will she ever come back The three eldest of the family are all boys <PERSON>Matthew Mark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> They are seated together in that corner engaged in some game Observe their three heads much alike at a first glance at a second different at a third contrasted Dark haired dark eyed red cheeked are the whole trio small English features they all possess all own a blended resemblance to sire and mother and yet a distinctive physiognomy mark of a separate character belongs to each I shall not say much about <PERSON>Matthew the first</PERSON> born of the house though it is impossible to avoid gazing at him long and conjecturing what qualities that visage hides or indicates He is no plain looking boy that jet black hair white brow high coloured cheek those quick dark eyes are good points in their way How is it that look as long as you will there is but one object in the room and that the most sinister to which <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> s face seems to bear an affinity and of which ever and anon it reminds you strangely the eruption of Vesuvius Flame and shadow seem the component parts of that lad s soul no daylight in it and no sunshine and no pure cool moonbeam ever shone there He has an English frame but apparently not an English mind you would say an Italian stiletto in a sheath of British workmanship He is crossed in the game look at his scowl Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> sees it and what does he say In a low voice he pleads <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> don t anger your brother And this is ever the tone adopted by both parents Theoretically they decry partiality no rights of primogeniture are to be allowed in that house but <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> is never to be vexed never to be opposed they avert provocation from him as assiduously as they would avert fire from a barrel of gunpowder Concede conciliate is their motto wherever he is concerned The republicans are fast making a tyrant of their own flesh and blood This the younger scions know and feel and at heart they all rebel against the injustice They cannot read their parents motives they only see the difference of treatment The dragon s teeth are already sown amongst Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s young olive branches discord will one day be the harvest <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> is a bonny looking boy the most regular featured of the family He is exceedingly calm his smile is shrewd he can say the driest most cutting things in the quietest of tones Despite his tranquillity a somewhat heavy brow speaks temper and reminds you that the smoothest waters are not always the safest Besides he is too still unmoved phlegmatic to be happy Life will never have much joy in it for Mark By the time he is five and twenty he will wonder why people ever laugh and think all fools who seem merry Poetry will not exist for Mark either in literature or in life its best effusions will sound to him mere rant and jargon Enthusiasm will be his aversion and contempt <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> will have no youth while he looks juvenile and blooming he will be already middle aged in mind His body is now fourteen years of age but his soul is already thirty <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the youngest of the three owns another nature Life may or may not be brief for him but it will certainly be brilliant He will pass through all its illusions half believe in them wholly enjoy them then outlive them That boy is not handsome not so handsome as either of his brothers He is plain there is a husk upon him a dry shell and he will wear it till he is near twenty then he will put it off About that period he will make himself handsome He will wear uncouth manners till that age perhaps homely garments but the chrysalis will retain the power of transfiguring itself into the butterfly and such transfiguration will in due season take place For a space he will be vain probably a downright puppy eager for pleasure and desirous of admiration athirst too for knowledge He will want all that the world can give him both of enjoyment and lore he will perhaps take deep draughts at each fount That thirst satisfied what next I know not <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> might be a remarkable man Whether he will or not the seer is powerless to predict on that subject there has been no open vision Take Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s family in the aggregate there is as much mental power in those six young heads as much originality as much activity and vigour of brain as divided amongst half a dozen commonplace broods would give to each rather more than an average amount of sense and capacity Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> knows this and is proud of his race <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> has such families here and there amongst her hills and wolds peculiar racy vigorous of good blood and strong brain turbulent somewhat in the pride of their strength and intractable in the force of their native powers wanting polish wanting consideration wanting docility but sound spirited and true bred as the eagle on the cliff or the steed in the steppe A low tap is heard at the parlour door the boys have been making such a noise over their game and little Jessy besides has been singing so sweet a Scotch song to her father who delights in Scotch and Italian songs and has taught his musical little daughter some of the best that the ring at the outer door was not observed Come in says <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> in that conscientiously constrained and solemnized voice of hers which ever modulates itself to a funereal dreariness of tone though the subject it is exercised upon be but to give orders for the making of a pudding in the kitchen to bid the boys hang up their caps in the hall or to call the girls to their sewing come in And in came <PERSON>Robert Moore Moore</PERSON> s habitual gravity as well as his abstemiousness for the case of spirit decanters is never ordered up when he pays an evening visit has so far recommended him to <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> that she has not yet made him the subject of private animadversions with her husband she has not yet found out that he is hampered by a secret intrigue which prevents him from marrying or that he is a wolf in sheep s clothing discoveries which she made at an early date after marriage concerning most of her husband s bachelor friends and excluded them from her board accordingly which part of her conduct indeed might be said to have its just and sensible as well as its harsh side Well is it you she says to Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> as he comes up to her and gives his hand What are you roving about at this time of night for You should be at home Can a single man be said to have a home madam he asks <PERSON>Pooh</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> who despises conventional smoothness quite as much as her husband does and practises it as little and whose plain speaking on all occasions is carried to a point calculated sometimes to awaken admiration but oftener alarm pooh you need not talk nonsense to me a single man can have a home if he likes Pray does not your sister make a home for you Not she joined in Mr <PERSON>Yorke Hortense</PERSON> is an honest lass But when I was <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s age I had five or six sisters all as decent and proper as she is but you see <PERSON>Hesther</PERSON> for all that it did not hinder me from looking out for a wife And sorely he has repented marrying me added <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> who liked occasionally to crack a dry jest against matrimony even though it should be at her own expense He has repented it in sackcloth and ashes <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> as you may well believe when you see his punishment here she pointed to her children Who would burden themselves with such a set of great rough lads as those if they could help it It is not only bringing them into the world though that is bad enough but they are all to feed to clothe to rear to settle in life <PERSON>Young</PERSON> sir when you feel tempted to marry think of our four sons and two daughters and look twice before you leap I am not tempted now at any rate I think these are not times for marrying or giving in marriage A lugubrious sentiment of this sort was sure to obtain <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> s approbation She nodded and groaned acquiescence but in a minute she said I make little account of the wisdom of a Solomon of your age it will be upset by the first fancy that crosses you Meantime sit down sir You can talk I suppose as well sitting as standing This was her way of inviting her guest to take a chair He had no sooner obeyed her than little <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> jumped from her father s knee and ran into Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s arms which were very promptly held out to receive her You talk of marrying him said she to her mother quite indignantly as she was lifted lightly to his knee and he is married now or as good He promised that I should be his wife last summer the first time he saw me in my new white frock and blue sash Didn t he father These children were not accustomed to say papa and mamma their mother would allow no such namby pamby Ay my little lassie he promised I ll bear witness But make him say it over again now <PERSON>Jessy Such</PERSON> as he are only false loons He is not false He is too bonny to be false said <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> looking up to her tall sweetheart with the fullest confidence in his faith <PERSON>Bonny</PERSON> cried Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> That s the reason that he should be and proof that he is a scoundrel But he looks too sorrowful to be false here interposed a quiet voice from behind the father s chair If he was always laughing I should think he forgot promises soon but Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> never laughs Your sentimental buck is the greatest cheat of all <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> remarked Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> He s not sentimental said <PERSON>Rose Mr Moore</PERSON> turned to her with a little surprise smiling at the same time How do you know I am not sentimental Rose Because I heard a lady say you were not Voil qui devient int ressant exclaimed Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> hitching his chair nearer the fire A lady That has quite a romantic twang We must guess who it is Rosy whisper the name low to your father <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t let _him_ hear <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> don t be too forward to talk here interrupted <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> in her usual kill joy fashion nor <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> either It becomes all children especially girls to be silent in the presence of their elders Why have we tongues then asked <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> pertly while <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> only looked at her mother with an expression that seemed to say she should take that maxim in and think it over at her leisure After two minutes grave deliberation she asked And why especially girls mother Firstly because I say so and secondly because discretion and reserve are a girl s best wisdom My dear madam observed <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> what you say is excellent it reminds me indeed of my dear sister s observations but really it is not applicable to these little ones Let <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> talk to me freely or my chief pleasure in coming here is gone I like their prattle it does me good Does it not asked <PERSON>Jessy More</PERSON> good than if the rough lads came round you You call them rough mother yourself Yes mignonne a thousand times more good I have rough lads enough about me all day long poulet There are plenty of people continued she who take notice of the boys All my uncles and aunts seem to think their nephews better than their nieces and when gentlemen come here to dine it is always <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> that are talked to and never <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> and me Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is _our_ friend and we ll keep him But mind <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> he s not so much your friend as he is mine He is my _particular acquaintance_ remember that And she held up her small hand with an admonitory gesture <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> was quite accustomed to be admonished by that small hand Her will daily bent itself to that of the impetuous little Jessy She was guided overruled by <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> in a thousand things On all occasions of show and pleasure <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> took the lead and <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> fell quietly into the background whereas when the disagreeables of life its work and privations were in question <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> instinctively took upon her in addition to her own share what she could of her sister s <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> had already settled it in her mind that she when she was old enough was to be married <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> she decided must be an old maid to live with her look after her children keep her house This state of things is not uncommon between two sisters where one is plain and the other pretty but in this case if there _was_ a difference in external appearance <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> had the advantage her face was more regular featured than that of the piquant little <PERSON>Jessy Jessy</PERSON> however was destined to possess along with sprightly intelligence and vivacious feeling the gift of fascination the power to charm when where and whom she would <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> was to have a fine generous soul a noble intellect profoundly cultivated a heart as true as steel but the manner to attract was not to be hers Now <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> tell me the name of this lady who denied that I was sentimental urged Mr <PERSON>Moore Rose</PERSON> had no idea of tantalization or she would have held him a while in doubt She answered briefly I can t I don t know her name Describe her to me What was she like Where did you see her When <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> and I went to spend the day at <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> and <PERSON>Susan Pearson</PERSON> who were just come home from school there was a party at <ORGANIZATION>Mrs Pearson</ORGANIZATION> s and some grown up ladies were sitting in a corner of the drawing room talking about you Did you know none of them <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harriet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dora</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Sykes</PERSON> Good Were they abusing me Rosy Some of them were They called you a misanthrope I remember the word I looked for it in the dictionary when I came home It means a man hater What besides <PERSON>Hannah Sykes</PERSON> said you were a solemn puppy Better cried Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> laughing Oh excellent <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> that s the one with the red hair a fine girl but half witted She has wit enough for me it appears said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> A solemn puppy indeed Well Rose go on Miss <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> said she believed there was a good deal of affectation about you and that with your dark hair and pale face you looked to her like some sort of a sentimental noodle Again Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> laughed <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> even joined in this time You see in what esteem you are held behind your back said she yet I believe _that_ Miss <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> would like to catch you She set her cap at you when you first came into the country old as she is And who contradicted her Rosy inquired <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> A lady whom I don t know because she never visits here though I see her every Sunday at church She sits in the pew near the pulpit I generally look at her instead of looking at my prayer book for she is like a picture in our dining room that woman with the dove in her hand at least she has eyes like it and a nose too a straight nose that makes all her face look somehow what I call clear And you don t know her exclaimed <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> in a tone of exceeding surprise That s so like Rose Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I often wonder in what sort of a world my sister lives I am sure she does not live all her time in this One is continually finding out that she is quite ignorant of some little matter which everybody else knows To think of her going solemnly to church every Sunday and looking all service time at one particular person and never so much as asking that person s name She means <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> the rector s niece I remember all about it Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was quite angry with <PERSON>Anne Pearson She</PERSON> said <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> is neither affected nor sentimental you mistake his character utterly or rather not one of you here knows anything about it Now shall I tell you what she is like I can tell what people are like and how they are dressed better than Rose can Let us hear She is nice she is fair she has a pretty white slender throat she has long curls not stiff ones they hang loose and soft their colour is brown but not dark she speaks quietly with a clear tone she never makes a bustle in moving she often wears a gray silk dress she is neat all over her gowns and her shoes and her gloves always fit her She is what I call a lady and when I am as tall as she is I mean to be like her Shall I suit you if I am Will you really marry me <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> stroked <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> s hair For a minute he seemed as if he would draw her nearer to him but instead he put her a little farther off Oh you won t have me You push me away Why <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> you care nothing about me You never come to see me now at the Hollow Because you don t ask me Hereupon Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> gave both the little girls an invitation to pay him a visit next day promising that as he was going to <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> in the morning he would buy them each a present of what nature he would not then declare but they must come and see <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> was about to reply when one of the boys unexpectedly broke in I know that Miss Helstone you have all been palavering about She s an ugly girl I hate her I hate all womenites I wonder what they were made for <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said his father for <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> it was The lad only answered by turning his cynical young face half arch half truculent towards the paternal chair <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> my lad thou rt a swaggering whelp now thou wilt some day be an outrageous puppy But stick to those sentiments of thine See I ll write down the words now i my pocket book The senior took out a morocco covered book and deliberately wrote therein Ten years hence <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> if thou and I be both alive at that day I ll remind thee of that speech I ll say the same then I mean always to hate women They re such dolls they do nothing but dress themselves finely and go swimming about to be admired I ll never marry I ll be a bachelor Stick to it stick to it Hesther addressing his wife I was like him when I was his age a regular misogamist and behold by the time I was three and twenty being then a tourist in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and the Lord knows where I curled my hair every night before I went to bed and wore a ring i my ear and would have worn one i my nose if it had been the fashion and all that I might make myself pleasing and charming to the ladies <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> will do the like Will I Never I ve more sense What a guy you were father As to dressing I make this vow I ll never dress more finely than as you see me at present Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I m clad in blue cloth from top to toe and they laugh at me and call me sailor at the grammar school I laugh louder at them and say they are all magpies and parrots with their coats one colour and their waistcoats another and their trousers a third I ll always wear blue cloth and nothing but blue cloth It is beneath a human being s dignity to dress himself in parti coloured garments Ten years hence <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> no tailor s shop will have choice of colours varied enough for thy exacting taste no perfumer s stores essences exquisite enough for thy fastidious senses <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> looked disdain but vouchsafed no further reply Meantime <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> who for some minutes had been rummaging amongst a pile of books on a side table took the word He spoke in a peculiarly slow quiet voice and with an expression of still irony in his face not easy to describe Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said he you think perhaps it was a compliment on Miss <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> s part to say you were not sentimental I thought you appeared confused when my sisters told you the words as if you felt flattered You turned red just like a certain vain little lad at our school who always thinks proper to blush when he gets a rise in the class For your benefit Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I ve been looking up the word sentimental in the dictionary and I find it to mean tinctured with sentiment On examining further sentiment is explained to be thought idea notion A sentimental man then is one who has thoughts ideas notions an unsentimental man is one destitute of thought idea or notion And <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> stopped He did not smile he did not look round for admiration He had said his say and was silent Ma foi mon ami observed Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> ce sont vraiment des enfants terribles que les v tres Rose who had been listening attentively to <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> s speech replied to him There are different kinds of thoughts ideas and notions said she good and bad Sentimental must refer to the bad or Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> must have taken it in that sense for she was not blaming Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> she was defending him That s my kind little advocate said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> taking <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> s hand She was defending him repeated <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> as I should have done had I been in her place for the other ladies seemed to speak spitefully Ladies always do speak spitefully observed <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> It is the nature of womenites to be spiteful <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> now for the first time opened his lips What a fool <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> is to be always gabbling about what he does not understand It is my privilege as a freeman to gabble on whatever subject I like responded Martin You use it or rather abuse it to such an extent rejoined the elder brother that you prove you ought to have been a slave A slave a slave That to a <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and from a Yorke This fellow he added standing up at the table and pointing across it to <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> this fellow forgets what every cottier in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> knows that all born of our house have that arched instep under which water can flow proof that there has not been a slave of the blood for three hundred years Mountebank said <PERSON>Matthew Lads</PERSON> be silent exclaimed Mr <PERSON>Yorke Martin</PERSON> you are a mischief maker There would have been no disturbance but for you Indeed Is that correct Did I begin or did <PERSON>Matthew Had</PERSON> I spoken to him when he accused me of gabbling like a fool A presumptuous fool repeated <PERSON>Matthew Here Mrs Yorke</PERSON> commenced rocking herself rather a portentous movement with her as it was occasionally followed especially when <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> was worsted in a conflict by a fit of hysterics I don t see why I should bear insolence from <PERSON>Matthew Yorke</PERSON> or what right he has to use bad language to me observed <PERSON>Martin He</PERSON> has no right my lad but forgive your brother until seventy and seven times said Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> soothingly Always alike and theory and practice always adverse murmured <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> as he turned to leave the room Where art thou going my son asked the father Somewhere where I shall be safe from insult if in this house I can find any such place <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> laughed very insolently <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> threw a strange look at him and trembled through all his slight lad s frame but he restrained himself I suppose there is no objection to my withdrawing he inquired No Go my lad but remember not to bear malice <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> went and <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> sent another insolent laugh after him <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> lifting her fair head from <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s shoulder against which for a moment it had been resting said as she directed a steady gaze to <PERSON>Matthew Martin</PERSON> is grieved and you are glad but I would rather be <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> than you I dislike your nature Here Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> by way of averting or at least escaping a scene which a sob from <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> warned him was likely to come on rose and putting <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> off his knee he kissed her and <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> reminding them at the same time to be sure and come to the Hollow in good time to morrow afternoon then having taken leave of his hostess he said to Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> May I speak a word with you and was followed by him from the room Their brief conference took place in the hall Have you employment for a good workman asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> A nonsense question in these times when you know that every master has many good workmen to whom he cannot give full employment You must oblige me by taking on this man if possible My lad I can take on no more hands to oblige all <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> It does not signify I must find him a place somewhere Who is he <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> I know <PERSON>William</PERSON> A right down honest man is <PERSON>William He</PERSON> has been out of work three months He has a large family We are sure they cannot live without wages He was one of the deputation of cloth dressers who came to me this morning to complain and threaten <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not threaten He only asked me to give them rather more time to make my changes more slowly You know I cannot do that straitened on all sides as I am I have nothing for it but to push on I thought it would be idle to palaver long with them I sent them away after arresting a rascal amongst them whom I hope to transport a fellow who preaches at the chapel yonder sometimes Not Moses Barraclough Yes Ah you ve arrested him Good Then out of a scoundrel you re going to make a martyr You ve done a wise thing I ve done a right thing Well the short and the long of it is I m determined to get <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> a place and I reckon on you to give him one This is cool however exclaimed Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> What right have you to reckon on me to provide for your dismissed workmen What do I know about your Farrens and your <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> I ve heard he s an honest man but am I to support all the honest men in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> You may say that would be no great charge to undertake but great or little I ll none of it Come Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> what can you find for him to do _I_ find You ll make me use language I m not accustomed to use I wish you would go home Here is the door set off <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> sat down on one of the hall chairs You can t give him work in your mill good but you have land Find him some occupation on your land Mr <PERSON>Yorke Bob</PERSON> I thought you cared nothing about our _lourdauds de paysans_ I don t understand this change I do The fellow spoke to me nothing but truth and sense I answered him just as roughly as I did the rest who jabbered mere gibberish I couldn t make distinctions there and then His appearance told what he had gone through lately clearer than his words but where is the use of explaining Let him have work Let him have it yourself If you are so very much in earnest strain a point If there was a point left in my affairs to strain I would strain it till it cracked again but I received letters this morning which showed me pretty clearly where I stand and it is not far off the end of the plank My foreign market at any rate is gorged If there is no change if there dawns no prospect of peace if the Orders in Council are not at least suspended so as to open our way in the West I do not know where I am to turn I see no more light than if I were sealed in a rock so that for me to pretend to offer a man a livelihood would be to do a dishonest thing Come let us take a turn on the front It is a starlight night said Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> They passed out closing the front door after them and side by side paced the frost white pavement to and fro Settle about <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> at once urged Mr Moore You have large fruit gardens at <ORGANIZATION>Yorke Mills</ORGANIZATION> He is a good gardener Give him work there Well so be it I ll send for him to morrow and we ll see And now my lad you re concerned about the condition of your affairs Yes a second failure which I may delay but which at this moment I see no way finally to avert would blight the name of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> completely and you are aware I had fine intentions of paying off every debt and re establishing the old firm on its former basis You want capital that s all you want Yes but you might as well say that breath is all a dead man wants to live I know I know capital is not to be had for the asking and if you were a married man and had a family like me I should think your case pretty nigh desperate but the young and unencumbered have chances peculiar to themselves I hear gossip now and then about your being on the eve of marriage with this miss and that but I suppose it is none of it true You may well suppose that I think I am not in a position to be dreaming of marriage Marriage I cannot bear the word it sounds so silly and utopian I have settled it decidedly that marriage and love are superfluities intended only for the rich who live at ease and have no need to take thought for the morrow or desperations the last and reckless joy of the deeply wretched who never hope to rise out of the slough of their utter poverty I should not think so if I were circumstanced as you are I should think I could very likely get a wife with a few thousands who would suit both me and my affairs I wonder where Would you try if you had a chance I don t know It depends on in short it depends on many things Would you take an old woman I d rather break stones on the road So would I Would you take an ugly one Bah I hate ugliness and delight in beauty My eyes and heart <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> take pleasure in a sweet young fair face as they are repelled by a grim rugged meagre one Soft delicate lines and hues please harsh ones prejudice me I won t have an ugly wife Not if she were rich Not if she were dressed in gems I could not love I could not fancy I could not endure her My taste must have satisfaction or disgust would break out in despotism or worse freeze to utter iciness What <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> if you married an honest good natured and wealthy lass though a little hard favoured couldn t you put up with the high cheek bones the rather wide mouth and reddish hair I ll never try I tell you Grace at least I _will_ have and youth and symmetry yes and what I call beauty And poverty and a nursery full of bairns you can neither clothe nor feed and very soon an anxious faded mother and then bankruptcy discredit a life long struggle Let me alone <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> If you are romantic <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and especially if you are already in love it is of no use talking I am not romantic I am stripped of romance as bare as the white tenters in that field are of cloth Always use such figures of speech lad I can understand them And there is no love affair to disturb your judgment I thought I had said enough on that subject before Love for me Stuff Well then if you are sound both in heart and head there is no reason why you should not profit by a good chance if it offers therefore wait and see You are quite oracular <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> I think I am a bit i that line I promise ye naught and I advise ye naught but I bid ye keep your heart up and be guided by circumstances My namesake the physician s almanac could not speak more guardedly In the meantime I care naught about ye <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> ye are nothing akin to me or mine and whether ye lose or find a fortune it maks no difference to me Go home now It has stricken ten Miss <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> will be wondering where ye are CHAPTER X OLD MAIDS Time wore on and spring matured The surface of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> began to look pleasant her fields grew green her hills fresh her gardens blooming but at heart she was no better Still her poor were wretched still their employers were harassed <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in some of its branches seemed threatened with paralysis for the war continued <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> s blood was shed and her wealth lavished all it seemed to attain most inadequate ends Some tidings there were indeed occasionally of successes in the <LOCATION>Peninsula</LOCATION> but these came in slowly long intervals occurred between in which no note was heard but the insolent self felicitations of <PERSON>Bonaparte</PERSON> on his continued triumphs Those who suffered from the results of the war felt this tedious and as they thought hopeless struggle against what their fears or their interests taught them to regard as an invincible power most insufferable They demanded peace on any terms Men like <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and there were thousands whom the war placed where it placed them shuddering on the verge of bankruptcy insisted on peace with the energy of desperation They held meetings they made speeches they got up petitions to extort this boon on what terms it was made they cared not All men taken singly are more or less selfish and taken in bodies they are intensely so The British merchant is no exception to this rule the mercantile classes illustrate it strikingly These classes certainly think too exclusively of making money they are too oblivious of every national consideration but that of extending <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> s that is their own commerce Chivalrous feeling disinterestedness pride in honour is too dead in their hearts A land ruled by them alone would too often make ignominious submission not at all from the motives <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> teaches but rather from those Mammon instils During the late war the tradesmen of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> would have endured buffets from the French on the right cheek and on the left their cloak they would have given to <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> and then have politely offered him their coat also nor would they have withheld their waistcoat if urged they would have prayed permission only to retain their one other garment for the sake of the purse in its pocket Not one spark of spirit not one symptom of resistance would they have shown till the hand of the Corsican bandit had grasped that beloved purse _then_ perhaps transfigured at once into British bulldogs they would have sprung at the robber s throat and there they would have fastened and there hung inveterate insatiable till the treasure had been restored Tradesmen when they speak against war always profess to hate it because it is a bloody and barbarous proceeding You would think to hear them talk that they are peculiarly civilized especially gentle and kindly of disposition to their fellow men This is not the case Many of them are extremely narrow and cold hearted have no good feeling for any class but their own are distant even hostile to all others call them useless seem to question their right to exist seem to grudge them the very air they breathe and to think the circumstance of their eating drinking and living in decent houses quite unjustifiable They do not know what others do in the way of helping pleasing or teaching their race they will not trouble themselves to inquire Whoever is not in trade is accused of eating the bread of idleness of passing a useless existence Long may it be ere <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> really becomes a nation of shop keepers We have already said that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was no self sacrificing patriot and we have also explained what circumstances rendered him specially prone to confine his attention and efforts to the furtherance of his individual interest accordingly when he felt himself urged a second time to the brink of ruin none struggled harder than he against the influences which would have thrust him over What he _could_ do towards stirring agitation in the north against the war he did and he instigated others whose money and connections gave them more power than he possessed Sometimes by flashes he felt there was little reason in the demands his party made on Government When he heard of all <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> threatened by <PERSON>Bonaparte</PERSON> and of all <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> arming to resist him when he saw <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> menaced and beheld <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> rising incensed and stern to defend her frozen soil her wild provinces of serfs her dark native despotism from the tread the yoke the tyranny of a foreign victor he knew that <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> a free realm could not _then_ depute her sons to make concessions and propose terms to the unjust grasping French leader When news came from time to time of the movements of that MAN then representing <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Peninsula</LOCATION> of his advance from success to success that advance so deliberate but so unswerving so circumspect but so certain so unhasting but so unresting when he read Lord <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> s own dispatches in the columns of the newspapers documents written by modesty to the dictation of truth <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> confessed at heart that a power was with the troops of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> of that vigilant enduring genuine unostentatious sort which must win victory to the side it led in the end In the end But that end he thought was yet far off and meantime he <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> as an individual would be crushed his hopes ground to dust It was himself he had to care for his hopes he had to pursue and he would fulfil his destiny He fulfilled it so vigorously that ere long he came to a decisive rupture with his old Tory friend the rector They quarrelled at a public meeting and afterwards exchanged some pungent letters in the newspapers Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> denounced <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> as a <ORGANIZATION>Jacobin</ORGANIZATION> ceased to see him would not even speak to him when they met He intimated also to his niece very distinctly that her communications with Hollow s Cottage must for the present cease she must give up taking French lessons The language he observed was a bad and frivolous one at the best and most of the works it boasted were bad and frivolous highly injurious in their tendency to weak female minds He wondered he remarked parenthetically what noodle first made it the fashion to teach women French Nothing was more improper for them It was like feeding a rickety child on chalk and water gruel <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> must give it up and give up her cousins too They were dangerous people Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> quite expected opposition to this order he expected tears Seldom did he trouble himself about <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s movements but a vague idea possessed him that she was fond of going to <ORGANIZATION>Hollow s Cottage</ORGANIZATION> also he suspected that she liked <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> s occasional presence at the rectory The Cossack had perceived that whereas if <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> stepped in of an evening to make himself sociable and charming by pinching the ears of an aged black cat which usually shared with Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s feet the accommodation of her footstool or by borrowing a fowling piece and banging away at a tool shed door in the garden while enough of daylight remained to show that conspicuous mark keeping the passage and sitting room doors meantime uncomfortably open for the convenience of running in and out to announce his failures and successes with noisy _brusquerie_ he had observed that under such entertaining circumstances <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had a trick of disappearing tripping noiselessly upstairs and remaining invisible till called down to supper On the other hand when <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> was the guest though he elicited no vivacities from the cat did nothing to it indeed beyond occasionally coaxing it from the stool to his knee and there letting it purr climb to his shoulder and rub its head against his cheek though there was no ear splitting cracking off of firearms no diffusion of sulphurous gunpowder perfume no noise no boasting during his stay that still <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sat in the room and seemed to find wondrous content in the stitching of Jew basket pin cushions and the knitting of missionary basket socks She was very quiet and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> paid her little attention scarcely ever addressing his discourse to her but Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> not being one of those elderly gentlemen who are easily blinded on the contrary finding himself on all occasions extremely wide awake had watched them when they bade each other good night He had just seen their eyes meet once only once Some natures would have taken pleasure in the glance then surprised because there was no harm and some delight in it It was by no means a glance of mutual intelligence for mutual love secrets existed not between them There was nothing then of craft and concealment to offend only Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s eyes looking into <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s felt they were clear and gentle and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s eyes encountering Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s confessed they were manly and searching Each acknowledged the charm in his or her own way <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> smiled slightly and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> coloured as slightly Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> could on the spot have rated them both They annoyed him Why Impossible to say If you had asked him what <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> merited at that moment he would have said a horsewhip if you had inquired into <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s deserts he would have adjudged her a box on the ear if you had further demanded the reason of such chastisements he would have stormed against flirtation and love making and vowed he would have no such folly going on under his roof These private considerations combined with political reasons fixed his resolution of separating the cousins He announced his will to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> one evening as she was sitting at work near the drawing room window Her face was turned towards him and the light fell full upon it It had struck him a few minutes before that she was looking paler and quieter than she used to look It had not escaped him either that <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> s name had never for some three weeks past dropped from her lips nor during the same space of time had that personage made his appearance at the rectory Some suspicion of clandestine meetings haunted his mind Having but an indifferent opinion of women he always suspected them He thought they needed constant watching It was in a tone dryly significant he desired her to cease her daily visits to the Hollow He expected a start a look of depreciation The start he saw but it was a very slight one no look whatever was directed to him Do you hear me he asked Yes uncle Of course you mean to attend to what I say Yes certainly And there must be no letter scribbling to your cousin <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> no intercourse whatever I do not approve of the principles of the family They are Jacobinical Very well said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> quietly She acquiesced then There was no vexed flushing of the face no gathering tears the shadowy thoughtfulness which had covered her features ere Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> spoke remained undisturbed she was obedient Yes perfectly because the mandate coincided with her own previous judgment because it was now become pain to her to go to Hollow s Cottage nothing met her there but disappointment <PERSON>Hope</PERSON> and love had quitted that little tenement for <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> seemed to have deserted its precincts Whenever she asked after him which she very seldom did since the mere utterance of his name made her face grow hot the answer was he was from home or he was quite taken up with business <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> feared he was killing himself by application He scarcely ever took a meal in the house he lived in the counting house At church only <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had the chance of seeing him and there she rarely looked at him It was both too much pain and too much pleasure to look it excited too much emotion and that it was all wasted emotion she had learned well to comprehend Once on a dark wet Sunday when there were few people at church and when especially certain ladies were absent of whose observant faculties and tomahawk tongues <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> stood in awe she had allowed her eye to seek <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s pew and to rest awhile on its occupant He was there alone <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> had been kept at home by prudent considerations relative to the rain and a new spring _chapeau_ During the sermon he sat with folded arms and eyes cast down looking very sad and abstracted When depressed the very hue of his face seemed more dusk than when he smiled and to day cheek and forehead wore their most tintless and sober olive By instinct <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knew as she examined that clouded countenance that his thoughts were running in no familiar or kindly channel that they were far away not merely from her but from all which she could comprehend or in which she could sympathize Nothing that they had ever talked of together was now in his mind he was wrapt from her by interests and responsibilities in which it was deemed such as she could have no part <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> meditated in her own way on the subject speculated on his feelings on his life on his fears on his fate mused over the mystery of business tried to comprehend more about it than had ever been told her to understand its perplexities liabilities duties exactions endeavoured to realize the state of mind of a man of business to enter into it feel what he would feel aspire to what he would aspire Her earnest wish was to see things as they were and not to be romantic By dint of effort she contrived to get a glimpse of the light of truth here and there and hoped that scant ray might suffice to guide her Different indeed she concluded is <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s mental condition to mine I think only of him he has no room no leisure to think of me The feeling called love is and has been for two years the predominant emotion of my heart always there always awake always astir Quite other feelings absorb his reflections and govern his faculties He is rising now going to leave the church for service is over Will he turn his head towards this pew No not once He has not one look for me That is hard A kind glance would have made me happy till to morrow I have not got it he would not give it he is gone Strange that grief should now almost choke me because another human being s eye has failed to greet mine That Sunday evening Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> coming as usual to pass it with his rector <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> withdrew after tea to her chamber <ORGANIZATION>Fanny</ORGANIZATION> knowing her habits had lit her a cheerful little fire as the weather was so gusty and chill Closeted there silent and solitary what could she do but think She noiselessly paced to and fro the carpeted floor her head drooped her hands folded It was irksome to sit the current of reflection ran rapidly through her mind to night she was mutely excited Mute was the room mute the house The double door of the study muffled the voices of the gentlemen The servants were quiet in the kitchen engaged with books their young mistress had lent them books which she had told them were fit for Sunday reading And she herself had another of the same sort open on the table but she could not read it Its theology was incomprehensible to her and her own mind was too busy teeming wandering to listen to the language of another mind Then too her imagination was full of pictures images of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> scenes where he and she had been together winter fireside sketches a glowing landscape of a hot summer afternoon passed with him in the bosom of Nunnely Wood divine vignettes of mild spring or mellow autumn moments when she had sat at his side in Hollow s Copse listening to the call of the May cuckoo or sharing the September treasure of nuts and ripe blackberries a wild dessert which it was her morning s pleasure to collect in a little basket and cover with green leaves and fresh blossoms and her afternoon s delight to administer to <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> berry by berry and nut by nut like a bird feeding its fledgling <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s features and form were with her the sound of his voice was quite distinct in her ear his few caresses seemed renewed But these joys being hollow were ere long crushed in The pictures faded the voice failed the visionary clasp melted chill from her hand and where the warm seal of lips had made impress on her forehead it felt now as if a sleety rain drop had fallen She returned from an enchanted region to the real world for Nunnely Wood in June she saw her narrow chamber for the songs of birds in alleys she heard the rain on her casement for the sigh of the south wind came the sob of the mournful east and for <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s manly companionship she had the thin illusion of her own dim shadow on the wall Turning from the pale phantom which reflected herself in its outline and her reverie in the drooped attitude of its dim head and colourless tresses she sat down inaction would suit the frame of mind into which she was now declining she said to herself I have to live perhaps till seventy years As far as I know I have good health half a century of existence may lie before me How am I to occupy it What am I to do to fill the interval of time which spreads between me and the grave She reflected I shall not be married it appears she continued I suppose as <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> does not care for me I shall never have a husband to love nor little children to take care of Till lately I had reckoned securely on the duties and affections of wife and mother to occupy my existence I considered somehow as a matter of course that I was growing up to the ordinary destiny and never troubled myself to seek any other but now I perceive plainly I may have been mistaken Probably I shall be an old maid I shall live to see <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> married to some one else some rich lady I shall never marry What was I created for I wonder Where is my place in the world She mused again Ah I see she pursued presently that is the question which most old maids are puzzled to solve Other people solve it for them by saying Your place is to do good to others to be helpful whenever help is wanted That is right in some measure and a very convenient doctrine for the people who hold it but I perceive that certain sets of human beings are very apt to maintain that other sets should give up their lives to them and their service and then they requite them by praise they call them devoted and virtuous Is this enough Is it to live Is there not a terrible hollowness mockery want craving in that existence which is given away to others for want of something of your own to bestow it on I suspect there is Does virtue lie in abnegation of self I do not believe it Undue humility makes tyranny weak concession creates selfishness The Romish religion especially teaches renunciation of self submission to others and nowhere are found so many grasping tyrants as in the ranks of the Romish priesthood Each human being has his share of rights I suspect it would conduce to the happiness and welfare of all if each knew his allotment and held to it as tenaciously as the martyr to his creed Queer thoughts these that surge in my mind Are they right thoughts I am not certain Well life is short at the best Seventy years they say pass like a vapour like a dream when one awaketh and every path trod by human feet terminates in one bourne the grave the little chink in the surface of this great globe the furrow where the mighty husbandman with the scythe deposits the seed he has shaken from the ripe stem and there it falls decays and thence it springs again when the world has rolled round a few times more So much for the body The soul meantime wings its long flight upward folds its wings on the brink of the sea of fire and glass and gazing down through the burning clearness finds there mirrored the vision of the Christian s triple Godhead the sovereign Father the mediating Son the Creator Spirit Such words at least have been chosen to express what is inexpressible to describe what baffles description The soul s real hereafter who shall guess Her fire was decayed to its last cinder <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> had departed and now the study bell rang for prayers The next day <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had to spend altogether alone her uncle being gone to dine with his friend Dr <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> vicar of Whinbury The whole time she was talking inwardly in the same strain looking forwards asking what she was to do with life <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> as she passed in and out of the room occasionally intent on housemaid errands perceived that her young mistress sat very still She was always in the same place always bent industriously over a piece of work She did not lift her head to speak to <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> as her custom was and when the latter remarked that the day was fine and she ought to take a walk she only said It is cold You are very diligent at that sewing Miss <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> continued the girl approaching her little table I am tired of it Fanny Then why do you go on with it Put it down Read or do something to amuse you It is solitary in this house <PERSON>Fanny Don</PERSON> t you think so I don t find it so miss Me and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> are company for one another but you are quite too still You should visit more Now be persuaded go upstairs and dress yourself smart and go and take tea in a friendly way with Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> or Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> I am certain either of those ladies would be delighted to see you But their houses are dismal they are both old maids I am certain old maids are a very unhappy race Not they miss They can t be unhappy they take such care of themselves They are all selfish Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> is not selfish Fanny She is always doing good How devotedly kind she was to her step mother as long as the old lady lived and now when she is quite alone in the world without brother or sister or any one to care for her how charitable she is to the poor as far as her means permit Still nobody thinks much of her or has pleasure in going to see her and how gentlemen always sneer at her They shouldn t miss I believe she is a good woman But gentlemen think only of ladies looks I ll go and see her exclaimed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> starting up and if she asks me to stay to tea I ll stay How wrong it is to neglect people because they are not pretty and young and merry And I will certainly call to see Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> too She may not be amiable but what has made her unamiable What has life been to her Fanny helped Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> to put away her work and afterwards assisted her to dress _You_ ll not be an old maid Miss <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> she said as she tied the sash of her brown silk frock having previously smoothed her soft full and shining curls there are no signs of an old maid about you <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> looked at the little mirror before her and she thought there were some signs She could see that she was altered within the last month that the hues of her complexion were paler her eyes changed a wan shade seemed to circle them her countenance was dejected she was not in short so pretty or so fresh as she used to be She distantly hinted this to <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> from whom she got no direct answer only a remark that people did vary in their looks but that at her age a little falling away signified nothing she would soon come round again and be plumper and rosier than ever Having given this assurance <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> showed singular zeal in wrapping her up in warm shawls and handkerchiefs till <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> nearly smothered with the weight was fain to resist further additions She paid her visits first to Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> for this was the most difficult point Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> was certainly not quite a lovable person Till now <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had always unhesitatingly declared she disliked her and more than once she had joined her cousin <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> in laughing at some of her peculiarities <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was not habitually given to sarcasm especially on anything humbler or weaker than himself but he had once or twice happened to be in the room when Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> had made a call on his sister and after listening to her conversation and viewing her features for a time he had gone out into the garden where his little cousin was tending some of his favourite flowers and while standing near and watching her he had amused himself with comparing fair youth delicate and attractive with shrivelled eld livid and loveless and in jestingly repeating to a smiling girl the vinegar discourse of a cankered old maid Once on such an occasion <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had said to him looking up from the luxuriant creeper she was binding to its frame Ah <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> you do not like old maids I too should come under the lash of your sarcasm if I were an old maid You an old maid he had replied A piquant notion suggested by lips of that tint and form I can fancy you though at forty quietly dressed pale and sunk but still with that straight nose white forehead and those soft eyes I suppose too you will keep your voice which has another timbre than that hard deep organ of Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> s Courage Cary Even at fifty you will not be repulsive Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> did not make herself or tune her voice <PERSON>Robert Nature</PERSON> made her in the mood in which she makes her briars and thorns whereas for the creation of some women she reserves the May morning hours when with light and dew she wooes the primrose from the turf and the lily from the wood moss Ushered into Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> s little parlour <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> found her as she always found her surrounded by perfect neatness cleanliness and comfort after all is it not a virtue in old maids that solitude rarely makes them negligent or disorderly no dust on her polished furniture none on her carpet fresh flowers in the vase on her table a bright fire in the grate She herself sat primly and somewhat grimly tidy in a cushioned rocking chair her hands busied with some knitting This was her favourite work as it required the least exertion She scarcely rose as <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> entered To avoid excitement was one of Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> s aims in life She had been composing herself ever since she came down in the morning and had just attained a certain lethargic state of tranquillity when the visitor s knock at the door startled her and undid her day s work She was scarcely pleased therefore to see Miss Helstone She received her with reserve bade her be seated with austerity and when she got her placed opposite she fixed her with her eye This was no ordinary doom to be fixed with Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> s eye <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> had undergone it once and had never forgotten the circumstance He considered it quite equal to anything <PERSON>Medusa</PERSON> could do He professed to doubt whether since that infliction his flesh had been quite what it was before whether there was not something stony in its texture The gaze had had such an effect on him as to drive him promptly from the apartment and house it had even sent him straightway up to the rectory where he had appeared in <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s presence with a very queer face and amazed her by demanding a cousinly salute on the spot to rectify a damage that had been done him Certainly Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> had a formidable eye for one of the softer sex It was prominent and showed a great deal of the white and looked as steadily as unwinkingly at you as if it were a steel ball soldered in her head and when while looking she began to talk in an indescribably dry monotonous tone a tone without vibration or inflection you felt as if a graven image of some bad spirit were addressing you But it was all a figment of fancy a matter of surface Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> s goblin grimness scarcely went deeper than the angel sweetness of hundreds of beauties She was a perfectly honest conscientious woman who had performed duties in her day from whose severe anguish many a human Peri gazelle eyed silken tressed and silver tongued would have shrunk appalled She had passed alone through protracted scenes of suffering exercised rigid self denial made large sacrifices of time money health for those who had repaid her only by ingratitude and now her main almost her sole fault was that she was censorious Censorious she certainly was <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had not sat five minutes ere her hostess still keeping her under the spell of that dread and <PERSON>Gorgon</PERSON> gaze began flaying alive certain of the families in the neighbourhood She went to work at this business in a singularly cool deliberate manner like some surgeon practising with his scalpel on a lifeless subject She made few distinctions she allowed scarcely any one to be good she dissected impartially almost all her acquaintance If her auditress ventured now and then to put in a palliative word she set it aside with a certain disdain Still though thus pitiless in moral anatomy she was no scandal monger She never disseminated really malignant or dangerous reports It was not her heart so much as her temper that was wrong <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> made this discovery for the first time to day and moved thereby to regret divers unjust judgments she had more than once passed on the crabbed old maid she began to talk to her softly not in sympathizing words but with a sympathizing voice The loneliness of her condition struck her visitor in a new light as did also the character of her ugliness a bloodless pallor of complexion and deeply worn lines of feature The girl pitied the solitary and afflicted woman her looks told what she felt A sweet countenance is never so sweet as when the moved heart animates it with compassionate tenderness Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> seeing such a countenance raised to her was touched in her turn She acknowledged her sense of the interest thus unexpectedly shown in her who usually met with only coldness and ridicule by replying to her candidly Communicative on her own affairs she usually was not because no one cared to listen to her but to day she became so and her confidante shed tears as she heard her speak for she told of cruel slow wasting obstinate sufferings Well might she be corpse like well might she look grim and never smile well might she wish to avoid excitement to gain and retain composure <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when she knew all acknowledged that Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> was rather to be admired for fortitude than blamed for moroseness Reader when you behold an aspect for whose constant gloom and frown you cannot account whose unvarying cloud exasperates you by its apparent causelessness be sure that there is a canker somewhere and a canker not the less deeply corroding because concealed Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> felt that she was understood partly and wished to be understood further for however old plain humble desolate afflicted we may be so long as our hearts preserve the feeblest spark of life they preserve also shivering near that pale ember a starved ghostly longing for appreciation and affection To this extenuated spectre perhaps a crumb is not thrown once a year but when ahungered and athirst to famine when all humanity has forgotten the dying tenant of a decaying house Divine mercy remembers the mourner and a shower of manna falls for lips that earthly nutriment is to pass no more Biblical promises heard first in health but then unheeded come whispering to the couch of sickness it is felt that a pitying God watches what all mankind have forsaken The tender compassion of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> is recalled and relied on the faded eye gazing beyond time sees a home a friend a refuge in eternity Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> drawn on by the still attention of her listener proceeded to allude to circumstances in her past life She spoke like one who tells the truth simply and with a certain reserve she did not boast nor did she exaggerate <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> found that the old maid had been a most devoted daughter and sister an unwearied watcher by lingering deathbeds that to prolonged and unrelaxing attendance on the sick the malady that now poisoned her own life owed its origin that to one wretched relative she had been a support and succour in the depths of self earned degradation and that it was still her hand which kept him from utter destitution Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> stayed the whole evening omitting to pay her other intended visit and when she left <PERSON>Miss Mann</PERSON> it was with the determination to try in future to excuse her faults never again to make light of her peculiarities or to laugh at her plainness and above all things not to neglect her but to come once a week and to offer her from one human heart at least the homage of affection and respect She felt she could now sincerely give her a small tribute of each feeling <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> on her return told <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> she was very glad she had gone out as she felt much better for the visit The next day she failed not to seek Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> This lady was in narrower circumstances than Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> and her dwelling was more humble It was however if possible yet more exquisitely clean though the decayed gentlewoman could not afford to keep a servant but waited on herself and had only the occasional assistance of a little girl who lived in a cottage near Not only was Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> poorer but she was even plainer than the other old maid In her first youth she must have been ugly now at the age of fifty she was _very_ ugly At first sight all but peculiarly well disciplined minds were apt to turn from her with annoyance to conceive against her a prejudice simply on the ground of her unattractive look Then she was prim in dress and manner she looked spoke and moved the complete old maid Her welcome to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was formal even in its kindness for it was kind but Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> excused this She knew something of the benevolence of the heart which beat under that starched kerchief all the neighbourhood at least all the female neighbourhood knew something of it No one spoke against Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> except lively young gentlemen and inconsiderate old ones who declared her hideous <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was soon at home in that tiny parlour A kind hand took from her her shawl and bonnet and installed her in the most comfortable seat near the fire The young and the antiquated woman were presently deep in kindly conversation and soon <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> became aware of the power a most serene unselfish and benignant mind could exercise over those to whom it was developed She talked never of herself always of others Their faults she passed over Her theme was their wants which she sought to supply their sufferings which she longed to alleviate She was religious a professor of religion what some would call a saint and she referred to religion often in sanctioned phrase in phrase which those who possess a perception of the ridiculous without owning the power of exactly testing and truly judging character would certainly have esteemed a proper subject for satire a matter for mimicry and laughter They would have been hugely mistaken for their pains Sincerity is never ludicrous it is always respectable Whether truth be it religious or moral truth speak eloquently and in well chosen language or not its voice should be heard with reverence Let those who cannot nicely and with certainty discern the difference between the tones of hypocrisy and those of sincerity never presume to laugh at all lest they should have the miserable misfortune to laugh in the wrong place and commit impiety when they think they are achieving wit Not from Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s own lips did <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> hear of her good works but she knew much of them nevertheless Her beneficence was the familiar topic of the poor in Briarfield They were not works of almsgiving The old maid was too poor to give much though she straitened herself to privation that she might contribute her mite when needful They were the works of a Sister of Charity far more difficult to perform than those of a Lady Bountiful She would watch by any sick bed she seemed to fear no disease She would nurse the poorest whom none else would nurse She was serene humble kind and equable through everything For this goodness she got but little reward in this life Many of the poor became so accustomed to her services that they hardly thanked her for them The rich heard them mentioned with wonder but were silent from a sense of shame at the difference between her sacrifices and their own Many ladies however respected her deeply They could not help it One gentleman one only gave her his friendship and perfect confidence This was Mr Hall the vicar of Nunnely He said and said truly that her life came nearer the life of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> than that of any other human being he had ever met with You must not think reader that ill sketching Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s character I depict a figment of imagination No We seek the originals of such portraits in real life only Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> studied well the mind and heart now revealed to her She found no high intellect to admire the old maid was merely sensible but she discovered so much goodness so much usefulness so much mildness patience truth that she bent her own mind before Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s in reverence What was her love of nature what was her sense of beauty what were her more varied and fervent emotions what was her deeper power of thought what her wider capacity to comprehend compared to the practical excellence of this good woman Momently they seemed only beautiful forms of selfish delight mentally she trod them under foot It is true she still felt with pain that the life which made Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> happy could not make her happy Pure and active as it was in her heart she deemed it deeply dreary because it was so loveless to her ideas so forlorn Yet doubtless she reflected it needed only habit to make it practicable and agreeable to any one It was despicable she felt to pine sentimentally to cherish secret griefs vain memories to be inert to waste youth in aching languor to grow old doing nothing I will bestir myself was her resolution and try to be wise if I cannot be good She proceeded to make inquiry of Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> if she could help her in anything Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> glad of an assistant told her that she could and indicated some poor families in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> that it was desirable she should visit giving her likewise at her further request some work to do for certain poor women who had many children and who were unskilled in using the needle for themselves <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> went home laid her plans and took a resolve not to swerve from them She allotted a certain portion of her time for her various studies and a certain portion for doing anything Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> might direct her to do The remainder was to be spent in exercise not a moment was to be left for the indulgence of such fevered thoughts as had poisoned last Sunday evening To do her justice she executed her plans conscientiously perseveringly It was very hard work at first it was even hard work to the end but it helped her to stem and keep down anguish it forced her to be employed it forbade her to brood and gleams of satisfaction chequered her gray life here and there when she found she had done good imparted pleasure or allayed suffering Yet I must speak truth These efforts brought her neither health of body nor continued peace of mind With them all she wasted grew more joyless and more wan with them all her memory kept harping on the name of <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> an elegy over the past still rung constantly in her ear a funereal inward cry haunted and harassed her the heaviness of a broken spirit and of pining and palsying faculties settled slow on her buoyant youth Winter seemed conquering her spring the mind s soil and its treasures were freezing gradually to barren stagnation CHAPTER XI FIELDHEAD Yet <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> refused tamely to succumb She had native strength in her girl s heart and she used it Men and women never struggle so hard as when they struggle alone without witness counsellor or confidant unencouraged unadvised and unpitied Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was in this position Her sufferings were her only spur and being very real and sharp they roused her spirit keenly Bent on victory over a mortal pain she did her best to quell it Never had she been seen so busy so studious and above all so active She took walks in all weathers long walks in solitary directions Day by day she came back in the evening pale and wearied looking yet seemingly not fatigued for still as soon as she had thrown off her bonnet and shawl she would instead of resting begin to pace her apartment Sometimes she would not sit down till she was literally faint She said she did this to tire herself well that she might sleep soundly at night But if that was her aim it was unattained for at night when others slumbered she was tossing on her pillow or sitting at the foot of her couch in the darkness forgetful apparently of the necessity of seeking repose Often unhappy girl she was crying crying in a sort of intolerable despair which when it rushed over her smote down her strength and reduced her to childlike helplessness When thus prostrate temptations besieged her Weak suggestions whispered in her weary heart to write to <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and say that she was unhappy because she was forbidden to see him and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> and that she feared he would withdraw his friendship not love from her and forget her entirely and begging him to remember her and sometimes to write to her One or two such letters she actually indited but she never sent them shame and good sense forbade At last the life she led reached the point when it seemed she could bear it no longer that she must seek and find a change somehow or her heart and head would fail under the pressure which strained them She longed to leave <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> to go to some very distant place She longed for something else the deep secret anxious yearning to discover and know her mother strengthened daily but with the desire was coupled a doubt a dread if she knew her could she love her There was cause for hesitation for apprehension on this point Never in her life had she heard that mother praised whoever mentioned her mentioned her coolly Her uncle seemed to regard his sister in law with a sort of tacit antipathy an old servant who had lived with Mrs <PERSON>James Helstone</PERSON> for a short time after her marriage whenever she referred to her former mistress spoke with chilling reserve sometimes she called her queer sometimes she said she did not understand her These expressions were ice to the daughter s heart they suggested the conclusion that it was perhaps better never to know her parent than to know her and not like her But one project could she frame whose execution seemed likely to bring her a hope of relief it was to take a situation to be a governess she could do nothing else A little incident brought her to the point when she found courage to break her design to her uncle Her long and late walks lay always as has been said on lonely roads but in whatever direction she had rambled whether along the drear skirts of <LOCATION>Stilbro Moor</LOCATION> or over the sunny stretch of Nunnely Common her homeward path was still so contrived as to lead her near the Hollow She rarely descended the den but she visited its brink at twilight almost as regularly as the stars rose over the hillcrests Her resting place was at a certain stile under a certain old thorn Thence she could look down on the cottage the mill the dewy garden ground the still deep dam thence was visible the well known counting house window from whose panes at a fixed hour shot suddenly bright the ray of the well known lamp Her errand was to watch for this ray her reward to catch it sometimes sparkling bright in clear air sometimes shimmering dim through mist and anon flashing broken between slant lines of rain for she came in all weathers There were nights when it failed to appear She knew then that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was from home and went away doubly sad whereas its kindling rendered her elate as though she saw in it the promise of some indefinite hope If while she gazed a shadow bent between the light and lattice her heart leaped That eclipse was <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> she had seen him She would return home comforted carrying in her mind a clearer vision of his aspect a distincter recollection of his voice his smile his bearing and blent with these impressions was often a sweet persuasion that if she could get near him his heart might welcome her presence yet that at this moment he might be willing to extend his hand and draw her to him and shelter her at his side as he used to do That night though she might weep as usual she would fancy her tears less scalding the pillow they watered seemed a little softer the temples pressed to that pillow ached less The shortest path from the Hollow to the rectory wound near a certain mansion the same under whose lone walls <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> passed on that night journey mentioned in an early chapter of this work the old and tenantless dwelling yclept Fieldhead Tenantless by the proprietor it had been for ten years but it was no ruin Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> had seen it kept in good repair and an old gardener and his wife had lived in it cultivated the grounds and maintained the house in habitable condition If <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> had few other merits as a building it might at least be termed picturesque Its regular architecture and the gray and mossy colouring communicated by time gave it a just claim to this epithet The old latticed windows the stone porch the walls the roof the chimney stacks were rich in crayon touches and sepia lights and shades The trees behind were fine bold and spreading the cedar on the lawn in front was grand and the granite urns on the garden wall the fretted arch of the gateway were for an artist as the very desire of the eye One mild May evening <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> passing near about moonrise and feeling though weary unwilling yet to go home where there was only the bed of thorns and the night of grief to anticipate sat down on the mossy ground near the gate and gazed through towards cedar and mansion It was a still night calm dewy cloudless the gables turned to the west reflected the clear amber of the horizon they faced the oaks behind were black the cedar was blacker Under its dense raven boughs a glimpse of sky opened gravely blue It was full of the moon which looked solemnly and mildly down on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> from beneath that sombre canopy She felt this night and prospect mournfully lovely She wished she could be happy she wished she could know inward peace she wondered <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> had no pity on her and would not help or console her Recollections of happy trysts of lovers commemorated in old ballads returned on her mind she thought such tryst in such scene would be blissful Where now was <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> she asked Not at the Hollow she had watched for his lamp long and had not seen it She questioned within herself whether she and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> were ever destined to meet and speak again Suddenly the door within the stone porch of the hall opened and two men came out one elderly and white headed the other young dark haired and tall They passed across the lawn out through a portal in the garden wall <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> saw them cross the road pass the stile descend the fields she saw them disappear <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> had passed before her with his friend Mr <PERSON>Yorke Neither</PERSON> had seen her The apparition had been transient scarce seen ere gone but its electric passage left her veins kindled her soul insurgent It found her despairing it left her desperate two different states Oh had he but been alone had he but seen me was her cry He would have said something He would have given me his hand He _does_ he _must_ love me a little He would have shown some token of affection In his eye on his lips I should have read comfort but the chance is lost The wind the cloud s shadow does not pass more silently more emptily than he I have been mocked and Heaven is cruel Thus in the utter sickness of longing and disappointment she went home The next morning at breakfast where she appeared white cheeked and miserable looking as one who had seen a ghost she inquired of Mr Helstone Have you any objection uncle to my inquiring for a situation in a family Her uncle ignorant as the table supporting his coffee cup of all his niece had undergone and was undergoing scarcely believed his ears What whim now he asked Are you bewitched What can you mean I am not well and need a change she said He examined her He discovered she had _experienced_ a change at any rate Without his being aware of it the rose had dwindled and faded to a mere snowdrop bloom had vanished flesh wasted she sat before him drooping colourless and thin But for the soft expression of her brown eyes the delicate lines of her features and the flowing abundance of her hair she would no longer have possessed a claim to the epithet pretty What on earth is the matter with you he asked What is wrong How are you ailing No answer only the brown eyes filled the faintly tinted lips trembled Look out for a situation indeed For what situation are you fit What have you been doing with yourself You are not well I should be well if I went from home These women are incomprehensible They have the strangest knack of startling you with unpleasant surprises To day you see them bouncing buxom red as cherries and round as apples to morrow they exhibit themselves effete as dead weeds blanched and broken down And the reason of it all That s the puzzle She has her meals her liberty a good house to live in and good clothes to wear as usual A while since that sufficed to keep her handsome and cheery and there she sits now a poor little pale puling chit enough Provoking Then comes the question What is to be done I suppose I must send for advice Will you have a doctor child No uncle I don t want one A doctor could do me no good I merely want change of air and scene Well if that be the caprice it shall be gratified You shall go to a watering place I don t mind the expense Fanny shall accompany you But uncle some day I must do something for myself I have no fortune I had better begin now While I live you shall not turn out as a governess <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I will not have it said that my niece is a governess But the later in life one makes a change of that sort uncle the more difficult and painful it is I should wish to get accustomed to the yoke before any habits of ease and independence are formed I beg you will not harass me <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I mean to provide for you I have always meant to provide for you I will purchase an annuity Bless me I am but fifty five my health and constitution are excellent There is plenty of time to save and take measures <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t make yourself anxious respecting the future Is that what frets you No uncle but I long for a change He laughed There speaks the woman cried he the very woman A change a change Always fantastical and whimsical Well it s in her sex But it is not fantasy and whim uncle What is it then Necessity I think I feel weaker than formerly I believe I should have more to do Admirable She feels weak and _therefore_ she should be set to hard labour clair comme le jour as <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> confound <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> You shall go to <LOCATION>Cliff Bridge</LOCATION> and there are two guineas to buy a new frock Come <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> never fear We ll find balm in Gilead Uncle I wish you were less generous and more More what Sympathizing was the word on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s lips but it was not uttered She checked herself in time Her uncle would indeed have laughed if that namby pamby word had escaped her Finding her silent he said The fact is you don t know precisely what you want Only to be a governess <PERSON>Pooh</PERSON> mere nonsense I ll not hear of governessing <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t mention it again It is rather too feminine a fancy I have finished breakfast Ring the bell Put all crotchets out of your head and run away and amuse yourself What with My doll asked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to herself as she quitted the room A week or two passed her bodily and mental health neither grew worse nor better She was now precisely in that state when if her constitution had contained the seeds of consumption decline or slow fever those diseases would have been rapidly developed and would soon have carried her quietly from the world People never die of love or grief alone though some die of inherent maladies which the tortures of those passions prematurely force into destructive action The sound by nature undergo these tortures and are racked shaken shattered their beauty and bloom perish but life remains untouched They are brought to a certain point of dilapidation they are reduced to pallor debility and emaciation People think as they see them gliding languidly about that they will soon withdraw to sick beds perish there and cease from among the healthy and happy This does not happen They live on and though they cannot regain youth and gaiety they may regain strength and serenity The blossom which the March wind nips but fails to sweep away may survive to hang a withered apple on the tree late into autumn having braved the last frosts of spring it may also brave the first of winter Every one noticed the change in Miss Helstone s appearance and most people said she was going to die She never thought so herself She felt in no dying case she had neither pain nor sickness Her appetite was diminished she knew the reason It was because she wept so much at night Her strength was lessened she could account for it Sleep was coy and hard to be won dreams were distressing and baleful In the far future she still seemed to anticipate a time when this passage of misery should be got over and when she should once more be calm though perhaps never again happy Meanwhile her uncle urged her to visit to comply with the frequent invitations of their acquaintance This she evaded doing She could not be cheerful in company she felt she was observed there with more curiosity than sympathy Old ladies were always offering her their advice recommending this or that nostrum young ladies looked at her in a way she understood and from which she shrank Their eyes said they knew she had been disappointed as custom phrases it by whom they were not certain Commonplace young ladies can be quite as hard as commonplace young gentlemen quite as worldly and selfish Those who suffer should always avoid them Grief and calamity they despise they seem to regard them as the judgments of God on the lowly With them to love is merely to contrive a scheme for achieving a good match to be disappointed is to have their scheme seen through and frustrated They think the feelings and projects of others on the subject of love similar to their own and judge them accordingly All this <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knew partly by instinct partly by observation She regulated her conduct by her knowledge keeping her pale face and wasted figure as much out of sight as she could Living thus in complete seclusion she ceased to receive intelligence of the little transactions of the neighbourhood One morning her uncle came into the parlour where she sat endeavouring to find some pleasure in painting a little group of wild flowers gathered under a hedge at the top of the Hollow fields and said to her in his abrupt manner Come child you are always stooping over palette or book or sampler leave that tinting work By the bye do you put your pencil to your lips when you paint Sometimes uncle when I forget Then it is that which is poisoning you The paints are deleterious child There is white lead and red lead and verdigris and gamboge and twenty other poisons in those colour cakes Lock them up lock them up Get your bonnet on I want you to make a call with me With _you_ uncle This question was asked in a tone of surprise She was not accustomed to make calls with her uncle She never rode or walked out with him on any occasion Quick quick I am always busy you know I have no time to lose She hurriedly gathered up her materials asking meantime where they were going To Fieldhead Fieldhead What to see old <PERSON>James Booth</PERSON> the gardener Is he ill We are going to see Miss <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> Miss Keeldar Is she coming to <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> Is she at Fieldhead She is She has been there a week I met her at a party last night that party to which you would not go I was pleased with her I choose that you shall make her acquaintance It will do you good She is now come of age I suppose She is come of age and will reside for a time on her property I lectured her on the subject I showed her her duty She is not intractable She is rather a fine girl she will teach you what it is to have a sprightly spirit Nothing lackadaisical about _her_ I don t think she will want to see me or to have me introduced to her What good can I do her How can I amuse her Pshaw Put your bonnet on Is she proud uncle <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t know You hardly imagine she would show her pride to me I suppose A chit like that would scarcely presume to give herself airs with the rector of her parish however rich she might be No But how did she behave to other people Didn t observe She holds her head high and probably can be saucy enough where she dare She wouldn t be a woman otherwise There Away now for your bonnet at once Not naturally very confident a failure of physical strength and a depression of spirits had not tended to increase <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s presence of mind and ease of manner or to give her additional courage to face strangers and she quailed in spite of self remonstrance as she and her uncle walked up the broad paved approach leading from the gateway of <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> to its porch She followed Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> reluctantly through that porch into the sombre old vestibule beyond Very sombre it was long vast and dark one latticed window lit it but dimly The wide old chimney contained now no fire for the present warm weather needed it not it was filled instead with willow boughs The gallery on high opposite the entrance was seen but in outline so shadowy became this hall towards its ceiling Carved stags heads with real antlers looked down grotesquely from the walls This was neither a grand nor a comfortable house within as without it was antique rambling and incommodious A property of a thousand a year belonged to it which property had descended for lack of male heirs on a female There were mercantile families in the district boasting twice the income but the Keeldars by virtue of their antiquity and their distinction of lords of the manor took the precedence of all Mr and Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> were ushered into a parlour Of course as was to be expected in such a Gothic old barrack this parlour was lined with oak fine dark glossy panels compassed the walls gloomily and grandly Very handsome reader these shining brown panels are very mellow in colouring and tasteful in effect but if you know what a spring clean is very execrable and inhuman Whoever having the bowels of humanity has seen servants scrubbing at these polished wooden walls with beeswaxed cloths on a warm May day must allow that they are intolerable and not to be endured and I cannot but secretly applaud the benevolent barbarian who had painted another and larger apartment of Fieldhead the drawing room to wit formerly also an oak room of a delicate pinky white thereby earning for himself the character of a Hun but mightily enhancing the cheerfulness of that portion of his abode and saving future housemaids a world of toil The brown panelled parlour was furnished all in old style and with real old furniture On each side of the high mantelpiece stood two antique chairs of oak solid as silvan thrones and in one of these sat a lady But if this were Miss Keeldar she must have come of age at least some twenty years ago She was of matronly form and though she wore no cap and possessed hair of quite an undimmed auburn shading small and naturally young looking features she had no youthful aspect nor apparently the wish to assume it You could have wished her attire of a newer fashion In a well cut well made gown hers would have been no uncomely presence It puzzled you to guess why a garment of handsome materials should be arranged in such scanty folds and devised after such an obsolete mode You felt disposed to set down the wearer as somewhat eccentric at once This lady received the visitors with a mixture of ceremony and diffidence quite English No middle aged matron who was not an Englishwoman _could_ evince precisely the same manner a manner so uncertain of herself of her own merits of her power to please and yet so anxious to be proper and if possible rather agreeable than otherwise In the present instance however more embarrassment was shown than is usual even with diffident Englishwomen Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> felt this sympathized with the stranger and knowing by experience what was good for the timid took a seat quietly near her and began to talk to her with a gentle ease communicated for the moment by the presence of one less self possessed than herself She and this lady would if alone have at once got on extremely well together The lady had the clearest voice imaginable infinitely softer and more tuneful than could have been reasonably expected from forty years and a form decidedly inclined to _embonpoint_ This voice <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> liked it atoned for the formal if correct accent and language The lady would soon have discovered she liked it and her and in ten minutes they would have been friends But Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> stood on the rug looking at them both looking especially at the strange lady with his sarcastic keen eye that clearly expressed impatience of her chilly ceremony and annoyance at her want of _aplomb_ His hard gaze and rasping voice discomfited the lady more and more She tried however to get up little speeches about the weather the aspect of the country etc but the impracticable Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> presently found himself somewhat deaf Whatever she said he affected not to hear distinctly and she was obliged to go over each elaborately constructed nothing twice The effort soon became too much for her She was just rising in a perplexed flutter nervously murmuring that she knew not what detained <PERSON>Miss Keeldar</PERSON> that she would go and look for her when Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> saved her the trouble by appearing It was to be presumed at least that she who now came in through a glass door from the garden owned that name There is real grace in ease of manner and so old <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> felt when an erect slight girl walked up to him retaining with her left hand her little silk apron full of flowers and giving him her right hand said pleasantly I knew you would come to see me though you _do_ think Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> has made me a Jacobin Good morning But we ll not have you a Jacobin returned he No Miss <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> they shall not steal the flower of my parish from me Now that you are amongst us you shall be my pupil in politics and religion I ll teach you sound doctrine on both points <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> has anticipated you she replied turning to the elder lady <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> you know was my governess and is still my friend and of all the high and rigid Tories she is queen of all the stanch churchwomen she is chief I have been well drilled both in theology and history I assure you Mr Helstone The rector immediately bowed very low to <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and expressed himself obliged to her The ex governess disclaimed skill either in political or religious controversy explained that she thought such matters little adapted for female minds but avowed herself in general terms the advocate of order and loyalty and of course truly attached to the Establishment She added she was ever averse to change under any circumstances and something scarcely audible about the extreme danger of being too ready to take up new ideas closed her sentence Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> thinks as you think I hope madam Difference of age and difference of temperament occasion difference of sentiment was the reply It can scarcely be expected that the eager and young should hold the opinions of the cool and middle aged Oh oh we are independent we think for ourselves cried Mr Helstone We are a little Jacobin for anything I know a little freethinker in good earnest Let us have a confession of faith on the spot And he took the heiress s two hands causing her to let fall her whole cargo of flowers and seated her by him on the sofa Say your creed he ordered The Apostles Creed Yes She said it like a child Now for <ORGANIZATION>St Athanasius</ORGANIZATION> s That s the test Let me gather up my flowers Here is Tartar coming he will tread upon them Tartar was a rather large strong and fierce looking dog very ugly being of a breed between mastiff and bulldog who at this moment entered through the glass door and posting directly to the rug snuffed the fresh flowers scattered there He seemed to scorn them as food but probably thinking their velvety petals might be convenient as litter he was turning round preparatory to depositing his tawny bulk upon them when Miss Helstone and Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> simultaneously stooped to the rescue Thank you said the heiress as she again held out her little apron for <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to heap the blossoms into it Is this your daughter <PERSON>Mr Helstone</PERSON> she asked My niece <PERSON>Caroline Miss Keeldar</PERSON> shook hands with her and then looked at her <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> also looked at her hostess <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> she had no Christian name but <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> her parents who had wished to have a son finding that after eight years of marriage <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> had granted them only a daughter bestowed on her the same masculine family cognomen they would have bestowed on a boy if with a boy they had been blessed <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> was no ugly heiress She was agreeable to the eye Her height and shape were not unlike Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s perhaps in stature she might have the advantage by an inch or two She was gracefully made and her face too possessed a charm as well described by the word grace as any other It was pale naturally but intelligent and of varied expression She was not a blonde like <PERSON>Caroline Clear</PERSON> and dark were the characteristics of her aspect as to colour Her face and brow were clear her eyes of the darkest gray no green lights in them transparent pure neutral gray and her hair of the darkest brown Her features were distinguished by which I do not mean that they were high bony and Roman being indeed rather small and slightly marked than otherwise but only that they were to use a few French words fins gracieux spirituels mobile they were and speaking but their changes were not to be understood nor their language interpreted all at once She examined <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> seriously inclining her head a little to one side with a thoughtful air You see she is only a feeble chick observed Mr Helstone She looks young younger than I How old are you she inquired in a manner that would have been patronizing if it had not been extremely solemn and simple Eighteen years and six months And I am twenty one She said no more She had now placed her flowers on the table and was busied in arranging them And St Athanasius s Creed urged the rector You believe it all don t you I can t remember it quite all I will give you a nosegay Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> when I have given your niece one She had selected a little bouquet of one brilliant and two or three delicate flowers relieved by a spray of dark verdure She tied it with silk from her work box and placed it on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s lap and then she put her hands behind her and stood bending slightly towards her guest still regarding her in the attitude and with something of the aspect of a grave but gallant little cavalier This temporary expression of face was aided by the style in which she wore her hair parted on one temple and brushed in a glossy sweep above the forehead whence it fell in curls that looked natural so free were their wavy undulations Are you tired with your walk she inquired No not in the least It is but a short distance but a mile You look pale Is she always so pale she asked turning to the rector She used to be as rosy as the reddest of your flowers Why is she altered What has made her pale Has she been ill She tells me she wants a change She ought to have one You ought to give her one You should send her to the sea coast I will ere summer is over Meantime I intend her to make acquaintance with you if you have no objection I am sure Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> will have no objection here observed <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> I think I may take it upon me to say that Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s frequent presence at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> will be esteemed a favour You speak my sentiments precisely ma am said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and I thank you for anticipating me Let me tell you she continued turning again to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> that you also ought to thank my governess It is not every one she would welcome as she has welcomed you You are distinguished more than you think This morning as soon as you are gone I shall ask <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> s opinion of you I am apt to rely on her judgment of character for hitherto I have found it wondrous accurate Already I foresee a favourable answer to my inquiries Do I not guess rightly Mrs Pryor My dear you said but now you would ask my opinion when Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was gone I am scarcely likely to give it in her presence No and perhaps it will be long enough before I obtain it I am sometimes sadly tantalized Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> by Mrs Pryor s extreme caution Her judgments ought to be correct when they come for they are often as tardy of delivery as a Lord Chancellor s On some people s characters I cannot get her to pronounce a sentence entreat as I may <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> here smiled Yes said her pupil I know what that smile means You are thinking of my gentleman tenant Do you know Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> of the Hollow she asked Mr Helstone Ay ay Your tenant so he is You have seen a good deal of him no doubt since you came I have been obliged to see him There was business to transact Business Really the word makes me conscious I am indeed no longer a girl but quite a woman and something more I am an esquire <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar Esquire</PERSON> ought to be my style and title They gave me a man s name I hold a man s position It is enough to inspire me with a touch of manhood and when I see such people as that stately Anglo Belgian that G rard <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> before me gravely talking to me of business really I feel quite gentlemanlike You must choose me for your churchwarden Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> the next time you elect new ones They ought to make me a magistrate and a captain of yeomanry <PERSON>Tony Lumpkin</PERSON> s mother was a colonel and his aunt a justice of the peace Why shouldn t I be With all my heart If you choose to get up a requisition on the subject I promise to head the list of signatures with my name But you were speaking of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Ah yes I find it a little difficult to understand Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to know what to think of him whether to like him or not He seems a tenant of whom any proprietor might be proud and proud of him I am in that sense but as a neighbour what is he Again and again I have entreated <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> to say what she thinks of him but she still evades returning a direct answer I hope you will be less oracular Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and pronounce at once Do you like him Not at all just now His name is entirely blotted from my good books What is the matter What has he done My uncle and he disagree on politics interposed the low voice of Caroline She had better not have spoken just then Having scarcely joined in the conversation before it was not apropos to do it now She felt this with nervous acuteness as soon as she had spoken and coloured to the eyes What are <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s politics inquired <PERSON>Shirley Those</PERSON> of a tradesman returned the rector narrow selfish and unpatriotic The man is eternally writing and speaking against the continuance of the war I have no patience with him The war hurts his trade I remember he remarked that only yesterday But what other objection have you to him That is enough He looks the gentleman in my sense of the term pursued <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and it pleases me to think he is such <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rent the Tyrian petals of the one brilliant flower in her bouquet and answered in distinct tones Decidedly he is <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> hearing this courageous affirmation flashed an arch searching glance at the speaker from her deep expressive eyes _You_ are his friend at any rate she said You defend him in his absence I am both his friend and his relative was the prompt reply <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> is my cousin Oh then you can tell me all about him Just give me a sketch of his character Insuperable embarrassment seized <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when this demand was made She could not and did not attempt to comply with it Her silence was immediately covered by <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> who proceeded to address sundry questions to Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> regarding a family or two in the neighbourhood with whose connections in the south she said she was acquainted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> soon withdrew her gaze from Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s face She did not renew her interrogations but returning to her flowers proceeded to choose a nosegay for the rector She presented it to him as he took leave and received the homage of a salute on the hand in return Be sure you wear it for my sake said she Next my heart of course responded Helstone Mrs Pryor take care of this future magistrate this churchwarden in perspective this captain of yeomanry this young squire of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> in a word <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t let him exert himself too much don t let him break his neck in hunting especially let him mind how he rides down that dangerous hill near the Hollow I like a descent said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I like to clear it rapidly and especially I like that romantic Hollow with all my heart Romantic with a mill in it Romantic with a mill in it The old mill and the white cottage are each admirable in its way And the counting house Mr Keeldar The counting house is better than my bloom coloured drawing room I adore the counting house And the trade The cloth the greasy wool the polluting dyeing vats The trade is to be thoroughly respected And the tradesman is a hero Good I am glad to hear you say so I thought the tradesman looked heroic Mischief spirit and glee sparkled all over her face as she thus bandied words with the old Cossack who almost equally enjoyed the tilt Captain <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> you have no mercantile blood in your veins Why are you so fond of trade Because I am a mill owner of course Half my income comes from the works in that <ORGANIZATION>Hollow Don</ORGANIZATION> t enter into partnership that s all You ve put it into my head you ve put it into my head she exclaimed with a joyous laugh It will never get out Thank you And waving her hand white as a lily and fine as a fairy s she vanished within the porch while the rector and his niece passed out through the arched gateway CHAPTER XII <PERSON>SHIRLEY</PERSON> AND <PERSON>CAROLINE Shirley</PERSON> showed she had been sincere in saying she should be glad of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s society by frequently seeking it and indeed if she had not sought it she would not have had it for Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was slow to make fresh acquaintance She was always held back by the idea that people could not want her that she could not amuse them and a brilliant happy youthful creature like the heiress of <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> seemed to her too completely independent of society so uninteresting as hers ever to find it really welcome <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> might be brilliant and probably happy likewise but no one is independent of genial society and though in about a month she had made the acquaintance of most of the families round and was on quite free and easy terms with all the Misses <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> and all the Misses <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> and the two superlative Misses <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Walden Hall</LOCATION> yet it appeared she found none amongst them very genial she fraternized with none of them to use her own words If she had had the bliss to be really <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar Esq</PERSON> lord of the manor of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> there was not a single fair one in this and the two neighbouring parishes whom she should have felt disposed to request to become <PERSON>Mrs Keeldar</PERSON> lady of the manor This declaration she made to <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> who received it very quietly as she did most of her pupil s off hand speeches responding My dear do not allow that habit of alluding to yourself as a gentleman to be confirmed It is a strange one Those who do not know you hearing you speak thus would think you affected masculine manners <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> never laughed at her former governess even the little formalities and harmless peculiarities of that lady were respectable in her eyes Had it been otherwise she would have proved herself a weak character at once for it is only the weak who make a butt of quiet worth Therefore she took her remonstrance in silence She stood quietly near the window looking at the grand cedar on her lawn watching a bird on one of its lower boughs Presently she began to chirrup to the bird soon her chirrup grew clearer ere long she was whistling the whistle struck into a tune and very sweetly and deftly it was executed My dear expostulated <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> Was I whistling said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I forgot I beg your pardon ma am I had resolved to take care not to whistle before you But Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> where did you learn to whistle You must have got the habit since you came down into <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> I never knew you guilty of it before Oh I learned to whistle a long while ago Who taught you No one I took it up by listening and I had laid it down again But lately yesterday evening as I was coming up our lane I heard a gentleman whistling that very tune in the field on the other side of the hedge and that reminded me What gentleman was it We have only one gentleman in this region ma am and that is Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> at least he is the only gentleman who is not gray haired My two venerable favourites Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> it is true are fine old beaus infinitely better than any of the stupid young ones <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> was silent You do not like Mr <PERSON>Helstone ma</PERSON> am My dear Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s office secures him from criticism You generally contrive to leave the room when he is announced Do you walk out this morning my dear Yes I shall go to the rectory and seek and find <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> and make her take some exercise She shall have a breezy walk over Nunnely Common If you go in that direction my dear have the goodness to remind Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> to wrap up well as there is a fresh wind and she appears to me to require care You shall be minutely obeyed Mrs Pryor Meantime will you not accompany us yourself No my love I should be a restraint upon you I am stout and cannot walk so quickly as you would wish to do <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> easily persuaded <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to go with her and when they were fairly out on the quiet road traversing the extensive and solitary sweep of Nunnely Common she as easily drew her into conversation The first feelings of diffidence overcome <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> soon felt glad to talk with Miss Keeldar The very first interchange of slight observations sufficed to give each an idea of what the other was <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> said she liked the green sweep of the common turf and better still the heath on its ridges for the heath reminded her of moors She had seen moors when she was travelling on the borders near <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> She remembered particularly a district traversed one long afternoon on a sultry but sunless day in summer They journeyed from noon till sunset over what seemed a boundless waste of deep heath and nothing had they seen but wild sheep nothing heard but the cries of wild birds I know how the heath would look on such a day said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> purple black a deeper shade of the sky tint and that would be livid Yes quite livid with brassy edges to the clouds and here and there a white gleam more ghastly than the lurid tinge which as you looked at it you momentarily expected would kindle into blinding lightning Did it thunder It muttered distant peals but the storm did not break till evening after we had reached our inn that inn being an isolated house at the foot of a range of mountains Did you watch the clouds come down over the mountains I did I stood at the window an hour watching them The hills seemed rolled in a sullen mist and when the rain fell in whitening sheets suddenly they were blotted from the prospect they were washed from the world I have seen such storms in hilly districts in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> and at their riotous climax while the sky was all cataract the earth all flood I have remembered the Deluge It is singularly reviving after such hurricanes to feel calm return and from the opening clouds to receive a consolatory gleam softly testifying that the sun is not quenched Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> just stand still now and look down at Nunnely dale and wood They both halted on the green brow of the common They looked down on the deep valley robed in May raiment on varied meads some pearled with daisies and some golden with king cups To day all this young verdure smiled clear in sunlight transparent emerald and amber gleams played over it On <LOCATION>Nunnwood</LOCATION> the sole remnant of antique British forest in a region whose lowlands were once all silvan chase as its highlands were breast deep heather slept the shadow of a cloud the distant hills were dappled the horizon was shaded and tinted like mother of pearl silvery blues soft purples evanescent greens and rose shades all melting into fleeces of white cloud pure as azury snow allured the eye as with a remote glimpse of heaven s foundations The air blowing on the brow was fresh and sweet and bracing Our <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> is a bonny island said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> is one of her bonniest nooks You are a <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> girl too I am <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> in blood and birth Five generations of my race sleep under the aisles of <ORGANIZATION>Briarfield Church</ORGANIZATION> I drew my first breath in the old black hall behind us <PERSON>Hereupon Caroline</PERSON> presented her hand which was accordingly taken and shaken We are compatriots said she Yes agreed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> with a grave nod And that asked Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> pointing to the forest that is Nunnwood It is Were you ever there Many a time In the heart of it Yes What is it like It is like an encampment of forest sons of Anak The trees are huge and old When you stand at their roots the summits seem in another region The trunks remain still and firm as pillars while the boughs sway to every breeze In the deepest calm their leaves are never quite hushed and in high wind a flood rushes a sea thunders above you Was it not one of <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON> s haunts Yes and there are mementos of him still existing To penetrate into <LOCATION>Nunnwood Miss Keeldar</LOCATION> is to go far back into the dim days of old Can you see a break in the forest about the centre Yes distinctly That break is a dell a deep hollow cup lined with turf as green and short as the sod of this common The very oldest of the trees gnarled mighty oaks crowd about the brink of this dell In the bottom lie the ruins of a nunnery We will go you and I alone <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to that wood early some fine summer morning and spend a long day there We can take pencils and sketch books and any interesting reading book we like and of course we shall take something to eat I have two little baskets in which <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> my housekeeper might pack our provisions and we could each carry our own It would not tire you too much to walk so far Oh no especially if we rested the whole day in the wood And I know all the pleasantest spots I know where we could get nuts in nutting time I know where wild strawberries abound I know certain lonely quite untrodden glades carpeted with strange mosses some yellow as if gilded some a sober gray some gem green I know groups of trees that ravish the eye with their perfect picture like effects rude oak delicate birch glossy beech clustered in contrast and ash trees stately as <PERSON>Saul</PERSON> standing isolated and superannuated wood giants clad in bright shrouds of ivy Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> I could guide you You would be dull with me alone I should not I think we should suit and what third person is there whose presence would not spoil our pleasure Indeed I know of none about our own ages no lady at least and as to gentlemen An excursion becomes quite a different thing when there are gentlemen of the party interrupted <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I agree with you quite a different thing to what we were proposing We were going simply to see the old trees the old ruins to pass a day in old times surrounded by olden silence and above all by quietude You are right and the presence of gentlemen dispels the last charm I think If they are of the wrong sort like your Malones and your young <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> and Wynnes irritation takes the place of serenity If they are of the right sort there is still a change I can hardly tell what change one easy to feel difficult to describe We forget Nature _imprimis_ And then Nature forgets us covers her vast calm brow with a dim veil conceals her face and withdraws the peaceful joy with which if we had been content to worship her only she would have filled our hearts What does she give us instead More elation and more anxiety an excitement that steals the hours away fast and a trouble that ruffles their course Our power of being happy lies a good deal in ourselves I believe remarked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sagely I have gone to <LOCATION>Nunnwood</LOCATION> with a large party all the curates and some other gentry of these parts together with sundry ladies and I found the affair insufferably tedious and absurd and I have gone quite alone or accompanied but by <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> who sat in the woodman s hut and sewed or talked to the goodwife while I roamed about and made sketches or read and I have enjoyed much happiness of a quiet kind all day long But that was when I was young two years ago Did you ever go with your cousin <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> Yes once What sort of a companion is he on these occasions A cousin you know is different to a stranger I am aware of that but cousins if they are stupid are still more insupportable than strangers because you cannot so easily keep them at a distance But your cousin is not stupid No but Well If the company of fools irritates as you say the society of clever men leaves its own peculiar pain also Where the goodness or talent of your friend is beyond and above all doubt your own worthiness to be his associate often becomes a matter of question Oh there I cannot follow you That crotchet is not one I should choose to entertain for an instant I consider myself not unworthy to be the associate of the best of them of gentlemen I mean though that is saying a great deal Where they are good they are very good I believe Your uncle by the bye is not a bad specimen of the elderly gentleman I am always glad to see his brown keen sensible old face either in my own house or any other Are you fond of him Is he kind to you Now speak the truth He has brought me up from childhood I doubt not precisely as he would have brought up his own daughter if he had had one and that is kindness But I am not fond of him I would rather be out of his presence than in it Strange when he has the art of making himself so agreeable Yes in company but he is stern and silent at home As he puts away his cane and shovel hat in the rectory hall so he locks his liveliness in his book case and study desk the knitted brow and brief word for the fireside the smile the jest the witty sally for society Is he tyrannical Not in the least He is neither tyrannical nor hypocritical He is simply a man who is rather liberal than good natured rather brilliant than genial rather scrupulously equitable than truly just if you can understand such superfine distinctions Oh yes Good nature implies indulgence which he has not geniality warmth of heart which he does not own and genuine justice is the offspring of sympathy and considerateness of which I can well conceive my bronzed old friend is quite innocent I often wonder <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> whether most men resemble my uncle in their domestic relations whether it is necessary to be new and unfamiliar to them in order to seem agreeable or estimable in their eyes and whether it is impossible to their natures to retain a constant interest and affection for those they see every day I don t know I can t clear up your doubts I ponder over similar ones myself sometimes But to tell you a secret if I were convinced that they are necessarily and universally different from us fickle soon petrifying unsympathizing I would never marry I should not like to find out that what I loved did not love me that it was weary of me and that whatever effort I might make to please would hereafter be worse than useless since it was inevitably in its nature to change and become indifferent That discovery once made what should I long for To go away to remove from a presence where my society gave no pleasure But you could not if you were married No I could not There it is I could never be my own mistress more A terrible thought It suffocates me Nothing irks me like the idea of being a burden and a bore an inevitable burden a ceaseless bore Now when I feel my company superfluous I can comfortably fold my independence round me like a mantle and drop my pride like a veil and withdraw to solitude If married that could not be I wonder we don t all make up our minds to remain single said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> We should if we listened to the wisdom of experience My uncle always speaks of marriage as a burden and I believe whenever he hears of a man being married he invariably regards him as a fool or at any rate as doing a foolish thing But <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> men are not all like your uncle Surely not I hope not She paused and mused I suppose we each find an exception in the one we love till we _are_ married suggested <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I suppose so And this exception we believe to be of sterling materials We fancy it like ourselves we imagine a sense of harmony We think his voice gives the softest truest promise of a heart that will never harden against us we read in his eyes that faithful feeling affection I don t think we should trust to what they call passion at all <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I believe it is a mere fire of dry sticks blazing up and vanishing But we watch him and see him kind to animals to little children to poor people He is kind to us likewise good considerate He does not flatter women but he is patient with them and he seems to be easy in their presence and to find their company genial He likes them not only for vain and selfish reasons but as _we_ like him because we like him Then we observe that he is just that he always speaks the truth that he is conscientious We feel joy and peace when he comes into a room we feel sadness and trouble when he leaves it We know that this man has been a kind son that he is a kind brother <PERSON>Will</PERSON> any one dare to tell me that he will not be a kind husband My uncle would affirm it unhesitatingly He will be sick of you in a month he would say Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> would seriously intimate the same Mrs <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> would darkly suggest ditto If they are true oracles it is good never to fall in love Very good if you can avoid it I choose to doubt their truth I am afraid that proves you are already caught Not I But if I were do you know what soothsayers I would consult Let me hear Neither man nor woman elderly nor young the little Irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door the mouse that steals out of the cranny in the wainscot the bird that in frost and snow pecks at my window for a crumb the dog that licks my hand and sits beside my knee Did you ever see any one who was kind to such things Did you ever see any one whom such things seemed instinctively to follow like rely on We have a black cat and an old dog at the rectory I know somebody to whose knee that black cat loves to climb against whose shoulder and cheek it likes to purr The old dog always comes out of his kennel and wags his tail and whines affectionately when somebody passes And what does that somebody do He quietly strokes the cat and lets her sit while he conveniently can and when he must disturb her by rising he puts her softly down and never flings her from him roughly He always whistles to the dog and gives him a caress Does he It is not Robert But it is <PERSON>Robert Handsome</PERSON> fellow said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> with enthusiasm Her eyes sparkled Is he not handsome Has he not fine eyes and well cut features and a clear princely forehead He has all that <PERSON>Caroline Bless</PERSON> him he is both graceful and good I was sure you would see that he was When I first looked at your face I knew you would I was well inclined to him before I saw him I liked him when I did see him I admire him now There is charm in beauty for itself <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when it is blent with goodness there is a powerful charm When mind is added <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Who can resist it Remember my uncle <PERSON>Mesdames Pryor Yorke</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> Remember the croaking of the frogs of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> He is a noble being I tell you when they _are_ good they are the lords of the creation they are the sons of God Moulded in their Maker s image the minutest spark of His spirit lifts them almost above mortality Indisputably a great good handsome man is the first of created things Above us I would scorn to contend for empire with him I would scorn it Shall my left hand dispute for precedence with my right Shall my heart quarrel with my pulse Shall my veins be jealous of the blood which fills them Men and women husbands and wives quarrel horribly <PERSON>Shirley Poor</PERSON> things Poor fallen degenerate things God made them for another lot for other feelings But are we men s equals or are we not Nothing ever charms me more than when I meet my superior one who makes me sincerely feel that he is my superior Did you ever meet him I should be glad to see him any day The higher above me so much the better It degrades to stoop it is glorious to look up What frets me is that when I try to esteem I am baffled when religiously inclined there are but false gods to adore I disdain to be a pagan Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> will you come in We are here at the rectory gates Not to day but to morrow I shall fetch you to spend the evening with me <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> if you really are what at present to me you seem you and I will suit I have never in my whole life been able to talk to a young lady as I have talked to you this morning Kiss me and good bye <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> seemed as well disposed to cultivate <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s acquaintance as <PERSON>Shirley She</PERSON> who went nowhere else called on an early day at the rectory She came in the afternoon when the rector happened to be out It was rather a close day the heat of the weather had flushed her and she seemed fluttered too by the circumstance of entering a strange house for it appeared her habits were most retiring and secluded When Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> went to her in the dining room she found her seated on the sofa trembling fanning herself with her handkerchief and seeming to contend with a nervous discomposure that threatened to become hysterical <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> marvelled somewhat at this unusual want of self command in a lady of her years and also at the lack of real strength in one who appeared almost robust for <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> hastened to allege the fatigue of her walk the heat of the sun etc as reasons for her temporary indisposition and still as with more hurry than coherence she again and again enumerated these causes of exhaustion <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> gently sought to relieve her by opening her shawl and removing her bonnet Attentions of this sort Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> would not have accepted from every one In general she recoiled from touch or close approach with a mixture of embarrassment and coldness far from flattering to those who offered her aid To Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s little light hand however she yielded tractably and seemed soothed by its contact In a few minutes she ceased to tremble and grew quiet and tranquil Her usual manner being resumed she proceeded to talk of ordinary topics In a miscellaneous company Mrs Pryor rarely opened her lips or if obliged to speak she spoke under restraint and consequently not well in dialogue she was a good converser Her language always a little formal was well chosen her sentiments were just her information was varied and correct <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> felt it pleasant to listen to her more pleasant than she could have anticipated On the wall opposite the sofa where they sat hung three pictures the centre one above the mantelpiece that of a lady the two others male portraits That is a beautiful face said Mrs Pryor interrupting a brief pause which had followed half an hour s animated conversation The features may be termed perfect no statuary s chisel could improve them It is a portrait from the life I presume It is a portrait of Mrs Helstone Of Mrs Matthewson Helstone Of your uncle s wife It is and is said to be a good likeness Before her marriage she was accounted the beauty of the district I should say she merited the distinction What accuracy in all the lineaments It is however a passive face The original could not have been what is generally termed a woman of spirit I believe she was a remarkably still silent person One would scarcely have expected my dear that your uncle s choice should have fallen on a partner of that description Is he not fond of being amused by lively chat In company he is But he always says he could never do with a talking wife He must have quiet at home You go out to gossip he affirms you come home to read and reflect <PERSON>Mrs Matthewson</PERSON> lived but a few years after her marriage I think I have heard About five years Well my dear pursued <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> rising to go I trust it is understood that you will frequently come to Fieldhead I hope you will You must feel lonely here having no female relative in the house you must necessarily pass much of your time in solitude I am inured to it I have grown up by myself May I arrange your shawl for you <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> submitted to be assisted Should you chance to require help in your studies she said you may command me <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> expressed her sense of such kindness I hope to have frequent conversations with you I should wish to be of use to you Again Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> returned thanks She thought what a kind heart was hidden under her visitor s seeming chilliness Observing that <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> again glanced with an air of interest towards the portraits as she walked down the room <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> casually explained The likeness that hangs near the window you will see is my uncle taken twenty years ago the other to the left of the mantelpiece is his brother <PERSON>James</PERSON> my father They resemble each other in some measure said <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> yet a difference of character may be traced in the different mould of the brow and mouth What difference inquired <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> accompanying her to the door <PERSON>James Helstone</PERSON> that is my father is generally considered the best looking of the two Strangers I remark always exclaim What a handsome man Do you think his picture handsome Mrs Pryor It is much softer or finer featured than that of your uncle But where or what is the difference of character to which you alluded Tell me I wish to see if you guess right My dear your uncle is a man of principle His forehead and his lips are firm and his eye is steady Well and the other Do not be afraid of offending me I always like the truth Do you like the truth It is well for you Adhere to that preference never swerve thence The other my dear if he had been living now would probably have furnished little support to his daughter It is however a graceful head taken in youth I should think My dear turning abruptly you acknowledge an inestimable value in principle I am sure no character can have true worth without it You feel what you say You have considered the subject Often Circumstances early forced it upon my attention The lesson was not lost then though it came so prematurely I suppose the soil is not light nor stony otherwise seed falling in that season never would have borne fruit My dear do not stand in the air of the door you will take cold Good afternoon Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s new acquaintance soon became of value to her their society was acknowledged a privilege She found she would have been in error indeed to have let slip this chance of relief to have neglected to avail herself of this happy change A turn was thereby given to her thoughts a new channel was opened for them which diverting a few of them at least from the one direction in which all had hitherto tended abated the impetuosity of their rush and lessened the force of their pressure on one worn down point Soon she was content to spend whole days at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> doing by turns whatever <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> or Mrs Pryor wished her to do and now one would claim her now the other Nothing could be less demonstrative than the friendship of the elder lady but also nothing could be more vigilant assiduous untiring I have intimated that she was a peculiar personage and in nothing was her peculiarity more shown than in the nature of the interest she evinced for <PERSON>Caroline She</PERSON> watched all her movements she seemed as if she would have guarded all her steps It gave her pleasure to be applied to by <PERSON>Miss Helstone</PERSON> for advice and assistance She yielded her aid when asked with such quiet yet obvious enjoyment that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> ere long took delight in depending on her <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> s complete docility with <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> had at first surprised Miss Helstone and not less the fact of the reserved ex governess being so much at home and at ease in the residence of her young pupil where she filled with such quiet independency a very dependent post but she soon found that it needed but to know both ladies to comprehend fully the enigma Every one it seemed to her must like must love must prize <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> when they knew her No matter that she perseveringly wore old fashioned gowns that her speech was formal and her manner cool that she had twenty little ways such as nobody else had she was still such a stay such a counsellor so truthful so kind in her way that in <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s idea none once accustomed to her presence could easily afford to dispense with it As to dependency or humiliation <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> did not feel it in her intercourse with <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and why should Mrs Pryor The heiress was rich very rich compared with her new friend one possessed a clear thousand a year the other not a penny and yet there was a safe sense of equality experienced in her society never known in that of the ordinary <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> and Whinbury gentry The reason was <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s head ran on other things than money and position She was glad to be independent as to property by fits she was even elated at the notion of being lady of the manor and having tenants and an estate She was especially tickled with an agreeable complacency when reminded of all that property down in the Hollow comprising an excellent cloth mill dyehouse warehouse together with the messuage gardens and outbuildings termed Hollow s Cottage but her exultation being quite undisguised was singularly inoffensive and for her serious thoughts they tended elsewhere To admire the great reverence the good and be joyous with the genial was very much the bent of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s soul she mused therefore on the means of following this bent far oftener than she pondered on her social superiority In <PERSON>Caroline Miss Keeldar</PERSON> had first taken an interest because she was quiet retiring looked delicate and seemed as if she needed some one to take care of her Her predilection increased greatly when she discovered that her own way of thinking and talking was understood and responded to by this new acquaintance She had hardly expected it Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> she fancied had too pretty a face manners and voice too soft to be anything out of the common way in mind and attainments and she very much wondered to see the gentle features light up archly to the reveille of a dry sally or two risked by herself and more did she wonder to discover the self won knowledge treasured and the untaught speculations working in that girlish curl veiled head <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s instinct of taste too was like her own Such books as Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> had read with the most pleasure were Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s delight also They held many aversions too in common and could have the comfort of laughing together over works of false sentimentality and pompous pretension Few <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> conceived men or women have the right taste in poetry the right sense for discriminating between what is real and what is false She had again and again heard very clever people pronounce this or that passage in this or that versifier altogether admirable which when she read her soul refused to acknowledge as anything but cant flourish and tinsel or at the best elaborate wordiness curious clever learned perhaps haply even tinged with the fascinating hues of fancy but God knows as different from real poetry as the gorgeous and massy vase of mosaic is from the little cup of pure metal or to give the reader a choice of similes as the milliner s artificial wreath is from the fresh gathered lily of the field <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> she found felt the value of the true ore and knew the deception of the flashy dross The minds of the two girls being toned in harmony often chimed very sweetly together One evening they chanced to be alone in the oak parlour They had passed a long wet day together without _ennui_ It was now on the edge of dark candles were not yet brought in both as twilight deepened grew meditative and silent A western wind roared high round the hall driving wild clouds and stormy rain up from the far remote ocean all was tempest outside the antique lattices all deep peace within <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> sat at the window watching the rack in heaven the mist on earth listening to certain notes of the gale that plained like restless spirits notes which had she not been so young gay and healthy would have swept her trembling nerves like some omen some anticipatory dirge In this her prime of existence and bloom of beauty they but subdued vivacity to pensiveness Snatches of sweet ballads haunted her ear now and then she sang a stanza Her accents obeyed the fitful impulse of the wind they swelled as its gusts rushed on and died as they wandered away <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> withdrawn to the farthest and darkest end of the room her figure just discernible by the ruby shine of the flameless fire was pacing to and fro muttering to herself fragments of well remembered poetry She spoke very low but <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> heard her and while singing softly she listened This was the strain Obscurest night involved the sky The <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> billows roared When such a destined wretch as I Washed headlong from on board Of friends of hope of all bereft His floating home for ever left Here the fragment stopped because <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s song erewhile somewhat full and thrilling had become delicately faint Go on said she Then you go on too I was only repeating The Castaway I know If you can remember it all say it all And as it was nearly dark and after all Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was no formidable auditor <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> went through it She went through it as she should have gone through it The wild sea the drowning mariner the reluctant ship swept on in the storm you heard were realized by her and more vividly was realized the heart of the poet who did not weep for The Castaway but who in an hour of tearless anguish traced a semblance to his own God abandoned misery in the fate of that man forsaken sailor and cried from the depths where he struggled No voice divine the storm allayed No light propitious shone When snatched from all effectual aid We perished each alone But I beneath a rougher sea And whelmed in deeper gulfs than he I hope <PERSON>William Cowper</PERSON> is safe and calm in heaven now said <PERSON>Caroline Do</PERSON> you pity what he suffered on earth asked Miss Keeldar Pity him <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> What can I do else He was nearly broken hearted when he wrote that poem and it almost breaks one s heart to read it But he found relief in writing it I know he did and that gift of poetry the most divine bestowed on man was I believe granted to allay emotions when their strength threatens harm It seems to me <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> that nobody should write poetry to exhibit intellect or attainment Who cares for that sort of poetry Who cares for learning who cares for fine words in poetry And who does not care for feeling real feeling however simply even rudely expressed It seems you care for it at all events and certainly in hearing that poem one discovers that <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> was under an impulse strong as that of the wind which drove the ship an impulse which while it would not suffer him to stop to add ornament to a single stanza filled him with force to achieve the whole with consummate perfection You managed to recite it with a steady voice <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I wonder thereat <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> s hand did not tremble in writing the lines Why should my voice falter in repeating them Depend on it <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> no tear blistered the manuscript of The Castaway I hear in it no sob of sorrow only the cry of despair but that cry uttered I believe the deadly spasm passed from his heart that he wept abundantly and was comforted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> resumed her ballad minstrelsy Stopping short she remarked ere long One could have loved <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> if it were only for the sake of having the privilege of comforting him You never would have loved <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> rejoined <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> promptly He was not made to be loved by woman What do you mean What I say I know there is a kind of natures in the world and very noble elevated natures too whom love never comes near You might have sought <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> with the intention of loving him and you would have looked at him pitied him and left him forced away by a sense of the impossible the incongruous as the crew were borne from their drowning comrade by the furious blast You may be right Who told you this And what I say of <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> I should say of <PERSON>Rousseau Was Rousseau</PERSON> ever loved He loved passionately but was his passion ever returned I am certain never And if there were any female Cowpers and Rousseaus I should assert the same of them Who told you this I ask Did <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Why should anybody have told me Have I not an instinct Can I not divine by analogy <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> never talked to me either about <PERSON>Cowper</PERSON> or <PERSON>Rousseau</PERSON> or love The voice we hear in solitude told me all I know on these subjects Do you like characters of the <PERSON>Rousseau</PERSON> order <PERSON>Caroline Not</PERSON> at all as a whole I sympathize intensely with certain qualities they possess Certain divine sparks in their nature dazzle my eyes and make my soul glow Then again I scorn them They are made of clay and gold The refuse and the ore make a mass of weakness taken altogether I feel them unnatural unhealthy repulsive I dare say I should be more tolerant of a <PERSON>Rousseau</PERSON> than you would <PERSON>Cary Submissive</PERSON> and contemplative yourself you like the stern and the practical By the way you must miss that Cousin <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of yours very much now that you and he never meet I do And he must miss you That he does not I cannot imagine pursued <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> who had lately got a habit of introducing <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s name into the conversation even when it seemed to have no business there I cannot imagine but that he was fond of you since he took so much notice of you talked to you and taught you so much He never was fond of me he never professed to be fond of me He took pains to prove that he only just tolerated me <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> determined not to err on the flattering side in estimating her cousin s regard for her always now habitually thought of it and mentioned it in the most scanty measure She had her own reasons for being less sanguine than ever in hopeful views of the future less indulgent to pleasurable retrospections of the past Of course then observed Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> you only just tolerated him in return <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> men and women are so different they are in such a different position Women have so few things to think about men so many You may have a friendship for a man while he is almost indifferent to you Much of what cheers your life may be dependent on him while not a feeling or interest of moment in his eyes may have reference to you <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> used to be in the habit of going to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> sometimes for a week or a fortnight together Well while he was away I found his absence a void There was something wanting <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> was duller Of course I had my usual occupations still I missed him As I sat by myself in the evenings I used to feel a strange certainty of conviction I cannot describe that if a magician or a genius had at that moment offered me Prince <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> s tube you remember it in the Arabian Nights and if with its aid I had been enabled to take a view of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> to see where he was how occupied I should have learned in a startling manner the width of the chasm which gaped between such as he and such as I I knew that however my thoughts might adhere to him his were effectually sundered from me <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> demanded Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> abruptly don t you wish you had a profession a trade I wish it fifty times a day As it is I often wonder what I came into the world for I long to have something absorbing and compulsory to fill my head and hands and to occupy my thoughts Can labour alone make a human being happy No but it can give varieties of pain and prevent us from breaking our hearts with a single tyrant master torture Besides successful labour has its recompense a vacant weary lonely hopeless life has none But hard labour and learned professions they say make women masculine coarse unwomanly And what does it signify whether unmarried and never to be married women are unattractive and inelegant or not Provided only they are decent decorous and neat it is enough The utmost which ought to be required of old maids in the way of appearance is that they should not absolutely offend men s eyes as they pass them in the street for the rest they should be allowed without too much scorn to be as absorbed grave plain looking and plain dressed as they please You might be an old maid yourself <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> you speak so earnestly I shall be one It is my destiny I will never marry a <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> or a Sykes and no one else will ever marry me Here fell a long pause <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> broke it Again the name by which she seemed bewitched was almost the first on her lips <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> did not <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> call you <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> sometimes Yes It is sometimes used as the abbreviation of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in his native country Well <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> do you remember my one day noticing an inequality in your hair a curl wanting on that right side and your telling me that it was <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s fault as he had once cut therefrom a long lock Yes If he is and always was as indifferent to you as you say why did he steal your hair I don t know yes I do It was my doing not his Everything of that sort always was my doing He was going from home to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> as usual and the night before he went I had found in his sister s workbox a lock of black hair a short round curl <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> told me it was her brother s and a keepsake He was sitting near the table I looked at his head He has plenty of hair on the temples were many such round curls I thought he could spare me one I knew I should like to have it and I asked for it He said on condition that he might have his choice of a tress from my head So he got one of my long locks of hair and I got one of his short ones I keep his but I dare say he has lost mine It was my doing and one of those silly deeds it distresses the heart and sets the face on fire to think of one of those small but sharp recollections that return lacerating your self respect like tiny penknives and forcing from your lips as you sit alone sudden insane sounding interjections <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I _do_ think myself a fool <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in some respects I _do_ despise myself But I said I would not make you my confessor for you cannot reciprocate foible for foible you are not weak How steadily you watch me now Turn aside your clear strong she eagle eye it is an insult to fix it on me thus What a study of character you are weak certainly but not in the sense you think Come in This was said in answer to a tap at the door Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> happened to be near it at the moment <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> at the other end of the room She saw a note put into <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s hands and heard the words From Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> ma am Bring candles said Miss <PERSON>Keeldar Caroline</PERSON> sat expectant A communication on business said the heiress but when candles were brought she neither opened nor read it The rector s <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> was presently announced and the rector s niece went home CHAPTER XIII FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS ON BUSINESS In <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s nature prevailed at times an easy indolence There were periods when she took delight in perfect vacancy of hand and eye moments when her thoughts her simple existence the fact of the world being around and heaven above her seemed to yield her such fullness of happiness that she did not need to lift a finger to increase the joy Often after an active morning she would spend a sunny afternoon in lying stirless on the turf at the foot of some tree of friendly umbrage No society did she need but that of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and it sufficed if she were within call no spectacle did she ask but that of the deep blue sky and such cloudlets as sailed afar and aloft across its span no sound but that of the bee s hum the leaf s whisper Her sole book in such hours was the dim chronicle of memory or the sibyl page of anticipation From her young eyes fell on each volume a glorious light to read by round her lips at moments played a smile which revealed glimpses of the tale or prophecy It was not sad not dark Fate had been benign to the blissful dreamer and promised to favour her yet again In her past were sweet passages in her future rosy hopes Yet one day when <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> drew near to rouse her thinking she had lain long enough behold as she looked down <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s cheek was wet as if with dew those fine eyes of hers shone humid and brimming <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> why do _you_ cry asked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> involuntarily laying stress on _you_ Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> smiled and turned her picturesque head towards the questioner Because it pleases me mightily to cry she said My heart is both sad and glad But why you good patient child why do you not bear me company I only weep tears delightful and soon wiped away you might weep gall if you choose Why should I weep gall Mateless solitary bird was the only answer And are not you too mateless <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> At heart no Oh who nestles there <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> But <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> only laughed gaily at this question and alertly started up I have dreamed she said a mere day dream certainly bright probably baseless Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was by this time free enough from illusions she took a sufficiently grave view of the future and fancied she knew pretty well how her own destiny and that of some others were tending Yet old associations retained their influence over her and it was these and the power of habit which still frequently drew her of an evening to the field style and the old thorn overlooking the Hollow One night the night after the incident of the note she had been at her usual post watching for her beacon watching vainly that evening no lamp was lit She waited till the rising of certain constellations warned her of lateness and signed her away In passing Fieldhead on her return its moonlight beauty attracted her glance and stayed her step an instant Tree and hall rose peaceful under the night sky and clear full orb pearly paleness gilded the building mellow brown gloom bosomed it round shadows of deep green brooded above its oak wreathed roof The broad pavement in front shone pale also it gleamed as if some spell had transformed the dark granite to glistering Parian On the silvery space slept two sable shadows thrown sharply defined from two human figures These figures when first seen were motionless and mute presently they moved in harmonious step and spoke low in harmonious key <LOCATION>Earnest</LOCATION> was the gaze that scrutinized them as they emerged from behind the trunk of the cedar Is it Mrs Pryor and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Certainly it is <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Who else has a shape so lithe and proud and graceful And her face too is visible her countenance careless and pensive and musing and mirthful and mocking and tender Not fearing the dew she has not covered her head her curls are free they veil her neck and caress her shoulder with their tendril rings An ornament of gold gleams through the half closed folds of the scarf she has wrapped across her bust and a large bright gem glitters on the white hand which confines it Yes that is <PERSON>Shirley Her</PERSON> companion then is of course Mrs Pryor Yes if <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> owns six feet of stature and if she has changed her decent widow s weeds for masculine disguise The figure walking at Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s side is a man a tall young stately man it is her tenant <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> The pair speak softly their words are not distinguishable To remain a moment to gaze is not to be an eavesdropper and as the moon shines so clearly and their countenances are so distinctly apparent who can resist the attraction of such interest <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> it seems cannot for she lingers There was a time when on summer nights <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had been wont to walk with his cousin as he was now walking with the heiress Often had she gone up the Hollow with him after sunset to scent the freshness of the earth where a growth of fragrant herbage carpeted a certain narrow terrace edging a deep ravine from whose rifted gloom was heard a sound like the spirit of the lonely watercourse moaning amongst its wet stones and between its weedy banks and under its dark bower of alders But I used to be closer to him thought <PERSON>Caroline He</PERSON> felt no obligation to treat me with homage I needed only kindness He used to hold my hand he does not touch hers And yet <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> is not proud where she loves There is no haughtiness in her aspect now only a little in her port what is natural to and inseparable from her what she retains in her most careless as in her most guarded moments <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> must think as I think that he is at this instant looking down on a fine face and he must think it with a man s brain not with mine She has such generous yet soft fire in her eyes She smiles what makes her smile so sweet I saw that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> felt its beauty and he must have felt it with his man s heart not with my dim woman s perceptions They look to me like two great happy spirits Yonder silvered pavement reminds me of that white shore we believe to be beyond the death flood They have reached it they walk there united And what am I standing here in shadow shrinking into concealment my mind darker than my hiding place I am one of this world no spirit a poor doomed mortal who asks in ignorance and hopelessness wherefore she was born to what end she lives whose mind for ever runs on the question how she shall at last encounter and by whom be sustained through death This is the worst passage I have come to yet still I was quite prepared for it I gave <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> up and gave him up to <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> the first day I heard she was come the first moment I saw her rich youthful and lovely She has him now He is her lover She is his darling She will be far more his darling yet when they are married The more <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> knows of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> the more his soul will cleave to her They will both be happy and I do not grudge them their bliss but I groan under my own misery Some of my suffering is very acute Truly I ought not to have been born they should have smothered me at the first cry Here <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> stepping aside to gather a dewy flower she and her companion turned into a path that lay nearer the gate Some of their conversation became audible <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> would not stay to listen She passed away noiselessly and the moonlight kissed the wall which her shadow had dimmed The reader is privileged to remain and try what he can make of the discourse I cannot conceive why nature did not give you a bulldog s head for you have all a bulldog s tenacity said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Not a flattering idea Am I so ignoble And something also you have of the same animal s silent ways of going about its work You give no warning you come noiselessly behind seize fast and hold on This is guess work You have witnessed no such feat on my part In your presence I have been no bulldog Your very silence indicates your race How little you talk in general yet how deeply you scheme You are far seeing you are calculating I know the ways of these people I have gathered information of their intentions My note last night informed you that <PERSON>Barraclough</PERSON> s trial had ended in his conviction and sentence to transportation His associates will plot vengeance I shall lay my plans so as to counteract or at least be prepared for theirs that is all Having now given you as clear an explanation as I can am I to understand that for what I propose doing I have your approbation I shall stand by you so long as you remain on the defensive Yes Good Without any aid even opposed or disapproved by you I believe I should have acted precisely as I now intend to act but in another spirit I now feel satisfied On the whole I relish the position I dare say you do That is evident You relish the work which lies before you still better than you would relish the execution of a government order for army cloth I certainly feel it congenial So would old Helstone It is true there is a shade of difference in your motives many shades perhaps Shall I speak to Mr Helstone I will if you like Act as you please Your judgment Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> will guide you accurately I could rely on it myself in a more difficult crisis But I should inform you Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> is somewhat prejudiced against me at present I am aware I have heard all about your differences Depend upon it they will melt away He cannot resist the temptation of an alliance under present circumstances I should be glad to have him he is of true metal I think so also An old blade and rusty somewhat but the edge and temper still excellent Well you shall have him Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> that is if I can win him Whom can you not win Perhaps not the rector but I will make the effort Effort He will yield for a word a smile By no means It will cost me several cups of tea some toast and cake and an ample measure of remonstrances expostulations and persuasions It grows rather chill I perceive you shiver Am I acting wrongly to detain you here Yet it is so calm I even feel it warm and society such as yours is a pleasure to me so rare If you were wrapped in a thicker shawl I might stay longer and forget how late it is which would chagrin Mrs Pryor We keep early and regular hours at Fieldhead Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and so I am sure does your sister at the cottage Yes but <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> and I have an understanding the most convenient in the world that we shall each do as we please How do you please to do Three nights in the week I sleep in the mill but I require little rest and when it is moonlight and mild I often haunt the Hollow till daybreak When I was a very little girl Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> my nurse used to tell me tales of fairies being seen in that Hollow That was before my father built the mill when it was a perfectly solitary ravine You will be falling under enchantment I fear it is done said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> in a low voice But there are worse things than fairies to be guarded against pursued Miss Keeldar Things more perilous he subjoined Far more so For instance how would you like to meet <PERSON>Michael Hartley</PERSON> that mad Calvinist and Jacobin weaver They say he is addicted to poaching and often goes abroad at night with his gun I have already had the luck to meet him We held a long argument together one night A strange little incident it was I liked it Liked it I admire your taste <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> is not sane Where did you meet him In the deepest shadiest spot in the glen where the water runs low under brushwood We sat down near that plank bridge It was moonlight but clouded and very windy We had a talk On politics And religion I think the moon was at the full and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was as near crazed as possible He uttered strange blasphemy in his Antinomian fashion Excuse me but I think you must have been nearly as mad as he to sit listening to him There is a wild interest in his ravings The man would be half a poet if he were not wholly a maniac and perhaps a prophet if he were not a profligate He solemnly informed me that hell was foreordained my inevitable portion that he read the mark of the beast on my brow that I had been an outcast from the beginning God s vengeance he said was preparing for me and affirmed that in a vision of the night he had beheld the manner and the instrument of my doom I wanted to know further but he left me with these words The end is not yet Have you ever seen him since About a month afterwards in returning from market I encountered him and <PERSON>Moses Barraclough</PERSON> both in an advanced stage of inebriation They were praying in frantic sort at the roadside They accosted me as Satan bid me avaunt and clamoured to be delivered from temptation Again but a few days ago <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> took the trouble of appearing at the counting house door hatless in his shirt sleeves his coat and castor having been detained at the public house in pledge He delivered himself of the comfortable message that he could wish Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to set his house in order as his soul was likely shortly to be required of him Do you make light of these things The poor man had been drinking for weeks and was in a state bordering on delirium tremens What then He is the more likely to attempt the fulfilment of his own prophecies It would not do to permit incidents of this sort to affect one s nerves Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> go home So soon Pass straight down the fields not round by the lade and plantations It is early yet It is late For my part I am going in Will you promise me not to wander in the Hollow to night If you wish it I do wish it May I ask whether you consider life valueless By no means On the contrary of late I regard my life as invaluable Of late Existence is neither aimless nor hopeless to me now and it was both three months ago I was then drowning and rather wished the operation over All at once a hand was stretched to me such a delicate hand I scarcely dared trust it its strength however has rescued me from ruin Are you really rescued For the time Your assistance has given me another chance Live to make the best of it <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t offer yourself as a target to <PERSON>Michael Hartley</PERSON> and good night Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was under a promise to spend the evening of the next day at Fieldhead She kept her promise Some gloomy hours had she spent in the interval Most of the time had been passed shut up in her own apartment only issuing from it indeed to join her uncle at meals and anticipating inquiries from <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> by telling her that she was busy altering a dress and preferred sewing upstairs to avoid interruption She did sew She plied her needle continuously ceaselessly but her brain worked faster than her fingers Again and more intensely than ever she desired a fixed occupation no matter how onerous how irksome Her uncle must be once more entreated but first she would consult Mrs Pryor Her head laboured to frame projects as diligently as her hands to plait and stitch the thin texture of the muslin summer dress spread on the little white couch at the foot of which she sat Now and then while thus doubly occupied a tear would fill her eyes and fall on her busy hands but this sign of emotion was rare and quickly effaced The sharp pang passed the dimness cleared from her vision She would re thread her needle rearrange tuck and trimming and work on Late in the afternoon she dressed herself She reached <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> and appeared in the oak parlour just as tea was brought in <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> asked her why she came so late Because I have been making my dress said she These fine sunny days began to make me ashamed of my winter merino so I have furbished up a lighter garment In which you look as I like to see you said <PERSON>Shirley You</PERSON> are a lady like little person <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> Is she not Mrs Pryor Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> never paid compliments and seldom indulged in remarks favourable or otherwise on personal appearance On the present occasion she only swept <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s curls from her cheek as she took a seat near her caressed the oval outline and observed You get somewhat thin my love and somewhat pale Do you sleep well your eyes have a languid look And she gazed at her anxiously I sometimes dream melancholy dreams answered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and if I lie awake for an hour or two in the night I am continually thinking of the rectory as a dreary old place You know it is very near the churchyard The back part of the house is extremely ancient and it is said that the out kitchens there were once enclosed in the churchyard and that there are graves under them I rather long to leave the rectory My dear you are surely not superstitious No <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> but I think I grow what is called nervous I see things under a darker aspect than I used to do I have fears I never used to have not of ghosts but of omens and disastrous events and I have an inexpressible weight on my mind which I would give the world to shake off and I cannot do it Strange cried <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I never feel so <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> said nothing Fine weather pleasant days pleasant scenes are powerless to give me pleasure continued <PERSON>Caroline Calm</PERSON> evenings are not calm to me Moonlight which I used to think mild now only looks mournful Is this weakness of mind <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> or what is it I cannot help it I often struggle against it I reason but reason and effort make no difference You should take more exercise said Mrs Pryor Exercise I exercise sufficiently I exercise till I am ready to drop My dear you should go from home Mrs Pryor I should like to go from home but not on any purposeless excursion or visit I wish to be a governess as you have been It would oblige me greatly if you would speak to my uncle on the subject Nonsense broke in <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> What an idea Be a governess Better be a slave at once Where is the necessity of it Why should you dream of such a painful step My dear said <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> you are very young to be a governess and not sufficiently robust The duties a governess undertakes are often severe And I believe I want severe duties to occupy me Occupy you cried <PERSON>Shirley When</PERSON> are you idle I never saw a more industrious girl than you You are always at work Come she continued come and sit by my side and take some tea to refresh you You don t care much for my friendship then that you wish to leave me Indeed I do <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and I don t wish to leave you I shall never find another friend so dear At which words Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> put her hand into <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s with an impulsively affectionate movement which was well seconded by the expression of her face If you think so you had better make much of me she said and not run away from me I hate to part with those to whom I am become attached <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> there sometimes talks of leaving me and says I might make a more advantageous connection than herself I should as soon think of exchanging an old fashioned mother for something modish and stylish As for you why I began to flatter myself we were thoroughly friends that you liked <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> almost as well as <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> likes you and she does not stint her regard I _do_ like <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I like her more and more every day But that does not make me strong or happy And would it make you strong or happy to go and live as a dependent amongst utter strangers It would not And the experiment must not be tried I tell you it would fail It is not in your nature to bear the desolate life governesses generally lead you would fall ill I won t hear of it And Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> paused having uttered this prohibition very decidedly Soon she recommenced still looking somewhat _courrouc e_ Why it is my daily pleasure now to look out for the little cottage bonnet and the silk scarf glancing through the trees in the lane and to know that my quiet shrewd thoughtful companion and monitress is coming back to me that I shall have her sitting in the room to look at to talk to or to let alone as she and I please This may be a selfish sort of language I know it is but it is the language which naturally rises to my lips therefore I utter it I would write to you <PERSON>Shirley And</PERSON> what are letters Only a sort of _pis aller_ Drink some tea Caroline Eat something you eat nothing Laugh and be cheerful and stay at home Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> shook her head and sighed She felt what difficulty she would have to persuade any one to assist or sanction her in making that change in her life which she believed desirable Might she only follow her own judgment she thought she should be able to find perhaps a harsh but an effectual cure for her sufferings But this judgment founded on circumstances she could fully explain to none least of all to <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> seemed in all eyes but her own incomprehensible and fantastic and was opposed accordingly There really was no present pecuniary need for her to leave a comfortable home and take a situation and there was every probability that her uncle might in some way permanently provide for her So her friends thought and as far as their lights enabled them to see they reasoned correctly but of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s strange sufferings which she desired so eagerly to overcome or escape they had no idea of her racked nights and dismal days no suspicion It was at once impossible and hopeless to explain to wait and endure was her only plan Many that want food and clothing have cheerier lives and brighter prospects than she had many harassed by poverty are in a strait less afflictive Now is your mind quieted inquired <PERSON>Shirley Will</PERSON> you consent to stay at home I shall not leave it against the approbation of my friends was the reply but I think in time they will be obliged to think as I do During this conversation Mrs Pryor looked far from easy Her extreme habitual reserve would rarely permit her to talk freely or to interrogate others closely She could think a multitude of questions she never ventured to put give advice in her mind which her tongue never delivered Had she been alone with <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> she might possibly have said something to the point Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s presence accustomed as she was to it sealed her lips Now as on a thousand other occasions inexplicable nervous scruples kept her back from interfering She merely showed her concern for Miss Helstone in an indirect way by asking her if the fire made her too warm placing a screen between her chair and the hearth closing a window whence she imagined a draught proceeded and often and restlessly glancing at her <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> resumed Having destroyed your plan she said which I hope I have done I shall construct a new one of my own Every summer I make an excursion This season I propose spending two months either at the Scotch lochs or the English lakes that is I shall go there provided you consent to accompany me If you refuse I shall not stir a foot You are very good <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I would be very good if you would let me I have every disposition to be good It is my misfortune and habit I know to think of myself paramount to anybody else but who is not like me in that respect However when Captain <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> is made comfortable accommodated with all he wants including a sensible genial comrade it gives him a thorough pleasure to devote his spare efforts to making that comrade happy And should we not be happy <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in the Highlands We will go to the Highlands We will if you can bear a sea voyage go to the <LOCATION>Isles</LOCATION> the Hebrides the <LOCATION>Shetland the Orkney Islands</LOCATION> Would you not like that I see you would Mrs Pryor I call you to witness Her face is all sunshine at the bare mention of it I should like it much returned <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to whom indeed the notion of such a tour was not only pleasant but gloriously reviving <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> rubbed her hands Come I can bestow a benefit she exclaimed I can do a good deed with my cash My thousand a year is not merely a matter of dirty bank notes and jaundiced guineas let me speak respectfully of both though for I adore them but it may be health to the drooping strength to the weak consolation to the sad I was determined to make something of it better than a fine old house to live in than satin gowns to wear better than deference from acquaintance and homage from the poor Here is to begin This summer <PERSON>Caroline Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and I go out into the <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION> beyond the <LOCATION>Shetland</LOCATION> perhaps to the <LOCATION>Faroe Isles</LOCATION> We will see seals in <LOCATION>Suderoe</LOCATION> and doubtless mermaids in <LOCATION>Stromoe Caroline</LOCATION> is laughing Mrs Pryor _I_ made her laugh _I_ have done her good I shall like to go <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> again said Miss Helstone I long to hear the sound of waves ocean waves and to see them as I have imagined them in dreams like tossing banks of green light strewed with vanishing and reappearing wreaths of foam whiter than lilies I shall delight to pass the shores of those lone rock islets where the sea birds live and breed unmolested We shall be on the track of the old Scandinavians of the Norsemen We shall almost see the shores of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> This is a very vague delight that I feel communicated by your proposal but it _is_ a delight Will you think of Fitful Head now when you lie awake at night of gulls shrieking round it and waves tumbling in upon it rather than of the graves under the rectory back kitchen I will try and instead of musing about remnants of shrouds and fragments of coffins and human bones and mould I will fancy seals lying in the sunshine on solitary shores where neither fisherman nor hunter ever come of rock crevices full of pearly eggs bedded in seaweed of unscared birds covering white sands in happy flocks And what will become of that inexpressible weight you said you had on your mind I will try to forget it in speculation on the sway of the whole great deep above a herd of whales rushing through the livid and liquid thunder down from the frozen zone a hundred of them perhaps wallowing flashing rolling in the wake of a patriarch bull huge enough to have been spawned before the Flood such a creature as poor Smart had in his mind when he said Strong against tides the enormous whale Emerges as he goes I hope our bark will meet with no such shoal or herd as you term it <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I suppose you fancy the sea mammoths pasturing about the bases of the everlasting hills devouring strange provender in the vast valleys through and above which sea billows roll I should not like to be capsized by the patriarch bull I suppose you expect to see mermaids <PERSON>Shirley One</PERSON> of them at any rate I do not bargain for less and she is to appear in some such fashion as this I am to be walking by myself on deck rather late of an August evening watching and being watched by a full harvest moon Something is to rise white on the surface of the sea over which that moon mounts silent and hangs glorious The object glitters and sinks It rises again I think I hear it cry with an articulate voice I call you up from the cabin I show you an image fair as alabaster emerging from the dim wave We both see the long hair the lifted and foam white arm the oval mirror brilliant as a star It glides nearer a human face is plainly visible a face in the style of yours whose straight pure excuse the word it is appropriate whose straight pure lineaments paleness does not disfigure It looks at us but not with your eyes I see a preternatural lure in its wily glance It beckons Were we men we should spring at the sign the cold billow would be dared for the sake of the colder enchantress being women we stand safe though not dreadless She comprehends our unmoved gaze she feels herself powerless anger crosses her front she cannot charm but she will appal us she rises high and glides all revealed on the dark wave ridge Temptress terror monstrous likeness of ourselves Are you not glad <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when at last and with a wild shriek she dives But <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> she is not like us We are neither temptresses nor terrors nor monsters Some of our kind it is said are all three There are men who ascribe to woman in general such attributes My dears here interrupted <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> does it not strike you that your conversation for the last ten minutes has been rather fanciful But there is no harm in our fancies is there ma am We are aware that mermaids do not exist why speak of them as if they did How can you find interest in speaking of a nonentity I don t know said <PERSON>Shirley My dear</PERSON> I think there is an arrival I heard a step in the lane while you were talking and is not that the garden gate which creaks <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> stepped to the window Yes there is some one said she turning quietly away and as she resumed her seat a sensitive flush animated her face while a trembling ray at once kindled and softened her eye She raised her hand to her chin cast her gaze down and seemed to think as she waited The servant announced Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> turned round when Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> appeared at the door His figure seemed very tall as he entered and stood in contrast with the three ladies none of whom could boast a stature much beyond the average He was looking well better than he had been known to look for the past twelve months A sort of renewed youth glowed in his eye and colour and an invigorated hope and settled purpose sustained his bearing Firmness his countenance still indicated but not austerity It looked as cheerful as it was earnest I am just returned from <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> he said to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> as he greeted her and I thought I would call to impart to you the result of my mission You did right not to keep me in suspense she said and your visit is well timed Sit down We have not finished tea Are you English enough to relish tea or do you faithfully adhere to coffee <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> accepted tea I am learning to be a naturalized Englishman said he my foreign habits are leaving me one by one And now he paid his respects to <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and paid them well with a grave modesty that became his age compared with hers Then he looked at <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> not however for the first time his glance had fallen upon her before He bent towards her as she sat gave her his hand and asked her how she was The light from the window did not fall upon Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> her back was turned towards it A quiet though rather low reply a still demeanour and the friendly protection of early twilight kept out of view each traitorous symptom None could affirm that she had trembled or blushed that her heart had quaked or her nerves thrilled none could prove emotion a greeting showing less effusion was never interchanged <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> took the empty chair near her opposite Miss Keeldar He had placed himself well His neighbour screened by the very closeness of his vicinage from his scrutiny and sheltered further by the dusk which deepened each moment soon regained not merely _seeming_ but _real_ mastery of the feelings which had started into insurrection at the first announcement of his name He addressed his conversation to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> I went to the barracks he said and had an interview with Colonel <PERSON>Ryde</PERSON> He approved my plans and promised the aid I wanted Indeed he offered a more numerous force than I require half a dozen will suffice I don t intend to be swamped by redcoats They are needed for appearance rather than anything else My main reliance is on my own civilians And on their captain interposed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> What Captain <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> inquired <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> slightly smiling and not lifting his eyes The tone of raillery in which he said this was very respectful and suppressed No returned <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> answering the smile Captain <PERSON>G rard Moore</PERSON> who trusts much to the prowess of his own right arm I believe Furnished with his counting house ruler added <PERSON>Moore Resuming</PERSON> his usual gravity he went on I received by this evening s post a note from the Home Secretary in answer to mine It appears they are uneasy at the state of matters here in the north they especially condemn the supineness and pusillanimity of the mill owners They say as I have always said that inaction under present circumstances is criminal and that cowardice is cruelty since both can only encourage disorder and lead finally to sanguinary outbreaks There is the note I brought it for your perusal and there is a batch of newspapers containing further accounts of proceedings in <LOCATION>Nottingham Manchester</LOCATION> and elsewhere He produced letters and journals and laid them before Miss Keeldar While she perused them he took his tea quietly but though his tongue was still his observant faculties seemed by no means off duty Mrs Pryor sitting in the background did not come within the range of his glance but the two younger ladies had the full benefit thereof Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> placed directly opposite was seen without effort She was the object his eyes when lifted naturally met first and as what remained of daylight the gilding of the west was upon her her shape rose in relief from the dark panelling behind <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s clear cheek was tinted yet with the colour which had risen into it a few minutes since The dark lashes of her eyes looking down as she read the dusk yet delicate line of her eyebrows the almost sable gloss of her curls made her heightened complexion look fine as the bloom of a red wild flower by contrast There was natural grace in her attitude and there was artistic effect in the ample and shining folds of her silk dress an attire simply fashioned but almost splendid from the shifting brightness of its dye warp and woof being of tints deep and changing as the hue on a pheasant s neck A glancing bracelet on her arm produced the contrast of gold and ivory There was something brilliant in the whole picture It is to be supposed that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> thought so as his eye dwelt long on it but he seldom permitted his feelings or his opinions to exhibit themselves in his face His temperament boasted a certain amount of phlegm and he preferred an undemonstrative not ungentle but serious aspect to any other He could not by looking straight before him see <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as she was close at his side It was necessary therefore to man uvre a little to get her well within the range of his observation He leaned back in his chair and looked down on her In Miss Helstone neither he nor any one else could discover brilliancy Sitting in the shade without flowers or ornaments her attire the modest muslin dress colourless but for its narrow stripe of pale azure her complexion unflushed unexcited the very brownness of her hair and eyes invisible by this faint light she was compared with the heiress as a graceful pencil sketch compared with a vivid painting Since <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> had seen her last a great change had been wrought in her Whether he perceived it might not be ascertained He said nothing to that effect How is <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> softly Very well but she complains of being unemployed She misses you Tell her that I miss her and that I write and read a portion of French every day She will ask if you sent your love she is always particular on that point You know she likes attention My best love my very best And say to her that whenever she has time to write me a little note I shall be glad to hear from her What if I forget I am not the surest messenger of compliments No don t forget <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> It is no compliment it is in good earnest And must therefore be delivered punctually If you please <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> will be ready to shed tears She is tenderhearted on the subject of her pupil yet she reproaches you sometimes for obeying your uncle s injunctions too literally Affection like love will be unjust now and then And <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> made no answer to this observation for indeed her heart was troubled and to her eyes she would have raised her handkerchief if she had dared If she had dared too she would have declared how the very flowers in the garden of Hollow s Cottage were dear to her how the little parlour of that house was her earthly paradise how she longed to return to it as much almost as the first woman in her exile must have longed to revisit Eden Not daring however to say these things she held her peace she sat quiet at <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s side waiting for him to say something more It was long since this proximity had been hers long since his voice had addressed her could she with any show of probability even of possibility have imagined that the meeting gave him pleasure to her it would have given deep bliss Yet even in doubt that it pleased in dread that it might annoy him she received the boon of the meeting as an imprisoned bird would the admission of sunshine to its cage It was of no use arguing contending against the sense of present happiness to be near <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was to be revived Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> laid down the papers And are you glad or sad for all these menacing tidings she inquired of her tenant Not precisely either but I certainly am instructed I see that our only plan is to be firm I see that efficient preparation and a resolute attitude are the best means of averting bloodshed He then inquired if she had observed some particular paragraph to which she replied in the negative and he rose to show it to her He continued the conversation standing before her From the tenor of what he said it appeared evident that they both apprehended disturbances in the neighbourhood of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> though in what form they expected them to break out was not specified Neither <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> asked questions The subject did not appear to be regarded as one ripe for free discussion therefore the lady and her tenant were suffered to keep details to themselves unimportuned by the curiosity of their listeners Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> in speaking to Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> took a tone at once animated and dignified confidential and self respecting When however the candles were brought in and the fire was stirred up and the fullness of light thus produced rendered the expression of her countenance legible you could see that she was all interest life and earnestness There was nothing coquettish in her demeanour whatever she felt for <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> she felt it seriously And serious too were his feelings and settled were his views apparently for he made no petty effort to attract dazzle or impress He contrived notwithstanding to command a little because the deeper voice however mildly modulated the somewhat harder mind now and then though involuntarily and unintentionally bore down by some peremptory phrase or tone the mellow accents and susceptible if high nature of <PERSON>Shirley Miss Keeldar</PERSON> looked happy in conversing with him and her joy seemed twofold a joy of the past and present of memory and of hope What I have just said are <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s ideas of the pair She felt what has just been described In thus feeling she tried not to suffer but suffered sharply nevertheless She suffered indeed miserably A few minutes before her famished heart had tasted a drop and crumb of nourishment that if freely given would have brought back abundance of life where life was failing but the generous feast was snatched from her spread before another and she remained but a bystander at the banquet The clock struck nine it was <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s time for going home She gathered up her work put the embroidery the scissors the thimble into her bag She bade <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> a quiet good night receiving from that lady a warmer pressure of the hand than usual She stepped up to Miss Keeldar Good night <PERSON>Shirley Shirley</PERSON> started up What so soon Are you going already It is past nine I never heard the clock You will come again to morrow and you will be happy to night will you not Remember our plans Yes said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I have not forgotten Her mind misgave her that neither those plans nor any other could permanently restore her mental tranquillity She turned to <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> who stood close behind her As he looked up the light of the candles on the mantelpiece fell full on her face All its paleness all its change all its forlorn meaning were clearly revealed <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> had good eyes and might have seen it if he would whether he did see it nothing indicated Good night she said shaking like a leaf offering her thin hand hastily anxious to part from him quickly You are going home he asked not touching her hand Yes Is Fanny come for you Yes I may as well accompany you a step of the way not up to the rectory though lest my old friend <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> should shoot me from the window He laughed and took his hat <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> spoke of unnecessary trouble he told her to put on her bonnet and shawl She was quickly ready and they were soon both in the open air <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> drew her hand under his arm just in his old manner that manner which she ever felt to be so kind You may run on Fanny he said to the housemaid we shall overtake you And when the girl had got a little in advance he enclosed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s hand in his and said he was glad to find she was a familiar guest at Fieldhead He hoped her intimacy with Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> would continue such society would be both pleasant and improving <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> replied that she liked <PERSON>Shirley And</PERSON> there is no doubt the liking is mutual said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> If she professes friendship be certain she is sincere She cannot feign she scorns hypocrisy And <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> are we never to see you at Hollow s Cottage again I suppose not unless my uncle should change his mind Are you much alone now Yes a good deal I have little pleasure in any society but Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s Have you been quite well lately Quite You must take care of yourself Be sure not to neglect exercise Do you know I fancied you somewhat altered a little fallen away and pale Is your uncle kind to you Yes he is just as he always is Not too tender that is to say not too protective and attentive And what ails you then Tell me <PERSON>Lina Nothing Robert</PERSON> But her voice faltered That is to say nothing that you will tell me I am not to be taken into confidence Separation is then quite to estrange us is it I do not know Sometimes I almost fear it is But it ought not to have that effect Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days o lang syne <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I don t forget It is two months I should think <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> since you were at the cottage Since I was _within_ it yes Have you ever passed that way in your walk I have come to the top of the fields sometimes of an evening and looked down Once I saw <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> in the garden watering her flowers and I know at what time you light your lamp in the counting house I have waited for it to shine out now and then and I have seen you bend between it and the window I knew it was you I could almost trace the outline of your form I wonder I never encountered you I occasionally walk to the top of the Hollow s fields after sunset I know you do I had almost spoken to you one night you passed so near me Did I I passed near you and did not see you Was I alone I saw you twice and neither time were you alone Who was my companion Probably nothing but <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> or my own shadow by moonlight No neither <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> nor your shadow <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> The first time you were with Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and the second time what you call your shadow was a shape with a white forehead and dark curls and a sparkling necklace round its neck But I only just got a glimpse of you and that fairy shadow I did not wait to hear you converse It appears you walk invisible I noticed a ring on your hand this evening can it be the ring of Gyges Henceforth when sitting in the counting house by myself perhaps at dead of night I shall permit myself to imagine that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> may be leaning over my shoulder reading with me from the same book or sitting at my side engaged in her own particular task and now and then raising her unseen eyes to my face to read there my thoughts You need fear no such infliction I do not come near you I only stand afar off watching what may become of you When I walk out along the hedgerows in the evening after the mill is shut or at night when I take the watchman s place I shall fancy the flutter of every little bird over its nest the rustle of every leaf a movement made by you tree shadows will take your shape in the white sprays of hawthorn I shall imagine glimpses of you <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> you will haunt me I will never be where you would not wish me to be nor see nor hear what you would wish unseen and unheard I shall see you in my very mill in broad daylight Indeed I have seen you there once But a week ago I was standing at the top of one of my long rooms girls were working at the other end and amongst half a dozen of them moving to and fro I seemed to see a figure resembling yours It was some effect of doubtful light or shade or of dazzling sunbeam I walked up to this group What I sought had glided away I found myself between two buxom lasses in pinafores I shall not follow you into your mill <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> unless you call me there Nor is that the only occasion on which imagination has played me a trick One night when I came home late from market I walked into the cottage parlour thinking to find <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> but instead of her I thought I found you There was no candle in the room my sister had taken the light upstairs with her The window blind was not drawn and broad moonbeams poured through the panes There you were <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> at the casement shrinking a little to one side in an attitude not unusual with you You were dressed in white as I have seen you dressed at an evening party For half a second your fresh living face seemed turned towards me looking at me for half a second my idea was to go and take your hand to chide you for your long absence and welcome your present visit Two steps forward broke the spell The drapery of the dress changed outline the tints of the complexion dissolved and were formless Positively as I reached the spot there was nothing left but the sweep of a white muslin curtain and a balsam plant in a flower pot covered with a flush of bloom Sic transit et cetera It was not my wraith then I almost thought it was No only gauze crockery and pink blossom a sample of earthly illusions I wonder you have time for such illusions occupied as your mind must be So do I But I find in myself <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> two natures one for the world and business and one for home and leisure G rard <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is a hard dog brought up to mill and market the person you call your cousin <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is sometimes a dreamer who lives elsewhere than in Cloth hall and counting house Your two natures agree with you I think you are looking in good spirits and health You have quite lost that harassed air which it often pained one to see in your face a few months ago Do you observe that Certainly I am disentangled of some difficulties I have got clear of some shoals and have more sea room And with a fair wind you may now hope to make a prosperous voyage I may _hope_ it yes but hope is deceptive There is no controlling wind or wave Gusts and swells perpetually trouble the mariner s course he dare not dismiss from his mind the expectation of tempest But you are ready for a breeze you are a good seaman an able commander You are a skilful pilot <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> you will weather the storm My kinswoman always thinks the best of me but I will take her words for a propitious omen I will consider that in meeting her to night I have met with one of those birds whose appearance is to the sailor the harbinger of good luck A poor harbinger of good luck is she who can do nothing who has no power I feel my incapacity It is of no use saying I have the will to serve you when I cannot prove it Yet I have that will I wish you success I wish you high fortune and true happiness When did you ever wish me anything else What is <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> waiting for I told her to walk on Oh we have reached the churchyard Then we are to part here I suppose We might have sat a few minutes in the church porch if the girl had not been with us It is so fine a night so summer mild and still I have no particular wish to return yet to the Hollow But we cannot sit in the porch now <PERSON>Robert Caroline</PERSON> said this because <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was turning her round towards it Perhaps not But tell <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> to go in Say we are coming A few minutes will make no difference The church clock struck ten My uncle will be coming out to take his usual sentinel round and he always surveys the church and churchyard And if he does If it were not for <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> who knows we are here I should find pleasure in dodging and eluding him We could be under the east window when he is at the porch as he came round to the north side we could wheel off to the south we might at a pinch hide behind some of the monuments That tall erection of the <LOCATION>Wynnes</LOCATION> would screen us completely <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> what good spirits you have Go go added <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> hastily I hear the front door I don t want to go on the contrary I want to stay You know my uncle will be terribly angry He forbade me to see you because you are a Jacobin A queer Jacobin Go <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> he is coming I hear him cough Diable It is strange what a pertinacious wish I feel to stay You remember what he did to <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> s began <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and stopped abruptly short Sweetheart was the word that ought to have followed but she could not utter it It seemed calculated to suggest ideas she had no intention to suggest ideas delusive and disturbing <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was less scrupulous <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> s sweetheart he said at once He gave him a shower bath under the pump did he not He d do as much for me I dare say with pleasure I should like to provoke the old Turk not however against you But he would make a distinction between a cousin and a lover would he not Oh he would not think of you in that way of course not his quarrel with you is entirely political Yet I should not like the breach to be widened and he is so testy Here he is at the garden gate For your own sake and mine <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> go The beseeching words were aided by a beseeching gesture and a more beseeching look <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> covered her clasped hands an instant with his answered her upward by a downward gaze said Good night and went <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was in a moment at the kitchen door behind Fanny The shadow of the shovel hat at that very instant fell on a moonlit tomb The rector emerged erect as a cane from his garden and proceeded in slow march his hands behind him down the cemetery <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was almost caught He had to dodge after all to coast round the church and finally to bend his tall form behind the Wynnes ambitious monument There he was forced to hide full ten minutes kneeling with one knee on the turf his hat off his curls bare to the dew his dark eye shining and his lips parted with inward laughter at his position for the rector meantime stood coolly star gazing and taking snuff within three feet of him It happened however that Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> had no suspicion whatever on his mind for being usually but vaguely informed of his niece s movements not thinking it worth while to follow them closely he was not aware that she had been out at all that day and imagined her then occupied with book or work in her chamber where indeed she was by this time though not absorbed in the tranquil employment he ascribed to her but standing at her window with fast throbbing heart peeping anxiously from behind the blind watching for her uncle to re enter and her cousin to escape And at last she was gratified She heard Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> come in she saw <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> stride the tombs and vault the wall she then went down to prayers When she returned to her chamber it was to meet the memory of <PERSON>Robert Slumber</PERSON> s visitation was long averted Long she sat at her lattice long gazed down on the old garden and older church on the tombs laid out all gray and calm and clear in moonlight She followed the steps of the night on its pathway of stars far into the wee sma hours ayont the twal She was with <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> in spirit the whole time she was at his side she heard his voice she gave her hand into his hand it rested warm in his fingers When the church clock struck when any other sound stirred when a little mouse familiar to her chamber an intruder for which she would never permit <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> to lay a trap came rattling amongst the links of her locket chain her one ring and another trinket or two on the toilet table to nibble a bit of biscuit laid ready for it she looked up recalled momentarily to the real Then she said half aloud as if deprecating the accusation of some unseen and unheard monitor I am not cherishing love dreams I am only thinking because I cannot sleep Of course I know he will marry <PERSON>Shirley With</PERSON> returning silence with the lull of the chime and the retreat of her small untamed and unknown _prot g _ she still resumed the dream nestling to the vision s side listening to conversing with it It paled at last As dawn approached the setting stars and breaking day dimmed the creation of fancy the wakened song of birds hushed her whispers The tale full of fire quick with interest borne away by the morning wind became a vague murmur The shape that seen in a moonbeam lived had a pulse had movement wore health s glow and youth s freshness turned cold and ghostly gray confronted with the red of sunrise It wasted She was left solitary at last She crept to her couch chill and dejected CHAPTER XIV <PERSON>SHIRLEY</PERSON> SEEKS TO BE SAVED BY WORKS Of course I know he will marry <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> were her first words when she rose in the morning And he ought to marry her She can help him she added firmly But I shall be forgotten when they _are_ married was the cruel succeeding thought Oh I shall be wholly forgotten And what _what_ shall I do when <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is taken quite from me Where shall I turn _My_ <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I wish I could justly call him mine But I am poverty and incapacity <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> is wealth and power And she is beauty too and love I cannot deny it This is no sordid suit She loves him not with inferior feelings She loves or _will_ love as he must feel proud to be loved Not a valid objection can be made Let them be married then But afterwards I shall be nothing to him As for being his sister and all that stuff I despise it I will either be all or nothing to a man like <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> no feeble shuffling or false cant is endurable Once let that pair be united and I will certainly leave them As for lingering about playing the hypocrite and pretending to calm sentiments of friendship when my soul will be wrung with other feelings I shall not descend to such degradation As little could I fill the place of their mutual friend as that of their deadly foe as little could I stand between them as trample over them <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is a first rate man in my eyes I _have_ loved _do_ love and _must___ love him I would be his wife if I could as I cannot I must go where I shall never see him There is but one alternative to cleave to him as if I were a part of him or to be sundered from him wide as the two poles of a sphere Sunder me then Providence Part us speedily Some such aspirations as these were again working in her mind late in the afternoon when the apparition of one of the personages haunting her thoughts passed the parlour window Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> sauntered slowly by her gait her countenance wearing that mixture of wistfulness and carelessness which when quiescent was the wonted cast of her look and character of her bearing When animated the carelessness quite vanished the wistfulness became blent with a genial gaiety seasoning the laugh the smile the glance with a unique flavour of sentiment so that mirth from her never resembled the crackling of thorns under a pot What do you mean by not coming to see me this afternoon as you promised was her address to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as she entered the room I was not in the humour replied Miss Helstone very truly <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had already fixed on her a penetrating eye No she said I see you are not in the humour for loving me You are in one of your sunless inclement moods when one feels a fellow creature s presence is not welcome to you You have such moods Are you aware of it Do you mean to stay long <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Yes I am come to have my tea and must have it before I go I shall take the liberty then of removing my bonnet without being asked And this she did and then stood on the rug with her hands behind her A pretty expression you have in your countenance she went on still gazing keenly though not inimically rather indeed pityingly at Caroline Wonderfully self supported you look you solitude seeking wounded deer Are you afraid <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> will worry you if she discovers that you are hurt and that you bleed I never do fear <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> But sometimes you dislike her often you avoid her <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> can feel when she is slighted and shunned If you had not walked home in the company you did last night you would have been a different girl to day What time did you reach the rectory By ten Humph You took three quarters of an hour to walk a mile Was it you or <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> who lingered so <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> you talk nonsense _He_ talked nonsense that I doubt not or he looked it which is a thousand times worse I see the reflection of his eyes on your forehead at this moment I feel disposed to call him out if I could only get a trustworthy second I feel desperately irritated I felt so last night and have felt it all day You don t ask me why she proceeded after a pause you little silent over modest thing and you don t deserve that I should pour out my secrets into your lap without an invitation Upon my word I could have found it in my heart to have dogged <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> yesterday evening with dire intent I have pistols and can use them Stuff <PERSON>Shirley Which</PERSON> would you have shot me or <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Neither perhaps Perhaps myself more likely a bat or a tree bough He is a puppy your cousin a quiet serious sensible judicious ambitious puppy I see him standing before me talking his half stern half gentle talk bearing me down as I am very conscious he does with his fixity of purpose etc and then I have no patience with him Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> started off on a rapid walk through the room repeating energetically that she had no patience with men in general and with her tenant in particular You are mistaken urged <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in some anxiety <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is no puppy or male flirt I can vouch for that _You_ vouch for it Do you think I ll take your word on the subject There is no one s testimony I would not credit sooner than yours To advance <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s fortune you would cut off your right hand But not tell lies And if I speak the truth I must assure you that he was just civil to me last night that was all I never asked what he was I can guess I saw him from the window take your hand in his long fingers just as he went out at my gate That is nothing I am not a stranger you know I am an old acquaintance and his cousin I feel indignant and that is the long and short of the matter responded Miss Keeldar All my comfort she added presently is broken up by his man uvres He keeps intruding between you and me Without him we should be good friends but that six feet of puppyhood makes a perpetually recurring eclipse of our friendship Again and again he crosses and obscures the disc I want always to see clear ever and anon he renders me to you a mere bore and nuisance No <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> no He does You did not want my society this afternoon and I feel it hard You are naturally somewhat reserved but I am a social personage who cannot live alone If we were but left unmolested I have that regard for you that I could bear you in my presence for ever and not for the fraction of a second do I ever wish to be rid of you You cannot say as much respecting me <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I can say anything you wish <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I like you You will wish me at <LOCATION>Jericho</LOCATION> to morrow <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> I shall not I am every day growing more accustomed to fonder of you You know I am too English to get up a vehement friendship all at once but you are so much better than common you are so different to every day young ladies I esteem you I value you you are never a burden to me never Do you believe what I say Partly replied Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> smiling rather incredulously but you are a peculiar personage Quiet as you look there is both a force and a depth somewhere within not easily reached or appreciated Then you certainly are not happy And unhappy people are rarely good Is that what you mean Not at all I mean rather that unhappy people are often preoccupied and not in the mood for discoursing with companions of my nature Moreover there is a sort of unhappiness which not only depresses but corrodes and that I fear is your portion Will pity do you any good <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> If it will take some from <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> she offers largely and warrants the article genuine <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I never had a sister you never had a sister but it flashes on me at this moment how sisters feel towards each other affection twined with their life which no shocks of feeling can uproot which little quarrels only trample an instant that it may spring more freshly when the pressure is removed affection that no passion can ultimately outrival with which even love itself cannot do more than compete in force and truth Love hurts us so <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> It is so tormenting so racking and it burns away our strength with its flame In affection is no pain and no fire only sustenance and balm I am supported and soothed when you that is _you only_ are near <PERSON>Shirley Do</PERSON> you believe me now I am always easy of belief when the creed pleases me We really are friends then <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> in spite of the black eclipse We really are returned the other drawing <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> towards her and making her sit down chance what may Come then we will talk of something else than the Troubler But at this moment the rector came in and the something else of which Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was about to talk was not again alluded to till the moment of her departure She then delayed a few minutes in the passage to say <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I wish to tell you that I have a great weight on my mind my conscience is quite uneasy as if I had committed or was going to commit a crime It is not my _private_ conscience you must understand but my landed proprietor and lord of the manor conscience I have got into the clutch of an eagle with iron talons I have fallen under a stern influence which I scarcely approve but cannot resist Something will be done ere long I fear which it by no means pleases me to think of To ease my mind and to prevent harm as far as I can I mean to enter on a series of good works <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t be surprised therefore if you see me all at once turn outrageously charitable I have no idea how to begin but you must give me some advice We will talk more on the subject to morrow and just ask that excellent person Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> to step up to Fieldhead I have some notion of putting myself under her tuition Won t she have a precious pupil Drop a hint to her <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> that though a well meaning I am rather a neglected character and then she will feel less scandalized at my ignorance about clothing societies and such things On the morrow <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> found <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> sitting gravely at her desk with an account book a bundle of banknotes and a well filled purse before her She was looking mighty serious but a little puzzled She said she had been casting an eye over the weekly expenditure in housekeeping at the hall trying to find out where she could retrench that she had also just given audience to <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> the cook and had sent that person away with a notion that her <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s brain was certainly crazed I have lectured her on the duty of being careful said she in a way quite new to her So eloquent was I on the text of economy that I surprised myself for you see it is altogether a fresh idea I never thought much less spoke on the subject till lately But it is all theory for when I came to the practical part I could retrench nothing I had not firmness to take off a single pound of butter or to prosecute to any clear result an inquest into the destiny of either dripping lard bread cold meat or other kitchen perquisite whatever I know we never get up illuminations at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> but I could not ask the meaning of sundry quite unaccountable pounds of candles We do not wash for the parish yet I viewed in silence items of soap and bleaching powder calculated to satisfy the solicitude of the most anxious inquirer after our position in reference to those articles Carnivorous I am not nor is Mrs Pryor nor is <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> herself yet I only hemmed and opened my eyes a little wide when I saw butchers bills whose figures seemed to prove that fact falsehood I mean <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> you may laugh at me but you can t change me I am a poltroon on certain points I feel it There is a base alloy of moral cowardice in my composition I blushed and hung my head before <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> when she ought to have been faltering confessions to me I found it impossible to get up the spirit even to hint much less to prove to her that she was a cheat I have no calm dignity no true courage about me <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> what fit of self injustice is this My uncle who is not given to speak well of women says there are not ten thousand men in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> as genuinely fearless as you I am fearless physically I am never nervous about danger I was not startled from self possession when Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> s great red bull rose with a bellow before my face as I was crossing the cowslip lea alone stooped his begrimed sullen head and made a run at me but I was afraid of seeing <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> brought to shame and confusion of face You have twice ten times my strength of mind on certain subjects <PERSON>Caroline You</PERSON> whom no persuasion can induce to pass a bull however quiet he looks would have firmly shown my housekeeper she had done wrong then you would have gently and wisely admonished her and at last I dare say provided she had seemed penitent you would have very sweetly forgiven her Of this conduct I am incapable However in spite of exaggerated imposition I still find we live within our means I have money in hand and I really must do some good with it The Briarfield poor are badly off they must be helped What ought I to do think you <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> Had I not better distribute the cash at once No indeed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> you will not manage properly I have often noticed that your only notion of charity is to give shillings and half crowns in a careless free handed sort of way which is liable to continual abuse You must have a prime minister or you will get yourself into a series of scrapes You suggested Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> yourself to Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> I will apply And meantime promise to keep quiet and not begin throwing away your money What a great deal you have <PERSON>Shirley You</PERSON> must feel very rich with all that Yes I feel of consequence It is not an immense sum but I feel responsible for its disposal and really this responsibility weighs on my mind more heavily than I could have expected They say that there are some families almost starving to death in Briarfield Some of my own cottagers are in wretched circumstances I must and will help them Some people say we shouldn t give alms to the poor <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> They are great fools for their pains For those who are not hungry it is easy to palaver about the degradation of charity and so on but they forget the brevity of life as well as its bitterness We have none of us long to live Let us help each other through seasons of want and woe as well as we can without heeding in the least the scruples of vain philosophy But you do help others <PERSON>Shirley You</PERSON> give a great deal as it is Not enough I must give more or I tell you my brother s blood will some day be crying to Heaven against me For after all if political incendiaries come here to kindle conflagration in the neighbourhood and my property is attacked I shall defend it like a tigress I know I shall Let me listen to Mercy as long as she is near me Her voice once drowned by the shout of ruffian defiance and I shall be full of impulses to resist and quell If once the poor gather and rise in the form of the mob I shall turn against them as an aristocrat if they bully me I must defy if they attack I must resist and I will You talk like <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I feel like <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> only more fierily Let them meddle with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> or <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s mill or <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s interests and I shall hate them At present I am no patrician nor do I regard the poor around me as plebeians but if once they violently wrong me or mine and then presume to dictate to us I shall quite forget pity for their wretchedness and respect for their poverty in scorn of their ignorance and wrath at their insolence <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> how your eyes flash Because my soul burns Would you any more than me let <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> be borne down by numbers If I had your power to aid <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I would use it as you mean to use it If I could be such a friend to him as you can be I would stand by him as you mean to stand by him till death And now <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> though your eyes don t flash they glow You drop your lids but I saw a kindled spark However it is not yet come to fighting What I want to do is to _prevent_ mischief I cannot forget either day or night that these embittered feelings of the poor against the rich have been generated in suffering they would neither hate nor envy us if they did not deem us so much happier than themselves To allay this suffering and thereby lessen this hate let me out of my abundance give abundantly and that the donation may go farther let it be made wisely To that intent we must introduce some clear calm practical sense into our councils So go and fetch Miss Ainley Without another word <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> put on her bonnet and departed It may perhaps appear strange that neither she nor <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> thought of consulting Mrs Pryor on their scheme but they were wise in abstaining To have consulted her and this they knew by instinct would only have been to involve her in painful embarrassment She was far better informed better read a deeper thinker than Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> but of administrative energy of executive activity she had none She would subscribe her own modest mite to a charitable object willingly secret almsgiving suited her but in public plans on a large scale she could take no part as to originating them that was out of the question This <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> knew and therefore she did not trouble <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> by unavailing conferences which could only remind her of her own deficiencies and do no good It was a bright day for Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> when she was summoned to <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> to deliberate on projects so congenial to her when she was seated with all honour and deference at a table with paper pen ink and what was best of all cash before her and requested to draw up a regular plan for administering relief to the destitute poor of Briarfield She who knew them all had studied their wants had again and again felt in what way they might best be succoured could the means of succour only be found was fully competent to the undertaking and a meek exultation gladdened her kind heart as she felt herself able to answer clearly and promptly the eager questions put by the two young girls as she showed them in her answers how much and what serviceable knowledge she had acquired of the condition of her fellow creatures around her <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> placed at her disposal 300 and at sight of the money Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s eyes filled with joyful tears for she already saw the hungry fed the naked clothed the sick comforted thereby She quickly drew up a simple sensible plan for its expenditure and she assured them brighter times would now come round for she doubted not the lady of <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> s example would be followed by others She should try to get additional subscriptions and to form a fund but first she must consult the clergy Yes on that point she was peremptory Mr Helstone Dr <LOCATION>Boultby Mr Hall</LOCATION> _must_ be consulted for not only must Briarfield be relieved but <PERSON>Whinbury</PERSON> and Nunnely It would she averred be presumption in her to take a single step unauthorized by them The clergy were sacred beings in Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s eyes no matter what might be the insignificance of the individual his station made him holy The very curates who in their trivial arrogance were hardly worthy to tie her patten strings or carry her cotton umbrella or check woollen shawl she in her pure sincere enthusiasm looked upon as sucking saints No matter how clearly their little vices and enormous absurdities were pointed out to her she could not see them she was blind to ecclesiastical defects the white surplice covered a multitude of sins <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> knowing this harmless infatuation on the part of her recently chosen prime minister stipulated expressly that the curates were to have no voice in the disposal of the money that their meddling fingers were not to be inserted into the pie The rectors of course must be paramount and they might be trusted They had some experience some sagacity and Mr Hall at least had sympathy and loving kindness for his fellow men but as for the youth under them they must be set aside kept down and taught that subordination and silence best became their years and capacity It was with some horror Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> heard this language <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> however interposing with a mild word or two in praise of Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> calmed her again <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> was indeed her own favourite She endeavoured to respect <PERSON>Messrs Malone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> but the slices of sponge cake and glasses of cowslip or primrose wine she had at different times administered to <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> when he came to see her in her little cottage were ever offered with sentiments of truly motherly regard The same innocuous collation she had once presented to <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> but that personage evinced such open scorn of the offering she had never ventured to renew it To <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> she always served the treat and was happy to see his approbation of it proved beyond a doubt by the fact of his usually eating two pieces of cake and putting a third in his pocket Indefatigable in her exertions where good was to be done Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> would immediately have set out on a walk of ten miles round to the three rectors in order to show her plan and humbly solicit their approval but Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> interdicted this and proposed as an amendment to collect the clergy in a small select reunion that evening at Fieldhead Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> was to meet them and the plan was to be discussed in full privy council <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> managed to get the senior priesthood together accordingly and before the old maid s arrival she had further talked all the gentlemen into the most charming mood imaginable She herself had taken in hand Dr <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> and Mr Helstone The first was a stubborn old Welshman hot opinionated and obstinate but withal a man who did a great deal of good though not without making some noise about it The latter we know She had rather a friendly feeling for both especially for old <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and it cost her no trouble to be quite delightful to them She took them round the garden she gathered them flowers she was like a kind daughter to them Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> she left to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> or rather it was to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s care Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> consigned himself He generally sought <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in every party where she and he happened to be He was not in general a lady s man though all ladies liked him something of a book worm he was near sighted spectacled now and then abstracted To old ladies he was kind as a son To men of every occupation and grade he was acceptable The truth simplicity frankness of his manners the nobleness of his integrity the reality and elevation of his piety won him friends in every grade His poor clerk and sexton delighted in him the noble patron of his living esteemed him highly It was only with young handsome fashionable and stylish ladies he felt a little shy Being himself a plain man plain in aspect plain in manners plain in speech he seemed to fear their dash elegance and airs But Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> had neither dash nor airs and her native elegance was of a very quiet order quiet as the beauty of a ground loving hedge flower He was a fluent cheerful agreeable talker <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> could talk too in a _t te t te_ She liked <PERSON>Mr Hall</PERSON> to come and take the seat next her in a party and thus secure her from <PERSON>Peter Augustus Malone Joseph Donne</PERSON> or <PERSON>John Sykes</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> never failed to avail himself of this privilege when he possibly could Such preference shown by a single gentleman to a single lady would certainly in ordinary cases have set in motion the tongues of the gossips but <PERSON>Cyril Hall</PERSON> was forty five years old slightly bald and slightly gray and nobody ever said or thought he was likely to be married to Miss <PERSON>Helstone Nor</PERSON> did he think so himself He was wedded already to his books and his parish His kind sister <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> spectacled and learned like himself made him happy in his single state he considered it too late to change Besides he had known <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as a pretty little girl She had sat on his knee many a time he had bought her toys and given her books he felt that her friendship for him was mixed with a sort of filial respect he could not have brought himself to attempt to give another colour to her sentiments and his serene mind could glass a fair image without feeling its depths troubled by the reflection When Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> arrived she was made kindly welcome by every one Mrs Pryor and <PERSON>Margaret Hall</PERSON> made room for her on the sofa between them and when the three were seated they formed a trio which the gay and thoughtless would have scorned indeed as quite worthless and unattractive a middle aged widow and two plain spectacled old maids yet which had its own quiet value as many a suffering and friendless human being knew <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> opened the business and showed the plan I know the hand which drew up that said Mr Hall glancing at Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> and smiling benignantly His approbation was won at once <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> heard and deliberated with bent brow and protruded under lip His consent he considered too weighty to be given in a hurry <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> glanced sharply round with an alert suspicious expression as if he apprehended that female craft was at work and that something in petticoats was somehow trying underhand to acquire too much influence and make itself of too much importance <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> caught and comprehended the expression This scheme is nothing said she carelessly It is only an outline a mere suggestion You gentlemen are requested to draw up rules of your own And she directly fetched her writing case smiling queerly to herself as she bent over the table where it stood She produced a sheet of paper a new pen drew an arm chair to the table and presenting her hand to old <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> begged permission to install him in it For a minute he was a little stiff and stood wrinkling his copper coloured forehead strangely At last he muttered Well you are neither my wife nor my daughter so I ll be led for once but mind I know I _am_ led Your little female man uvres don t blind me Oh said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> dipping the pen in the ink and putting it into his hand you must regard me as Captain <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> to day This is quite a gentleman s affair yours and mine entirely doctor so she had dubbed the rector The ladies there are only to be our aides de camp and at their peril they speak till we have settled the whole business He smiled a little grimly and began to write He soon interrupted himself to ask questions and consult his brethren disdainfully lifting his glance over the curly heads of the two girls and the demure caps of the elder ladies to meet the winking glasses and gray pates of the priests In the discussion which ensued all three gentlemen to their infinite credit showed a thorough acquaintance with the poor of their parishes an even minute knowledge of their separate wants Each rector knew where clothing was needed where food would be most acceptable where money could be bestowed with a probability of it being judiciously laid out Wherever their memories fell short Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> or <LOCATION>Miss Hall</LOCATION> if applied to could help them out but both ladies took care not to speak unless spoken to Neither of them wanted to be foremost but each sincerely desired to be useful and useful the clergy consented to make them with which boon they were content <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> stood behind the rectors leaning over their shoulders now and then to glance at the rules drawn up and the list of cases making out listening to all they said and still at intervals smiling her queer smile a smile not ill natured but significant too significant to be generally thought amiable Men rarely like such of their fellows as read their inward nature too clearly and truly It is good for women especially to be endowed with a soft blindness to have mild dim eyes that never penetrate below the surface of things that take all for what it seems Thousands knowing this keep their eyelids drooped on system but the most downcast glance has its loophole through which it can on occasion take its sentinel survey of life I remember once seeing a pair of blue eyes that were usually thought sleepy secretly on the alert and I knew by their expression an expression which chilled my blood it was in that quarter so wondrously unexpected that for years they had been accustomed to silent soul reading The world called the owner of these blue eyes _bonne petite femme_ she was not an Englishwoman I learned her nature afterwards got it off by heart studied it in its farthest most hidden recesses She was the finest deepest subtlest schemer in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> When all was at length settled to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s mind and the clergy had entered so fully into the spirit of her plans as to head the subscription list with their signatures for 50 each she ordered supper to be served having previously directed <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> to exercise her utmost skill in the preparation of this repast Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> was no _bon vivant_ he was naturally an abstemious man indifferent to luxury but <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> both liked good cookery The _recherch _ supper consequently put them into excellent humour They did justice to it though in a gentlemanly way not in the mode Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> would have done had he been present A glass of fine wine was likewise tasted with discerning though most decorous relish Captain <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was complimented on his taste the compliment charmed him It had been his aim to gratify and satisfy his priestly guests He had succeeded and was radiant with glee CHAPTER XV <PERSON>MR DONNE</PERSON> S EXODUS The next day <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> expressed to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> how delighted she felt that the little party had gone off so well I rather like to entertain a circle of gentlemen said she It is amusing to observe how they enjoy a judiciously concocted repast For ourselves you see these choice wines and these scientific dishes are of no importance to us but gentlemen seem to retain something of the _na vet _ of children about food and one likes to please them that is when they show the becoming decent self government of our admirable rectors I watch <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> sometimes to try and discover how he can be pleased but he has not that child s simplicity about him Did you ever find out his accessible point <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> you have seen more of him than I It is not at any rate that of my uncle and Dr <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> returned <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> smiling She always felt a sort of shy pleasure in following Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s lead respecting the discussion of her cousin s character Left to herself she would never have touched on the subject but when invited the temptation of talking about him of whom she was ever thinking was irresistible But she added I really don t know what it is for I never watched <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> in my life but my scrutiny was presently baffled by finding he was watching me There it is exclaimed <PERSON>Shirley You</PERSON> can t fix your eyes on him but his presently flash on you He is never off his guard He won t give you an advantage Even when he does not look at you his thoughts seem to be busy amongst your own thoughts tracing your words and actions to their source contemplating your motives at his ease Oh I know that sort of character or something in the same style It is one that piques me singularly How does it affect you This question was a specimen of one of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s sharp sudden turns <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> used to be fluttered by them at first but she had now got into the way of parrying these home thrusts like a little Quakeress Pique you In what way does it pique you she said Here he comes suddenly exclaimed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> breaking off starting up and running to the window Here comes a diversion I never told you of a superb conquest I have made lately made at those parties to which I can never persuade you to accompany me and the thing has been done without effort or intention on my part that I aver There is the bell and by all that s delicious there are two of them Do they never hunt then except in couples You may have one <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> and you may take your choice I hope I am generous enough Listen to Tartar The black muzzled tawny dog a glimpse of which was seen in the chapter which first introduced its mistress to the reader here gave tongue in the hall amidst whose hollow space the deep bark resounded formidably A growl more terrible than the bark menacing as muttered thunder succeeded Listen again cried <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> laughing You would think that the prelude to a bloody onslaught They will be frightened They don t know old Tartar as I do They are not aware his uproars are all sound and fury signifying nothing Some bustle was heard Down sir down exclaimed a high toned imperious voice and then came a crack of a cane or whip Immediately there was a yell a scutter a run a positive tumult O <PERSON>Malone Malone</PERSON> Down down down cried the high voice He really is worrying them exclaimed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> They have struck him A blow is what he is not used to and will not take Out she ran A gentleman was fleeing up the oak staircase making for refuge in the gallery or chambers in hot haste another was backing fast to the stairfoot wildly flourishing a knotty stick at the same time reiterating Down down down while the tawny dog bayed bellowed howled at him and a group of servants came bundling from the kitchen The dog made a spring the second gentleman turned tail and rushed after his comrade The first was already safe in a bedroom he held the door against his fellow nothing so merciless as terror But the other fugitive struggled hard the door was about to yield to his strength Gentlemen was uttered in Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s silvery but vibrating tones spare my locks if you please Calm yourselves Come down Look at Tartar he won t harm a cat She was caressing the said Tartar He lay crouched at her feet his fore paws stretched out his tail still in threatening agitation his nostrils snorting his bulldog eyes conscious of a dull fire He was an honest phlegmatic stupid but stubborn canine character He loved his mistress and <PERSON>John the man</PERSON> who fed him but was mostly indifferent to the rest of the world Quiet enough he was unless struck or threatened with a stick and that put a demon into him at once Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> how do you do continued <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> lifting up her mirth lit face to the gallery That is not the way to the oak parlour that is <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> s apartment Request your friend Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> to evacuate I shall have the greatest pleasure in receiving him in a lower room Ha ha cried <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> in hollow laughter quitting the door and leaning over the massive balustrade Really that animal alarmed <PERSON>Donne He</PERSON> is a little timid he proceeded stiffening himself and walking trimly to the stairhead I thought it better to follow in order to reassure him It appears you did Well come down if you please <PERSON>John</PERSON> turning to her manservant go upstairs and liberate Mr Donne Take care Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> the stairs are slippery In truth they were being of polished oak The caution came a little late for <PERSON>Malone He</PERSON> had slipped already in his stately descent and was only saved from falling by a clutch at the banisters which made the whole structure creak again Tartar seemed to think the visitor s descent effected with unwarranted _ clat_ and accordingly he growled once more <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> however was no coward The spring of the dog had taken him by surprise but he passed him now in suppressed fury rather than fear If a look could have strangled Tartar he would have breathed no more Forgetting politeness in his sullen rage <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> pushed into the parlour before Miss Keeldar He glanced at Miss Helstone he could scarcely bring himself to bend to her He glared on both the ladies He looked as if had either of them been his wife he would have made a glorious husband at the moment In each hand he seemed as if he would have liked to clutch one and gripe her to death However <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> took pity She ceased to laugh and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was too true a lady to smile even at any one under mortification Tartar was dismissed <PERSON>Peter Augustus</PERSON> was soothed for <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had looks and tones that might soothe a very bull He had sense to feel that since he could not challenge the owner of the dog he had better be civil And civil he tried to be and his attempts being well received he grew presently _very_ civil and quite himself again He had come indeed for the express purpose of making himself charming and fascinating Rough portents had met him on his first admission to <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> but that passage got over charming and fascinating he resolved to be Like March having come in like a lion he purposed to go out like a lamb For the sake of air as it appeared or perhaps for that of ready exit in case of some new emergency arising he took his seat not on the sofa where Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> offered him enthronization nor yet near the fireside to which <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> by a friendly sign gently invited him but on a chair close to the door Being no longer sullen or furious he grew after his fashion constrained and embarrassed He talked to the ladies by fits and starts choosing for topics whatever was most intensely commonplace He sighed deeply significantly at the close of every sentence he sighed in each pause he sighed ere he opened his mouth At last finding it desirable to add ease to his other charms he drew forth to aid him an ample silk pocket handkerchief This was to be the graceful toy with which his unoccupied hands were to trifle He went to work with a certain energy He folded the red and yellow square cornerwise he whipped it open with a waft again he folded it in narrower compass he made of it a handsome band To what purpose would he proceed to apply the ligature Would he wrap it about his throat his head Should it be a comforter or a turban Neither <PERSON>Peter Augustus</PERSON> had an inventive an original genius He was about to show the ladies graces of action possessing at least the charm of novelty He sat on the chair with his athletic Irish legs crossed and these legs in that attitude he circled with the bandana and bound firmly together It was evident he felt this device to be worth an encore he repeated it more than once The second performance sent <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> to the window to laugh her silent but irrepressible laugh unseen it turned <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s head aside that her long curls might screen the smile mantling on her features Miss Helstone indeed was amused by more than one point in <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> s demeanour She was edified at the complete though abrupt diversion of his homage from herself to the heiress The 5 000 he supposed her likely one day to inherit were not to be weighed in the balance against Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s estate and hall He took no pains to conceal his calculations and tactics He pretended to no gradual change of views he wheeled about at once The pursuit of the lesser fortune was openly relinquished for that of the greater On what grounds he expected to succeed in his chase himself best knew certainly not by skilful management From the length of time that elapsed it appeared that <PERSON>John</PERSON> had some difficulty in persuading Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> to descend At length however that gentleman appeared nor as he presented himself at the oak parlour door did he seem in the slightest degree ashamed or confused not a whit <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> indeed was of that coldly phlegmatic immovably complacent densely self satisfied nature which is insensible to shame He had never blushed in his life no humiliation could abash him his nerves were not capable of sensation enough to stir his life and make colour mount to his cheek he had no fire in his blood and no modesty in his soul he was a frontless arrogant decorous slip of the commonplace conceited inane insipid and this gentleman had a notion of wooing Miss Keeldar He knew no more however how to set about the business than if he had been an image carved in wood He had no idea of a taste to be pleased a heart to be reached in courtship His notion was when he should have formally visited her a few times to write a letter proposing marriage Then he calculated she would accept him for love of his office then they would be married then he should be master of <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> and he should live very comfortably have servants at his command eat and drink of the best and be a great man You would not have suspected his intentions when he addressed his intended bride in an impertinent injured tone A very dangerous dog that Miss Keeldar I wonder you should keep such an animal Do you Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> Perhaps you will wonder more when I tell you I am very fond of him I should say you are not serious in the assertion Can t fancy a lady fond of that brute tis so ugly a mere carter s dog Pray hang him Hang what I am fond of And purchase in his stead some sweetly pooty pug or poodle something appropriate to the fair sex Ladies generally like lap dogs Perhaps I am an exception Oh you can t be you know All ladies are alike in those matters That is universally allowed Tartar frightened you terribly Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> I hope you won t take any harm That I shall no doubt He gave me a turn I shall not soon forget When I _sor_ him such was Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> s pronunciation about to spring I thought I should have fainted Perhaps you did faint in the bedroom you were a long time there No I bore up that I might hold the door fast I was determined not to let any one enter I thought I would keep a barrier between me and the enemy But what if your friend Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> had been worried <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> must take care of himself Your man persuaded me to come out at last by saying the dog was chained up in his kennel If I had not been assured of this I would have remained all day in the chamber But what is that I declare the man has told a falsehood The dog is there And indeed Tartar walked past the glass door opening to the garden stiff tawny and black muzzled as ever He still seemed in bad humour He was growling again and whistling a half strangled whistle being an inheritance from the bulldog side of his ancestry There are other visitors coming observed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> with that provoking coolness which the owners of formidable looking dogs are apt to show while their animals are all bristle and bay Tartar sprang down the pavement towards the gate bellowing _avec explosion_ His mistress quietly opened the glass door and stepped out chirruping to him His bellow was already silenced and he was lifting up his huge blunt stupid head to the new callers to be patted What <ORGANIZATION>Tartar Tartar</ORGANIZATION> said a cheery rather boyish voice don t you know us Good morning old boy And little Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> whose conscious good nature made him comparatively fearless of man woman child or brute came through the gate caressing the guardian His vicar <PERSON>Mr Hall</PERSON> followed He had no fear of Tartar either and Tartar had no ill will to him He snuffed both the gentlemen round and then as if concluding that they were harmless and might be allowed to pass he withdrew to the sunny front of the hall leaving the archway free Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> followed and would have played with him but <PERSON>Tartar</PERSON> took no notice of his caresses It was only his mistress s hand whose touch gave him pleasure to all others he showed himself obstinately insensible <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> advanced to meet <PERSON>Messrs Hall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> shaking hands with them cordially They were come to tell her of certain successes they had achieved that morning in applications for subscriptions to the fund Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> s eyes beamed benignantly through his spectacles his plain face looked positively handsome with goodness and when <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> seeing who was come ran out to meet him and put both her hands into his he gazed down on her with a gentle serene affectionate expression that gave him the aspect of a smiling Melanchthon Instead of re entering the house they strayed through the garden the ladies walking one on each side of Mr Hall It was a breezy sunny day the air freshened the girls cheeks and gracefully dishevelled their ringlets Both of them looked pretty one gay Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> spoke oftenest to his brilliant companion looked most frequently at the quiet one Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> gathered handfuls of the profusely blooming flowers whose perfume filled the enclosure She gave some to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> telling her to choose a nosegay for Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and with her lap filled with delicate and splendid blossoms <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sat down on the steps of a summer house The vicar stood near her leaning on his cane <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> who could not be inhospitable now called out the neglected pair in the oak parlour She convoyed <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> past his dread enemy Tartar who with his nose on his fore paws lay snoring under the meridian sun <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> was not grateful he never _was_ grateful for kindness and attention but he was glad of the safeguard Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> desirous of being impartial offered the curates flowers They accepted them with native awkwardness <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> seemed specially at a loss when a bouquet filled one hand while his shillelah occupied the other <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> s Thank you was rich to hear It was the most fatuous and arrogant of sounds implying that he considered this offering a homage to his merits and an attempt on the part of the heiress to ingratiate herself into his priceless affections <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> alone received the posy like a smart sensible little man as he was putting it gallantly and nattily into his buttonhole As a reward for his good manners Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> beckoning him apart gave him some commission which made his eyes sparkle with glee Away he flew round by the courtyard to the kitchen No need to give him directions he was always at home everywhere Ere long he reappeared carrying a round table which he placed under the cedar then he collected six garden chairs from various nooks and bowers in the grounds and placed them in a circle The parlour maid Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> kept no footman came out bearing a napkin covered tray <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> s nimble fingers aided in disposing glasses plates knives and forks he assisted her too in setting forth a neat luncheon consisting of cold chicken ham and tarts This sort of impromptu regale it was <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s delight to offer any chance guests and nothing pleased her better than to have an alert obliging little friend like <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> to run about her hand cheerily receive and briskly execute her hospitable hints <PERSON>David</PERSON> and she were on the best terms in the world and his devotion to the heiress was quite disinterested since it prejudiced in nothing his faithful allegiance to the magnificent <PERSON>Dora Sykes</PERSON> The repast turned out a very merry one <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> indeed contributed but little to its vivacity the chief part they played in it being what concerned the knife fork and wine glass but where four such natures as Mr Hall <PERSON>David Sweeting Shirley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> were assembled in health and amity on a green lawn under a sunny sky amidst a wilderness of flowers there could not be ungenial dullness In the course of conversation Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> reminded the ladies that <PERSON>Whitsuntide</PERSON> was approaching when the grand united Sunday school tea drinking and procession of the three parishes of <LOCATION>Briarfield Whinbury</LOCATION> and Nunnely were to take place <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> he knew would be at her post as teacher he said and he hoped Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> would not be wanting He hoped she would make her first public appearance amongst them at that time <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was not the person to miss an occasion of this sort She liked festive excitement a gathering of happiness a concentration and combination of pleasant details a throng of glad faces a muster of elated hearts She told Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> they might count on her with security She did not know what she would have to do but they might dispose of her as they pleased And said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> you will promise to come to my table and to sit near me Mr Hall I shall not fail _Deo volente_ said he I have occupied the place on her right hand at these monster tea drinkings for the last six years he proceeded turning to Miss Keeldar They made her a Sunday school teacher when she was a little girl of twelve She is not particularly self confident by nature as you may have observed and the first time she had to take a tray as the phrase is and make tea in public there was some piteous trembling and flushing I observed the speechless panic the cups shaking in the little hand and the overflowing teapot filled too full from the urn I came to her aid took a seat near her managed the urn and the slop basin and in fact made the tea for her like any old woman I was very grateful to you interposed <PERSON>Caroline You</PERSON> were You told me so with an earnest sincerity that repaid me well inasmuch as it was not like the majority of little ladies of twelve whom you may help and caress for ever without their evincing any quicker sense of the kindness done and meant than if they were made of wax and wood instead of flesh and nerves She kept close to me Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> the rest of the evening walking with me over the grounds where the children were playing she followed me into the vestry when all were summoned into church she would I believe have mounted with me to the pulpit had I not taken the previous precaution of conducting her to the rectory pew And he has been my friend ever since said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> And always sat at her table near her tray and handed the cups that is the extent of my services The next thing I do for her will be to marry her some day to some curate or mill owner But mind <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I shall inquire about the bridegroom s character and if he is not a gentleman likely to render happy the little girl who walked with me hand in hand over Nunnely Common I will not officiate So take care The caution is useless I am not going to be married I shall live single like your sister <PERSON>Margaret Mr Hall Very</PERSON> well You might do worse <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> is not unhappy She has her books for a pleasure and her brother for a care and is content If ever you want a home if the day should come when <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> rectory is yours no longer come to Nunnely vicarage Should the old maid and bachelor be still living they will make you tenderly welcome There are your flowers Now said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who had kept the nosegay she had selected for him till this moment _you_ don t care for a bouquet but you must give it to <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> only to be sentimental for once keep that little forget me not which is a wild flower I gathered from the grass and to be still more sentimental let me take two or three of the blue blossoms and put them in my souvenir And she took out a small book with enamelled cover and silver clasp wherein having opened it she inserted the flowers writing round them in pencil To be kept for the sake of the <ORGANIZATION>Rev Cyril Hall</ORGANIZATION> my friend May 18 The Rev Cyril Hall on his part also placed a sprig in safety between the leaves of a pocket Testament He only wrote on the margin <PERSON>Caroline Now</PERSON> said he smiling I trust we are romantic enough Miss Keeldar he continued the curates by the bye during this conversation were too much occupied with their own jokes to notice what passed at the other end of the table I hope you are laughing at this trait of _exaltation_ in the old gray headed vicar but the fact is I am so used to comply with the requests of this young friend of yours I don t know how to refuse her when she tells me to do anything You would say it is not much in my way to traffic with flowers and forget me nots but you see when requested to be sentimental I am obedient He is naturally rather sentimental remarked <PERSON>Caroline Margaret</PERSON> told me so and I know what pleases him That you should be good and happy Yes that is one of my greatest pleasures May God long preserve to you the blessings of peace and innocence By which phrase I mean _comparative_ innocence for in His sight I am well aware _none_ are pure What to our human perceptions looks spotless as we fancy angels is to Him but frailty needing the blood of His Son to cleanse and the strength of His Spirit to sustain Let us each and all cherish humility I as you my young friends and we may well do it when we look into our own hearts and see there temptations inconsistencies propensities even we blush to recognize And it is not youth nor good looks nor grace nor any gentle outside charm which makes either beauty or goodness in God s eyes Young ladies when your mirror or men s tongues flatter you remember that in the sight of her Maker <PERSON>Mary Ann Ainley</PERSON> a woman whom neither glass nor lips have ever panegyrized is fairer and better than either of you She is indeed he added after a pause she is indeed You young things wrapt up in yourselves and in earthly hopes scarcely live as <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> lived Perhaps you cannot do it yet while existence is so sweet and earth so smiling to you it would be too much to expect She with meek heart and due reverence treads close in her Redeemer s steps Here the harsh voice of <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> broke in on the mild tones of Mr <PERSON>Hall Ahem</PERSON> he began clearing his throat evidently for a speech of some importance ahem Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> your attention an instant if you please Well said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> nonchalantly what is it I listen All of me is ear that is not eye I hope part of you is hand also returned <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> in his vulgarly presumptuous and familiar style and part purse It is to the hand and purse I propose to appeal I came here this morning with a view to beg of you You should have gone to <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> she is my almoner To beg of you a subscription to a school I and Dr <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> intend to erect one in the hamlet of Ecclefigg which is under our vicarage of Whinbury The Baptists have got possession of it They have a chapel there and we want to dispute the ground But I have nothing to do with Ecclefigg I possess no property there What does that signify You re a churchwoman ain t you Admirable creature muttered <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> under her breath Exquisite address Fine style What raptures he excites in me Then aloud I am a churchwoman certainly Then you can t refuse to contribute in this case The population of Ecclefigg are a parcel of brutes we want to civilize them Who is to be the missionary Myself probably You won t fail through lack of sympathy with your flock I hope not I expect success but we must have money There is the paper Pray give a handsome sum When asked for money <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> rarely held back She put down her name for 5 After the 300 she had lately given and the many smaller sums she was giving constantly it was as much as she could at present afford <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> looked at it declared the subscription shabby and clamorously demanded more Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> flushed up with some indignation and more astonishment At present I shall give no more said she Not give more Why I expected you to head the list with a cool hundred With your property you should never put down a signature for less She was silent In the south went on <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> a lady with a thousand a year would be ashamed to give five pounds for a public object <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> so rarely haughty looked so now Her slight frame became nerved her distinguished face quickened with scorn Strange remarks said she most inconsiderate <LOCATION>Reproach</LOCATION> in return for bounty is misplaced Bounty Do you call five pounds bounty I do and bounty which had I not given it to Dr <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> s intended school of the erection of which I approve and in no sort to his curate who seems ill advised in his manner of applying for or rather extorting subscriptions bounty I repeat which but for this consideration I should instantly reclaim <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> was thick skinned He did not feel all or half that the tone air glance of the speaker expressed He knew not on what ground he stood Wretched place this <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> he went on I could never have formed an idea_r_ of the country had I not seen it And the people rich and poor what a set How _corse_ and uncultivated They would be scouted in the south <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> leaned forwards on the table her nostrils dilating a little her taper fingers interlaced and compressing each other hard The rich pursued the infatuated and unconscious <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> are a parcel of misers never living as persons with their incomes ought to live You scarsley you must excuse Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> s pronunciation reader it was very choice he considered it genteel and prided himself on his southern accent northern ears received with singular sensations his utterance of certain words you scarsley ever see a fam ly where a propa carriage or a reg la butla is kep and as to the poor just look at them when they come crowding about the church doors on the occasion of a marriage or a funeral clattering in clogs the men in their shirt sleeves and wool combers aprons the women in mob caps and bed gowns They positively deserve that one should turn a mad cow in amongst them to rout their rabble ranks He he what fun it would be There you have reached the climax said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> quietly You have reached the climax she repeated turning her glowing glance towards him You cannot go beyond it and she added with emphasis you _shall_ not in my house Up she rose nobody could control her now for she was exasperated straight she walked to her garden gates wide she flung them open <PERSON>Walk</PERSON> through she said austerely and pretty quickly and set foot on this pavement no more <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> was astounded He had thought all the time he was showing himself off to high advantage as a lofty souled person of the first ton he imagined he was producing a crushing impression Had he not expressed disdain of everything in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> What more conclusive proof could be given that he was better than anything there And yet here was he about to be turned like a dog out of a <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> garden Where under such circumstances was the concatenation accordingly Rid me of you instantly instantly reiterated <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> as he lingered Madam a clergyman turn out a clergyman Off Were you an archbishop you have proved yourself no gentleman and must go Quick She was quite resolved There was no trifling with her Besides Tartar was again rising he perceived symptoms of a commotion he manifested a disposition to join in There was evidently nothing for it but to go and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> made his exodus the heiress sweeping him a deep curtsy as she closed the gates on him How dare the pompous priest abuse his flock How dare the lisping cockney revile <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> was her sole observation on the circumstance as she returned to the table <PERSON>Ere</PERSON> long the little party broke up Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s ruffled and darkened brow curled lip and incensed eye gave no invitation to further social enjoyment CHAPTER XVI WHITSUNTIDE The fund prospered By dint of Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s example the three rectors vigorous exertions and the efficient though quiet aid of their spinster and spectacled lieutenants <PERSON>Mary Ann Ainley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margaret Hall</PERSON> a handsome sum was raised and this being judiciously managed served for the present greatly to alleviate the distress of the unemployed poor The neighbourhood seemed to grow calmer For a fortnight past no cloth had been destroyed no outrage on mill or mansion had been committed in the three parishes <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was sanguine that the evil she wished to avert was almost escaped that the threatened storm was passing over With the approach of summer she felt certain that trade would improve it always did and then this weary war could not last for ever peace must return one day With peace what an impulse would be given to commerce Such was the usual tenor of her observations to her tenant <PERSON>G rard Moore</PERSON> whenever she met him where they could converse and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> would listen very quietly too quietly to satisfy her She would then by her impatient glance demand something more from him some explanation or at least some additional remark Smiling in his way with that expression which gave a remarkable cast of sweetness to his mouth while his brow remained grave he would answer to the effect that himself too trusted in the finite nature of the war that it was indeed on that ground the anchor of his hopes was fixed thereon his speculations depended For you are aware he would continue that I now work Hollow s Mill entirely on speculation I sell nothing there is no market for my goods I manufacture for a future day I make myself ready to take advantage of the first opening that shall occur Three months ago this was impossible to me I had exhausted both credit and capital You well know who came to my rescue from what hand I received the loan which saved me It is on the strength of that loan I am enabled to continue the bold game which a while since I feared I should never play more Total ruin I know will follow loss and I am aware that gain is doubtful but I am quite cheerful So long as I can be active so long as I can strive so long in short as my hands are not tied it is impossible for me to be depressed One year nay but six months of the reign of the olive and I am safe for as you say peace will give an impulse to commerce In this you are right but as to the restored tranquillity of the neighbourhood as to the permanent good effect of your charitable fund I doubt Eleemosynary relief never yet tranquillized the working classes it never made them grateful it is not in human nature that it should I suppose were all things ordered aright they ought not to be in a position to need that humiliating relief and this they feel We should feel it were we so placed Besides to whom should they be grateful To you to the clergy perhaps but not to us mill owners They hate us worse than ever Then the disaffected here are in correspondence with the disaffected elsewhere <LOCATION>Nottingham</LOCATION> is one of their headquarters <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION> another <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> a third The subalterns receive orders from their chiefs they are in a good state of discipline no blow is struck without mature deliberation In sultry weather you have seen the sky threaten thunder day by day and yet night after night the clouds have cleared and the sun has set quietly but the danger was not gone it was only delayed The long threatening storm is sure to break at last There is analogy between the moral and physical atmosphere Well Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> so these conferences always ended take care of yourself If you think that I have ever done you any good reward me by promising to take care of yourself I do I will take close and watchful care I wish to live not to die The future opens like Eden before me and still when I look deep into the shades of my paradise I see a vision that I like better than seraph or cherub glide across remote vistas Do you Pray what vision I see The maid came bustling in with the tea things The early part of that May as we have seen was fine the middle was wet but in the last week at change of moon it cleared again A fresh wind swept off the silver white deep piled rain clouds bearing them mass on mass to the eastern horizon on whose verge they dwindled and behind whose rim they disappeared leaving the vault behind all pure blue space ready for the reign of the summer sun That sun rose broad on Whitsuntide The gathering of the schools was signalized by splendid weather Whit Tuesday was the great day in preparation for which the two large schoolrooms of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> built by the present rector chiefly at his own expense were cleaned out whitewashed repainted and decorated with flowers and evergreens some from the rectory garden two cartloads from <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> and a wheel barrowful from the more stingy domain of <PERSON>De Walden</PERSON> the residence of Mr Wynne In these schoolrooms twenty tables each calculated to accommodate twenty guests were laid out surrounded with benches and covered with white cloths Above them were suspended at least some twenty cages containing as many canaries according to a fancy of the district specially cherished by Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s clerk who delighted in the piercing song of these birds and knew that amidst confusion of tongues they always carolled loudest These tables be it understood were not spread for the twelve hundred scholars to be assembled from the three parishes but only for the patrons and teachers of the schools The children s feast was to be spread in the open air At one o clock the troops were to come in at two they were to be marshalled till four they were to parade the parish then came the feast and afterwards the meeting with music and speechifying in the church Why <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> was chosen for the point of rendezvous the scene of the _f te_ should be explained It was not because it was the largest or most populous parish Whinbury far outdid it in that respect nor because it was the oldest antique as were the hoary church and rectory Nunnely s low roofed temple and mossy parsonage buried both in coeval oaks outstanding sentinels of <LOCATION>Nunnwood</LOCATION> were older still It was simply because Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> willed it so and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s will was stronger than that of <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> or Hall the former _could_ not the latter _would_ not dispute a point of precedence with their resolute and imperious brother They let him lead and rule This notable anniversary had always hitherto been a trying day to <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> because it dragged her perforce into public compelling her to face all that was wealthy respectable influential in the neighbourhood in whose presence but for the kind countenance of Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> she would have appeared unsupported Obliged to be conspicuous obliged to walk at the head of her regiment as the rector s niece and first teacher of the first class obliged to make tea at the first table for a mixed multitude of ladies and gentlemen and to do all this without the countenance of mother aunt or other chaperon she meantime being a nervous person who mortally feared publicity it will be comprehended that under these circumstances she trembled at the approach of Whitsuntide But this year <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was to be with her and that changed the aspect of the trial singularly it changed it utterly It was a trial no longer it was almost an enjoyment Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was better in her single self than a host of ordinary friends Quite self possessed and always spirited and easy conscious of her social importance yet never presuming upon it it would be enough to give one courage only to look at her The only fear was lest the heiress should not be punctual to tryst She often had a careless way of lingering behind time and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knew her uncle would not wait a second for any one At the moment of the church clock tolling two the bells would clash out and the march begin She must look after <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> then in this matter or her expected companion would fail her Whit Tuesday saw her rise almost with the sun She Fanny and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> were busy the whole morning arranging the rectory parlours in first rate company order and setting out a collation of cooling refreshments wine fruit cakes on the dining room sideboard Then she had to dress in her freshest and fairest attire of white muslin the perfect fineness of the day and the solemnity of the occasion warranted and even exacted such costume Her new sash a birthday present from <LOCATION>Margaret Hall</LOCATION> which she had reason to believe <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> himself had bought and in return for which she had indeed given him a set of cambric bands in a handsome case was tied by the dexterous fingers of Fanny who took no little pleasure in arraying her fair young mistress for the occasion Her simple bonnet had been trimmed to correspond with her sash her pretty but inexpensive scarf of white crape suited her dress When ready she formed a picture not bright enough to dazzle but fair enough to interest not brilliantly striking but very delicately pleasing a picture in which sweetness of tint purity of air and grace of mien atoned for the absence of rich colouring and magnificent contour What her brown eye and clear forehead showed of her mind was in keeping with her dress and face modest gentle and though pensive harmonious It appeared that neither lamb nor dove need fear her but would welcome rather in her look of simplicity and softness a sympathy with their own natures or with the natures we ascribe to them After all she was an imperfect faulty human being fair enough of form hue and array but as <PERSON>Cyril Hall</PERSON> said neither so good nor so great as the withered Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> now putting on her best black gown and <ORGANIZATION>Quaker</ORGANIZATION> drab shawl and bonnet in her own narrow cottage chamber Away <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> went across some very sequestered fields and through some quite hidden lanes to Fieldhead She glided quickly under the green hedges and across the greener leas There was no dust no moisture to soil the hem of her stainless garment or to damp her slender sandal After the late rains all was clean and under the present glowing sun all was dry She walked fearlessly then on daisy and turf and through thick plantations she reached <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> and penetrated to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s dressing room It was well she had come or <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> would have been too late Instead of making ready with all speed she lay stretched on a couch absorbed in reading Mrs Pryor stood near vainly urging her to rise and dress <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> wasted no words She immediately took the book from her and with her own hands commenced the business of disrobing and rerobing her <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> indolent with the heat and gay with her youth and pleasurable nature wanted to talk laugh and linger but <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> intent on being in time persevered in dressing her as fast as fingers could fasten strings or insert pins At length as she united a final row of hooks and eyes she found leisure to chide her saying she was very naughty to be so unpunctual that she looked even now the picture of incorrigible carelessness and so <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> did but a very lovely picture of that tiresome quality She presented quite a contrast to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> There was style in every fold of her dress and every line of her figure The rich silk suited her better than a simpler costume the deep embroidered scarf became her She wore it negligently but gracefully The wreath on her bonnet crowned her well The attention to fashion the tasteful appliance of ornament in each portion of her dress were quite in place with her All this suited her like the frank light in her eyes the rallying smile about her lips like her shaft straight carriage and lightsome step <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> took her hand when she was dressed hurried her downstairs out of doors and thus they sped through the fields laughing as they went and looking very much like a snow white dove and gem tinted bird of paradise joined in social flight Thanks to Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s promptitude they arrived in good time While yet trees hid the church they heard the bell tolling a measured but urgent summons for all to assemble The trooping in of numbers the trampling of many steps and murmuring of many voices were likewise audible From a rising ground they presently saw on the <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> road the Whinbury school approaching It numbered five hundred souls The rector and curate <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> headed it the former looming large in full canonicals walking as became a beneficed priest under the canopy of a shovel hat with the dignity of an ample corporation the embellishment of the squarest and vastest of black coats and the support of the stoutest of gold headed canes As the doctor walked he now and then slightly flourished his cane and inclined his shovel hat with a dogmatical wag towards his aide de camp That aide de camp <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> to wit narrow as the line of his shape was compared to the broad bulk of his principal contrived notwithstanding to look every inch a curate All about him was pragmatical and self complacent from his turned up nose and elevated chin to his clerical black gaiters his somewhat short strapless trousers and his square toed shoes Walk on Mr Donne You have undergone scrutiny You think you look well Whether the white and purple figures watching you from yonder hill think so is another question These figures come running down when the regiment has marched by The churchyard is full of children and teachers all in their very best holiday attire and distressed as is the district bad as are the times it is wonderful to see how respectably how handsomely even they have contrived to clothe themselves That British love of decency will work miracles The poverty which reduces an Irish girl to rags is impotent to rob the English girl of the neat wardrobe she knows necessary to her self respect Besides the lady of the manor that <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> now gazing with pleasure on this well dressed and happy looking crowd has really done them good Her seasonable bounty consoled many a poor family against the coming holiday and supplied many a child with a new frock or bonnet for the occasion She knows it and is elate with the consciousness glad that her money example and influence have really substantially benefited those around her She cannot be charitable like Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> it is not in her nature It relieves her to feel that there is another way of being charitable practicable for other characters and under other circumstances <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> too is pleased for she also has done good in her small way robbed herself of more than one dress ribbon or collar she could ill spare to aid in fitting out the scholars of her class and as she could not give money she has followed Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s example in giving her time and her industry to sew for the children Not only is the churchyard full but the rectory garden is also thronged Pairs and parties of ladies and gentlemen are seen walking amongst the waving lilacs and laburnums The house also is occupied at the wide open parlour windows gay groups are standing These are the patrons and teachers who are to swell the procession In the parson s croft behind the rectory are the musicians of the three parish bands with their instruments Fanny and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> in the smartest of caps and gowns and the whitest of aprons move amongst them serving out quarts of ale whereof a stock was brewed very sound and strong some weeks since by the rector s orders and under his special superintendence Whatever he had a hand in must be managed handsomely Shabby doings of any description were not endured under his sanction From the erection of a public building a church school or court house to the cooking of a dinner he still advocated the lordly liberal and effective Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was like him in this respect and they mutually approved each other s arrangements <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> were soon in the midst of the company The former met them very easily for her Instead of sitting down in a retired corner or stealing away to her own room till the procession should be marshalled according to her wont she moved through the three parlours conversed and smiled absolutely spoke once or twice ere she was spoken to and in short seemed a new creature It was <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s presence which thus transformed her the view of Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s air and manner did her a world of good <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had no fear of her kind no tendency to shrink from to avoid it All human beings men women or children whom low breeding or coarse presumption did not render positively offensive were welcome enough to her some much more so than others of course but generally speaking till a man had indisputably proved himself bad and a nuisance <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was willing to think him good and an acquisition and to treat him accordingly This disposition made her a general favourite for it robbed her very raillery of its sting and gave her serious or smiling conversation a happy charm nor did it diminish the value of her intimate friendship which was a distinct thing from this social benevolence depending indeed on quite a different part of her character Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was the choice of her affection and intellect the Misses <PERSON>Pearson Sykes Wynne</PERSON> etc etc only the profiteers by her good nature and vivacity <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> happened to come into the drawing room while <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> sitting on the sofa formed the centre of a tolerably wide circle She had already forgotten her exasperation against him and she bowed and smiled good humouredly The disposition of the man was then seen He knew neither how to decline the advance with dignity as one whose just pride has been wounded nor how to meet it with frankness as one who is glad to forget and forgive His punishment had impressed him with no sense of shame and he did not experience that feeling on encountering his chastiser He was not vigorous enough in evil to be actively malignant he merely passed by sheepishly with a rated scowling look Nothing could ever again reconcile him to his enemy while no passion of resentment for even sharper and more ignominious inflictions could his lymphatic nature know He was not worth a scene said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> What a fool I was To revenge on poor <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> his silly spite at <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> is something like crushing a gnat for attacking the hide of a rhinoceros Had I been a gentleman I believe I should have helped him off the premises by dint of physical force I am glad now I only employed the moral weapon But he must come near me no more I don t like him He irritates me There is not even amusement to be had out of him <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> is better sport It seemed as if <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> wished to justify the preference for the words were scarcely out of the speaker s mouth when <PERSON>Peter Augustus</PERSON> came up all in _grande tenue_ gloved and scented with his hair oiled and brushed to perfection and bearing in one hand a huge bunch of cabbage roses five or six in full blow These he presented to the heiress with a grace to which the most cunning pencil could do but defective justice And who after this could dare to say that <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was not a lady s man He had gathered and he had given flowers he had offered a sentimental a poetic tribute at the shrine of Love or Mammon Hercules holding the distaff was but a faint type of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> bearing the roses He must have thought this himself for he seemed amazed at what he had done He backed without a word he was going away with a husky chuckle of self satisfaction then he bethought himself to stop and turn to ascertain by ocular testimony that he really had presented a bouquet Yes there were the six red cabbages on the purple satin lap a very white hand with some gold rings on the fingers slightly holding them together and streaming ringlets half hiding a laughing face drooped over them Only _half_ hiding <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> saw the laugh it was unmistakable He was made a joke of his gallantry his chivalry were the subject of a jest for a petticoat for two petticoats Miss Helstone too was smiling Moreover he felt he was seen through and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> grew black as a thunder cloud When <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> looked up a fell eye was fastened on her <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> at least had energy enough in hate She saw it in his glance <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> _is_ worth a scene and shall have it if he likes one day she whispered to her friend And now solemn and sombre as to their colour though bland enough as to their faces appeared at the dining room door the three rectors They had hitherto been busy in the church and were now coming to take some little refreshment for the body ere the march commenced The large morocco covered easy chair had been left vacant for Dr Boultby He was put into it and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> obeying the instigations of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> who told her now was the time to play the hostess hastened to hand to her uncle s vast revered and on the whole worthy friend a glass of wine and a plate of macaroons <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> s churchwardens patrons of the Sunday school both as he insisted on their being were already beside him <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> and the other ladies of his congregation were on his right hand and on his left expressing their hopes that he was not fatigued their fears that the day would be too warm for him <PERSON>Mrs Boultby</PERSON> who held an opinion that when her lord dropped asleep after a good dinner his face became as the face of an angel was bending over him tenderly wiping some perspiration real or imaginary from his brow <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> in short was in his glory and in a round sound _voix de poitrine_ he rumbled out thanks for attentions and assurances of his tolerable health Of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> he took no manner of notice as she came near save to accept what she offered He did not see her he never did see her he hardly knew that such a person existed He saw the macaroons however and being fond of sweets possessed himself of a small handful thereof The wine Mrs Boultby insisted on mingling with hot water and qualifying with sugar and nutmeg Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> stood near an open window breathing the fresh air and scent of flowers and talking like a brother to Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> To him <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> turned her attention with pleasure What should she bring him He must not help himself he must be served by her And she provided herself with a little salver that she might offer him variety <PERSON>Margaret Hall</PERSON> joined them so did Miss Keeldar The four ladies stood round their favourite pastor They also had an idea that they looked on the face of an earthly angel <PERSON>Cyril Hall</PERSON> was their pope infallible to them as Dr <PERSON>Thomas Boultby</PERSON> to his admirers A throng too enclosed the rector of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> twenty or more pressed round him and no parson was ever more potent in a circle than old Helstone The curates herding together after their manner made a constellation of three lesser planets Divers young ladies watched them afar off but ventured not nigh Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> produced his watch Ten minutes to two he announced aloud Time for all to fall into line Come He seized his shovel hat and marched away All rose and followed _en masse_ The twelve hundred children were drawn up in three bodies of four hundred souls each in the rear of each regiment was stationed a band between every twenty there was an interval wherein <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> posted the teachers in pairs To the van of the armies he summoned <PERSON>Grace Boultby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Sykes</PERSON> lead out <PERSON>Whinbury Margaret Hall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Ann Ainley</PERSON> conduct Nunnely <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> head <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> Then again he gave command Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> to Whinbury Mr <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> to Nunnely Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> And these gentlemen stepped up before the lady generals The rectors passed to the full front the parish clerks fell to the extreme rear <ORGANIZATION>Helstone</ORGANIZATION> lifted his shovel hat In an instant out clashed the eight bells in the tower loud swelled the sounding bands flute spoke and clarion answered deep rolled the drums and away they marched The broad white road unrolled before the long procession the sun and sky surveyed it cloudless the wind tossed the tree boughs above it and the twelve hundred children and one hundred and forty adults of which it was composed trod on in time and tune with gay faces and glad hearts It was a joyous scene and a scene to do good It was a day of happiness for rich and poor the work first of God and then of the clergy Let <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> s priests have their due They are a faulty set in some respects being only of common flesh and blood like us all but the land would be badly off without them <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would miss her church if that church fell <PERSON>God</PERSON> save it God also reform it CHAPTER XVII THE SCHOOL FEAST Not on combat bent nor of foemen in search was this priest led and woman officered company yet their music played martial tunes and to judge by the eyes and carriage of some Miss Keeldar for instance these sounds awoke if not a martial yet a longing spirit Old Helstone turning by chance looked into her face and he laughed and she laughed at him There is no battle in prospect he said our country does not want us to fight for it No foe or tyrant is questioning or threatening our liberty There is nothing to be done We are only taking a walk Keep your hand on the reins captain and slack the fire of that spirit It is not wanted the more s the pity Take your own advice doctor was <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s response To <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> she murmured I ll borrow of imagination what reality will not give me We are not soldiers bloodshed is not my desire or if we are we are soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION>Cross Time</ORGANIZATION> has rolled back some hundreds of years and we are bound on a pilgrimage to Palestine But no that is too visionary I need a sterner dream We are Lowlanders of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> following a Covenanting captain up into the hills to hold a meeting out of the reach of persecuting troopers We know that battle may follow prayer and as we believe that in the worst issue of battle heaven must be our reward we are ready and willing to redden the peat moss with our blood That music stirs my soul it wakens all my life it makes my heart beat not with its temperate daily pulse but with a new thrilling vigour I almost long for danger for a faith a land or at least a lover to defend Look <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> interrupted <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> What is that red speck above Stilbro Brow You have keener sight than I Just turn your eagle eye to it Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> looked I see she said then added presently there is a line of red They are soldiers cavalry soldiers she subjoined quickly They ride fast There are six of them They will pass us No they have turned off to the right They saw our procession and avoid it by making a circuit Where are they going Perhaps they are only exercising their horses Perhaps so We see them no more now Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> here spoke We shall pass through <PERSON>Royd Lane</PERSON> to reach Nunnely Common by a short cut said he And into the straits of <PERSON>Royd Lane</PERSON> they accordingly defiled It was very narrow so narrow that only two could walk abreast without falling into the ditch which ran along each side They had gained the middle of it when excitement became obvious in the clerical commanders <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> s spectacles and <ORGANIZATION>Helstone</ORGANIZATION> s Rehoboam were agitated the curates nudged each other Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> turned to the ladies and smiled What is the matter was the demand He pointed with his staff to the end of the lane before them Lo and behold another an opposition procession was there entering headed also by men in black and followed also as they could now hear by music Is it our double asked <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> our manifold wraith Here is a card turned up If you wanted a battle you are likely to get one at least of looks whispered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> laughing They shall not pass us cried the curates unanimously we ll not give way Give way retorted <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> sternly turning round who talks of giving way You boys mind what you are about The ladies I know will be firm I can trust them There is not a churchwoman here but will stand her ground against these folks for the honour of the Establishment What does Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> say She asks what is it The Dissenting and Methodist schools the Baptists Independents and <PERSON>Wesleyans</PERSON> joined in unholy alliance and turning purposely into this lane with the intention of obstructing our march and driving us back Bad manners said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and I hate bad manners Of course they must have a lesson A lesson in politeness suggested Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> who was ever for peace not an example of rudeness Old <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> moved on Quickening his step he marched some yards in advance of his company He had nearly reached the other sable leaders when he who appeared to act as the hostile commander in chief a large greasy man with black hair combed flat on his forehead called a halt The procession paused He drew forth a hymn book gave out a verse set a tune and they all struck up the most dolorous of canticles <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> signed to his bands They clashed out with all the power of brass He desired them to play Rule Britannia and ordered the children to join in vocally which they did with enthusiastic spirit The enemy was sung and stormed down his psalm quelled As far as noise went he was conquered Now follow me exclaimed <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> not at a run but at a firm smart pace Be steady every child and woman of you Keep together Hold on by each other s skirts if necessary And he strode on with such a determined and deliberate gait and was besides so well seconded by his scholars and teachers who did exactly as he told them neither running nor faltering but marching with cool solid impetus the curates too being compelled to do the same as they were between two fires Helstone and Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> both of whom watched any deviation with lynx eyed vigilance and were ready the one with his cane the other with her parasol to rebuke the slightest breach of orders the least independent or irregular demonstration that the body of Dissenters were first amazed then alarmed then borne down and pressed back and at last forced to turn tail and leave the outlet from <LOCATION>Royd Lane</LOCATION> free <LOCATION>Boultby</LOCATION> suffered in the onslaught but <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> between them held him up and brought him through the business whole in limb though sorely tried in wind The fat Dissenter who had given out the hymn was left sitting in the ditch He was a spirit merchant by trade a leader of the Nonconformists and it was said drank more water in that one afternoon than he had swallowed for a twelvemonth before Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> had taken care of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> of him He and Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> made their own quiet comments to each other afterwards on the incident Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> shook hands heartily when they had fairly got the whole party through the lane The curates began to exult but Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> presently put the curb on their innocent spirits He remarked that they never had sense to know what to say and had better hold their tongues and he reminded them that the business was none of their managing About half past three the procession turned back and at four once more regained the starting place Long lines of benches were arranged in the close shorn fields round the school There the children were seated and huge baskets covered up with white cloths and great smoking tin vessels were brought out Ere the distribution of good things commenced a brief grace was pronounced by Mr Hall and sung by the children Their young voices sounded melodious even touching in the open air Large currant buns and hot well sweetened tea were then administered in the proper spirit of liberality No stinting was permitted on this day at least the rule for each child s allowance being that it was to have about twice as much as it could possibly eat thus leaving a reserve to be carried home for such as age sickness or other impediment prevented from coming to the feast Buns and beer circulated meantime amongst the musicians and church singers afterwards the benches were removed and they were left to unbend their spirits in licensed play A bell summoned the teachers patrons and patronesses to the schoolroom Miss Keeldar Miss Helstone and many other ladies were already there glancing over the arrangement of their separate trays and tables Most of the female servants of the neighbourhood together with the clerks the singers and the musicians wives had been pressed into the service of the day as waiters Each vied with the other in smartness and daintiness of dress and many handsome forms were seen amongst the younger ones About half a score were cutting bread and butter another half score supplying hot water brought from the coppers of the rector s kitchen The profusion of flowers and evergreens decorating the white walls the show of silver teapots and bright porcelain on the tables the active figures blithe faces gay dresses flitting about everywhere formed altogether a refreshing and lively spectacle Everybody talked not very loudly but merrily and the canary birds sang shrill in their high hung cages <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as the rector s niece took her place at one of the three first tables Mrs Boultby and <PERSON>Margaret Hall</PERSON> officiated at the others At these tables the _ lite_ of the company were to be entertained strict rules of equality not being more in fashion at <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> than elsewhere Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> removed her bonnet and scarf that she might be less oppressed with the heat Her long curls falling on her neck served almost in place of a veil and for the rest her muslin dress was fashioned modestly as a nun s robe enabling her thus to dispense with the encumbrance of a shawl The room was filling Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> had taken his post beside <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who now as she rearranged the cups and spoons before her whispered to him in a low voice remarks on the events of the day He looked a little grave about what had taken place in <PERSON>Royd Lane</PERSON> and she tried to smile him out of his seriousness Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> sat near for a wonder neither laughing nor talking on the contrary very still and gazing round her vigilantly She seemed afraid lest some intruder should take a seat she apparently wished to reserve next her own Ever and anon she spread her satin dress over an undue portion of the bench or laid her gloves or her embroidered handkerchief upon it <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> noticed this _man ge_ at last and asked her what friend she expected <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> bent towards her almost touched her ear with her rosy lips and whispered with a musical softness that often characterized her tones when what she said tended even remotely to stir some sweet secret source of feeling in her heart I expect Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I saw him last night and I made him promise to come with his sister and to sit at our table He won t fail me I feel certain but I apprehend his coming too late and being separated from us Here is a fresh batch arriving every place will be taken Provoking In fact Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> the magistrate his wife his son and his two daughters now entered in high state They were <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> gentry Of course their place was at the first table and being conducted thither they filled up the whole remaining space For Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s comfort Mr <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> inducted himself into the very vacancy she had kept for <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> planting himself solidly on her gown her gloves and her handkerchief Mr <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> was one of the objects of her aversion and the more so because he showed serious symptoms of an aim at her hand The old gentleman too had publicly declared that the Fieldhead estate and the <LOCATION>De Walden</LOCATION> estate were delightfully _contagious_ a malapropism which rumour had not failed to repeat to <PERSON>Shirley Caroline</PERSON> s ears yet rung with that thrilling whisper I expect Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> her heart yet beat and her cheek yet glowed with it when a note from the organ pealed above the confused hum of the place Dr Boultby Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> rose so did all present and grace was sung to the accompaniment of the music and then tea began She was kept too busy with her office for a while to have leisure for looking round but the last cup being filled she threw a restless glance over the room There were some ladies and several gentlemen standing about yet unaccommodated with seats Amidst a group she recognized her spinster friend Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> whom the fine weather had tempted or some urgent friend had persuaded to leave her drear solitude for one hour of social enjoyment Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> looked tired of standing a lady in a yellow bonnet brought her a chair <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knew well that _chapeau en satin jaune_ she knew the black hair and the kindly though rather opinionated and froward looking face under it she knew that _robe de soie noire_ she knew even that _schall gris de lin_ she knew in short <PERSON>Hortense Moore</PERSON> and she wanted to jump up and run to her and kiss her to give her one embrace for her own sake and two for her brother s She half rose indeed with a smothered exclamation and perhaps for the impulse was very strong she would have run across the room and actually saluted her but a hand replaced her in her seat and a voice behind her whispered Wait till after tea <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> and then I ll bring her to you And when she _could_ look up she did and there was <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself close behind smiling at her eagerness looking better than she had ever seen him look looking indeed to her partial eyes so very handsome that she dared not trust herself to hazard a second glance for his image struck on her vision with painful brightness and pictured itself on her memory as vividly as if there daguerreotyped by a pencil of keen lightning He moved on and spoke to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar Shirley</PERSON> irritated by some unwelcome attentions from <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> and by the fact of that gentleman being still seated on her gloves and handkerchief and probably also by <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s want of punctuality was by no means in good humour She first shrugged her shoulders at him and then she said a bitter word or two about his insupportable tardiness <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> neither apologized nor retorted He stood near her quietly as if waiting to see whether she would recover her temper which she did in little more than three minutes indicating the change by offering him her hand <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> took it with a smile half corrective half grateful The slightest possible shake of the head delicately marked the former quality it is probable a gentle pressure indicated the latter You may sit where you can now Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> also smiling You see there is not an inch of room for you here but I discern plenty of space at Mrs Boultby s table between Miss <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> and Miss Birtwhistle Go <PERSON>John Sykes</PERSON> will be your _vis vis_ and you will sit with your back towards us <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> however preferred lingering about where he was He now and then took a turn down the long room pausing in his walk to interchange greetings with other gentlemen in his own placeless predicament but still he came back to the magnet <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> bringing with him each time he returned observations it was necessary to whisper in her ear Meantime poor <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> looked far from comfortable His fair neighbour judging from her movements appeared in a mood the most unquiet and unaccommodating She would not sit still two seconds She was hot she fanned herself complained of want of air and space She remarked that in her opinion when people had finished their tea they ought to leave the tables and announced distinctly that she expected to faint if the present state of things continued Mr <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> offered to accompany her into the open air just the way to give her her death of cold she alleged In short his post became untenable and having swallowed his quantum of tea he judged it expedient to evacuate <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> should have been at hand whereas he was quite at the other extremity of the room deep in conference with <PERSON>Christopher Sykes</PERSON> A large corn factor <PERSON>Timothy Ramsden Esq</PERSON> happened to be nearer and feeling himself tired of standing he advanced to fill the vacant seat <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s expedients did not fail her A sweep of her scarf upset her teacup its contents were shared between the bench and her own satin dress Of course it became necessary to call a waiter to remedy the mischief Mr <PERSON>Ramsden</PERSON> a stout puffy gentleman as large in person as he was in property held aloof from the consequent commotion <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> usually almost culpably indifferent to slight accidents affecting dress etc now made a commotion that might have become the most delicate and nervous of her sex Mr <PERSON>Ramsden</PERSON> opened his mouth withdrew slowly and as Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> again intimated her intention to give way and swoon on the spot he turned on his heel and beat a heavy retreat <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> at last returned Calmly surveying the bustle and somewhat quizzically scanning <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s enigmatical looking countenance he remarked that in truth this was the hottest end of the room that he found a climate there calculated to agree with none but cool temperaments like his own and putting the waiters the napkins the satin robe the whole turmoil in short to one side he installed himself where destiny evidently decreed he should sit <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> subsided her features altered their lines the raised knit brow and inexplicable curve of the mouth became straight again wilfulness and roguery gave place to other expressions and all the angular movements with which she had vexed the soul of <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> were conjured to rest as by a charm Still no gracious glance was cast on <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> On the contrary he was accused of giving her a world of trouble and roundly charged with being the cause of depriving her of the esteem of Mr <PERSON>Ramsden</PERSON> and the invaluable friendship of Mr <PERSON>Samuel Wynne</PERSON> Wouldn t have offended either gentleman for the world she averred I have always been accustomed to treat both with the most respectful consideration and there owing to you how they have been used I shall not be happy till I have made it up I never am happy till I am friends with my neighbours So to morrow I must make a pilgrimage to Royd corn mill soothe the miller and praise the grain and next day I must call at <LOCATION>De Walden</LOCATION> where I hate to go and carry in my reticule half an oatcake to give to Mr <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> s favourite pointers You know the surest path to the heart of each swain I doubt not said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> quietly He looked very content to have at last secured his present place but he made no fine speech expressive of gratification and offered no apology for the trouble he had given His phlegm became him wonderfully It made him look handsomer he was so composed it made his vicinage pleasant it was so peace restoring You would not have thought to look at him that he was a poor struggling man seated beside a rich woman the calm of equality stilled his aspect perhaps that calm too reigned in his soul Now and then from the way in which he looked down on Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> as he addressed her you would have fancied his station towered above hers as much as his stature did Almost stern lights sometimes crossed his brow and gleamed in his eyes Their conversation had become animated though it was confined to a low key she was urging him with questions evidently he refused to her curiosity all the gratification it demanded She sought his eye once with hers You read in its soft yet eager expression that it solicited clearer replies <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> smiled pleasantly but his lips continued sealed Then she was piqued and turned away but he recalled her attention in two minutes He seemed making promises which he soothed her into accepting in lieu of information It appeared that the heat of the room did not suit Miss Helstone She grew paler and paler as the process of tea making was protracted The moment thanks were returned she quitted the table and hastened to follow her cousin <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> who with Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> had already sought the open air <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> had risen when she did perhaps he meant to speak to her but there was yet a parting word to exchange with Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and while it was being uttered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had vanished <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> received her former pupil with a demeanour of more dignity than warmth She had been seriously offended by Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s proceedings and had all along considered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to blame in obeying her uncle too literally You are a very great stranger she said austerely as her pupil held and pressed her hand The pupil knew her too well to remonstrate or complain of coldness She let the punctilious whim pass sure that her natural _bont _ I use this French word because it expresses just what I mean neither goodness nor good nature but something between the two would presently get the upper hand It did <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> had no sooner examined her face well and observed the change its somewhat wasted features betrayed than her mien softened Kissing her on both cheeks she asked anxiously after her health <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> answered gaily It would however have been her lot to undergo a long cross examination followed by an endless lecture on this head had not Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> called off the attention of the questioner by requesting to be conducted home The poor invalid was already fatigued Her weariness made her cross too cross almost to speak to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and besides that young person s white dress and lively look were displeasing in the eyes of Miss Mann The everyday garb of brown stuff or gray gingham and the everyday air of melancholy suited the solitary spinster better she would hardly know her young friend to night and quitted her with a cool nod <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> having promised to accompany her home they departed together <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> now looked round for <PERSON>Shirley She</PERSON> saw the rainbow scarf and purple dress in the centre of a throng of ladies all well known to herself but all of the order whom she systematically avoided whenever avoidance was possible <PERSON>Shyer</PERSON> at some moments than at others she felt just now no courage at all to join this company She could not however stand alone where all others went in pairs or parties so she approached a group of her own scholars great girls or rather young women who were standing watching some hundreds of the younger children playing at blind man s buff Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> knew these girls liked her yet she was shy even with them out of school They were not more in awe of her than she of them She drew near them now rather to find protection in their company than to patronize them with her presence By some instinct they knew her weakness and with natural politeness they respected it Her knowledge commanded their esteem when she taught them her gentleness attracted their regard and because she was what they considered wise and good when _on_ duty they kindly overlooked her evident timidity when off They did not take advantage of it Peasant girls as they were they had too much of our own English sensibility to be guilty of the coarse error They stood round her still civil friendly receiving her slight smiles and rather hurried efforts to converse with a good feeling and good breeding the last quality being the result of the first which soon set her at her ease Mr <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> coming up with great haste to insist on the elder girls joining in the game as well as the younger ones <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was again left alone She was meditating a quiet retreat to the house when <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> perceiving from afar her isolation hastened to her side Let us go to the top of the fields she said I know you don t like crowds Caroline But it will be depriving you of a pleasure <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> to take you from all these fine people who court your society so assiduously and to whom you can without art or effort make yourself so pleasant Not quite without effort I am already tired of the exertion It is but insipid barren work talking and laughing with the good gentlefolks of Briarfield I have been looking out for your white dress for the last ten minutes I like to watch those I love in a crowd and to compare them with others I have thus compared you You resemble none of the rest <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> There are some prettier faces than yours here You are not a model beauty like <PERSON>Harriet Sykes</PERSON> for instance beside her your person appears almost insignificant but you look agreeable you look reflective you look what I call interesting <PERSON>Hush Shirley</PERSON> you flatter me I don t wonder that your scholars like you Nonsense <PERSON>Shirley Talk</PERSON> of something else We will talk of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> then and we will watch him I see him even now Where And as <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> asked the question she looked not over the fields but into Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s eyes as was her wont whenever <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> mentioned any object she descried afar Her friend had quicker vision than herself and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> seemed to think that the secret of her eagle acuteness might be read in her dark gray irides or rather perhaps she only sought guidance by the direction of those discriminating and brilliant spheres There is <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> pointing right across the wide field where a thousand children were playing and now nearly a thousand adult spectators walking about There can you miss the tall stature and straight port He looks amidst the set that surround him like <PERSON>Eliab</PERSON> amongst humbler shepherds like <PERSON>Saul</PERSON> in a war council and a war council it is if I am not mistaken Why so <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> whose eye had at last caught the object it sought <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is just now speaking to my uncle and they are shaking hands They are then reconciled Reconciled not without good reason depend on it making common cause against some common foe And why think you are <PERSON>Messrs Wynne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramsden</PERSON> gathered in such a close circle round them And why is <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> beckoned to join them Where _he_ is summoned be sure a strong arm is needed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> as she watched grew restless her eyes flashed They won t trust me she said That is always the way when it comes to the point What about Cannot you feel There is some mystery afloat some event is expected some preparation is to be made I am certain I saw it all in Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s manner this evening He was excited yet hard Hard to _you_ <PERSON>Shirley Yes</PERSON> to _me_ He often is hard to me We seldom converse _t te t te_ but I am made to feel that the basis of his character is not of eider down Yet he seemed to talk to you softly Did he not Very gentle tones and quiet manner Yet the man is peremptory and secret his secrecy vexes me Yes <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is secret Which he has scarcely a right to be with me especially as he commenced by giving me his confidence Having done nothing to forfeit that confidence it ought not to be withdrawn but I suppose I am not considered iron souled enough to be trusted in a crisis He fears probably to occasion you uneasiness An unnecessary precaution I am of elastic materials not soon crushed He ought to know that But the man is proud He has his faults say what you will <PERSON>Lina Observe</PERSON> how engaged that group appear They do not know we are watching them If we keep on the alert <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> we shall perhaps find the clue to their secret There will be some unusual movements ere long perhaps to morrow possibly to night But my eyes and ears are wide open Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> you shall be under surveillance Be you vigilant also <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> I will <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is going I saw him turn I believe he noticed us They are shaking hands Shaking hands with emphasis added <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> as if they were ratifying some solemn league and covenant They saw <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> quit the group pass through a gate and disappear And he has not bid us good bye murmured <PERSON>Caroline Scarcely</PERSON> had the words escaped her lips when she tried by a smile to deny the confession of disappointment they seemed to imply An unbidden suffusion for one moment both softened and brightened her eyes Oh that is soon remedied exclaimed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> we ll _make_ him bid us good bye _Make_ him That is not the same thing was the answer It _shall_ be the same thing But he is gone you can t overtake him I know a shorter way than that he has taken We will intercept him But <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I would rather not go <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> said this as Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> seized her arm and hurried her down the fields It was vain to contend Nothing was so wilful as <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> when she took a whim into her head <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> found herself out of sight of the crowd almost before she was aware and ushered into a narrow shady spot embowered above with hawthorns and enamelled under foot with daisies She took no notice of the evening sun chequering the turf nor was she sensible of the pure incense exhaling at this hour from tree and plant she only heard the wicket opening at one end and knew <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was approaching The long sprays of the hawthorns shooting out before them served as a screen They saw him before he observed them At a glance <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> perceived that his social hilarity was gone he had left it behind him in the joy echoing fields round the school What remained now was his dark quiet business countenance As <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had said a certain hardness characterized his air while his eye was excited but austere So much the worse timed was the present freak of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s If he had looked disposed for holiday mirth it would not have mattered much but now I told you not to come said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> somewhat bitterly to her friend She seemed truly perturbed To be intruded on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> thus against her will and his expectation and when he evidently would rather not be delayed keenly annoyed her It did not annoy Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> in the least She stepped forward and faced her tenant barring his way You omitted to bid us good bye she said Omitted to bid you good bye Where did you come from Are you fairies I left two like you one in purple and one in white standing at the top of a bank four fields off but a minute ago You left us there and find us here We have been watching you and shall watch you still You must be questioned one day but not now At present all you have to do is to say good night and then pass <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> glanced from one to the other without unbending his aspect Days of f te have their privileges and so have days of hazard observed he gravely Come don t moralize Say good night and pass urged <PERSON>Shirley Must</PERSON> I say good night to you Miss Keeldar Yes and to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> likewise It is nothing new I hope You have bid us both good night before He took her hand held it in one of his and covered it with the other He looked down at her gravely kindly yet commandingly The heiress could not make this man her subject In his gaze on her bright face there was no servility hardly homage but there were interest and affection heightened by another feeling Something in his tone when he spoke as well as in his words marked that last sentiment to be gratitude Your debtor bids you good night May you rest safely and serenely till morning And you Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> what are you going to do What have you been saying to Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> with whom I saw you shake hands Why did all those gentlemen gather round you Put away reserve for once Be frank with me Who can resist you I will be frank To morrow if there is anything to relate you shall hear it Just now pleaded <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> don t procrastinate But I could only tell half a tale And my time is limited I have not a moment to spare Hereafter I will make amends for delay by candour But are you going home Yes Not to leave it any more to night Certainly not At present farewell to both of you He would have taken <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s hand and joined it in the same clasp in which he held <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s but somehow it was not ready for him She had withdrawn a few steps apart Her answer to <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s adieu was only a slight bend of the head and a gentle serious smile He sought no more cordial token Again he said Farewell and quitted them both There it is over said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> when he was gone We have made him bid us good night and yet not lost ground in his esteem I think <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> I hope not was the brief reply I consider you very timid and undemonstrative remarked Miss Keeldar Why did you not give <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> your hand when he offered you his He is your cousin you like him Are you ashamed to let him perceive your affection He perceives all of it that interests him No need to make a display of feeling You are laconic you would be stoical if you could Is love in your eyes a crime Caroline Love a crime No <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> love is a divine virtue But why drag that word into the conversation It is singularly irrelevant Good pronounced <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> The two girls paced the green lane in silence <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> first resumed Obtrusiveness is a crime forwardness is a crime and both disgust but love no purest angel need blush to love And when I see or hear either man or woman couple shame with love I know their minds are coarse their associations debased Many who think themselves refined ladies and gentlemen and on whose lips the word vulgarity is for ever hovering cannot mention love without betraying their own innate and imbecile degradation It is a low feeling in their estimation connected only with low ideas for them You describe three fourths of the world Caroline They are cold they are cowardly they are stupid on the subject Shirley They never loved they never were loved Thou art right <PERSON>Lina And</PERSON> in their dense ignorance they blaspheme living fire seraph brought from a divine altar They confound it with sparks mounting from Tophet The sudden and joyous clash of bells here stopped the dialogue by summoning all to the church CHAPTER XVIII WHICH THE GENTEEL READER IS RECOMMENDED TO SKIP LOW PERSONS BEING HERE INTRODUCED The evening was still and warm close and sultry it even promised to become Round the descending sun the clouds glowed purple summer tints rather Indian than English suffused the horizon and cast rosy reflections on hillside house front tree bole on winding road and undulating pasture ground The two girls came down from the fields slowly By the time they reached the churchyard the bells were hushed the multitudes were gathered into the church The whole scene was solitary How pleasant and calm it is said <PERSON>Caroline And</PERSON> how hot it will be in the church responded <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> And what a dreary long speech Dr <PERSON>Boultby</PERSON> will make And how the curates will hammer over their prepared orations For my part I would rather not enter But my uncle will be angry if he observes our absence I will bear the brunt of his wrath he will not devour me I shall be sorry to miss his pungent speech I know it will be all sense for the church and all causticity for schism He ll not forget the battle of <PERSON>Royd Lane</PERSON> I shall be sorry also to deprive you of Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> s sincere friendly homily with all its racy Yorkshireisms but here I must stay The gray church and grayer tombs look divine with this crimson gleam on them Nature is now at her evening prayers she is kneeling before those red hills I see her prostrate on the great steps of her altar praying for a fair night for mariners at sea for travellers in deserts for lambs on moors and unfledged birds in woods <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I see her and I will tell you what she is like She is like what <PERSON>Eve</PERSON> was when she and <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> stood alone on earth And that is not <PERSON>Milton</PERSON> s Eve <PERSON>Shirley Milton</PERSON> s <PERSON>Eve Milton</PERSON> s Eve I repeat No by the pure <PERSON>Mother of God</PERSON> she is not <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> we are alone we may speak what we think <PERSON>Milton</PERSON> was great but was he good His brain was right how was his heart He saw heaven he looked down on hell He saw Satan and Sin his daughter and Death their horrible offspring Angels serried before him their battalions the long lines of adamantine shields flashed back on his blind eyeballs the unutterable splendour of heaven <PERSON>Devils</PERSON> gathered their legions in his sight their dim discrowned and tarnished armies passed rank and file before him <PERSON>Milton</PERSON> tried to see the first woman but <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> he saw her not You are bold to say so <PERSON>Shirley Not</PERSON> more bold than faithful It was his cook that he saw or it was <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> as I have seen her making custards in the heat of summer in the cool dairy with rose trees and nasturtiums about the latticed window preparing a cold collation for the rectors preserves and dulcet creams puzzled what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not well joined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change All very well too <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I would beg to remind him that the first men of the earth were Titans and that <PERSON>Eve</PERSON> was their mother from her sprang <ORGANIZATION>Saturn Hyperion Oceanus</ORGANIZATION> she bore Prometheus Pagan that you are what does that signify I say there were giants on the earth in those days giants that strove to scale heaven The first woman s breast that heaved with life on this world yielded the daring which could contend with Omnipotence the strength which could bear a thousand years of bondage the vitality which could feed that vulture death through uncounted ages the unexhausted life and uncorrupted excellence sisters to immortality which after millenniums of crimes struggles and woes could conceive and bring forth a Messiah The first woman was heaven born Vast was the heart whence gushed the well spring of the blood of nations and grand the undegenerate head where rested the consort crown of creation She coveted an apple and was cheated by a snake but you have got such a hash of Scripture and mythology into your head that there is no making any sense of you You have not yet told me what you saw kneeling on those hills I saw I now see a woman Titan Her robe of blue air spreads to the outskirts of the heath where yonder flock is grazing a veil white as an avalanche sweeps from her head to her feet and arabesques of lightning flame on its borders Under her breast I see her zone purple like that horizon through its blush shines the star of evening Her steady eyes I cannot picture They are clear they are deep as lakes they are lifted and full of worship they tremble with the softness of love and the lustre of prayer Her forehead has the expanse of a cloud and is paler than the early moon risen long before dark gathers She reclines her bosom on the ridge of <LOCATION>Stilbro Moor</LOCATION> her mighty hands are joined beneath it So kneeling face to face she speaks with God That Eve is <PERSON>Jehovah</PERSON> s daughter as <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> was His son She is very vague and visionary Come <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> we ought to go into church <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I will not I will stay out here with my mother <PERSON>Eve</PERSON> in these days called Nature I love her undying mighty being Heaven may have faded from her brow when she fell in paradise but all that is glorious on earth shines there still She is taking me to her bosom and showing me her heart Hush Caroline You will see her and feel as I do if we are both silent I will humour your whim but you will begin talking again ere ten minutes are over Miss Keeldar on whom the soft excitement of the warm summer evening seemed working with unwonted power leaned against an upright headstone she fixed her eyes on the deep burning west and sank into a pleasurable trance <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> going a little apart paced to and fro beneath the rectory garden wall dreaming too in her way <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had mentioned the word mother That word suggested to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s imagination not the mighty and mystical parent of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s visions but a gentle human form the form she ascribed to her own mother unknown unloved but not unlonged for Oh that the day would come when she would remember her child Oh that I might know her and knowing love her Such was her aspiration The longing of her childhood filled her soul again The desire which many a night had kept her awake in her crib and which fear of its fallacy had of late years almost extinguished relit suddenly and glowed warm in her heart that her mother might come some happy day and send for her to her presence look upon her fondly with loving eyes and say to her tenderly in a sweet voice <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> my child I have a home for you you shall live with me All the love you have needed and not tasted from infancy I have saved for you carefully Come it shall cherish you now A noise on the road roused <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> from her filial hopes and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> from her Titan visions They listened and heard the tramp of horses They looked and saw a glitter through the trees They caught through the foliage glimpses of martial scarlet helm shone plume waved Silent and orderly six soldiers rode softly by The same we saw this afternoon whispered <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> They have been halting somewhere till now They wish to be as little noticed as possible and are seeking their rendezvous at this quiet hour while the people are at church Did I not say we should see unusual things ere long Scarcely were sight and sound of the soldiers lost when another and somewhat different disturbance broke the night hush a child s impatient scream They looked A man issued from the church carrying in his arms an infant a robust ruddy little boy of some two years old roaring with all the power of his lungs He had probably just awaked from a church sleep Two little girls of nine and ten followed The influence of the fresh air and the attraction of some flowers gathered from a grave soon quieted the child The man sat down with him dandling him on his knee as tenderly as any woman the two little girls took their places one on each side Good evening <PERSON>William</PERSON> said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> after due scrutiny of the man He had seen her before and apparently was waiting to be recognized He now took off his hat and grinned a smile of pleasure He was a rough headed hard featured personage not old but very weather beaten His attire was decent and clean that of his children singularly neat It was our old friend <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> The young ladies approached him You are not going into the church he inquired gazing at them complacently yet with a mixture of bashfulness in his look a sentiment not by any means the result of awe of their station but only of appreciation of their elegance and youth Before gentlemen such as <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> or Helstone for instance <PERSON>William</PERSON> was often a little dogged with proud or insolent ladies too he was quite unmanageable sometimes very resentful but he was most sensible of most tractable to good humour and civility His nature a stubborn one was repelled by inflexibility in other natures for which reason he had never been able to like his former master <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and unconscious of that gentleman s good opinion of himself and of the service he had secretly rendered him in recommending him as gardener to Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> and by this means to other families in the neighbourhood he continued to harbour a grudge against his austerity Latterly he had often worked at Fieldhead Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s frank hospitable manners were perfectly charming to him <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> he had known from her childhood unconsciously she was his ideal of a lady Her gentle mien step gestures her grace of person and attire moved some artist fibres about his peasant heart He had a pleasure in looking at her as he had in examining rare flowers or in seeing pleasant landscapes Both the ladies liked <PERSON>William</PERSON> it was their delight to lend him books to give him plants and they preferred his conversation far before that of many coarse hard pretentious people immeasurably higher in station Who was speaking <PERSON>William</PERSON> when you came out asked <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> A gentleman ye set a deal of store on Miss <PERSON>Shirley Mr Donne</PERSON> You look knowing <PERSON>William How</PERSON> did you find out my regard for Mr Donne Ay Miss <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> there s a gleg light i your een sometimes which betrays you You look raight down scornful sometimes when Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> is by Do you like him yourself <PERSON>William Me</PERSON> I m stalled o t curates and so is t wife They ve no manners They talk to poor folk fair as if they thought they were beneath them They re allus magnifying their office It is a pity but their office could magnify them but it does nought o t soart I fair hate pride But you are proud in your own way yourself interposed <PERSON>Caroline You</PERSON> are what you call house proud you like to have everything handsome about you Sometimes you look as if you were almost too proud to take your wages When you were out of work you were too proud to get anything on credit But for your children I believe you would rather have starved than gone to the shops without money and when I wanted to give you something what a difficulty I had in making you take it It is partly true Miss <PERSON>Caroline Ony</PERSON> day I d rather give than take especially from sich as ye Look at t difference between us <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> re a little young slender lass and I m a great strong man I m rather more nor twice your age It is not _my_ part then I think to tak fro _ye_ to be under obligations as they say to _ye_ And that day ye came to our house and called me to t door and offered me five shillings which I doubt ye could ill spare for ye ve no fortin I know that day I war fair a rebel a radical an insurrectionist and _ye_ made me so I thought it shameful that willing and able as I was to work I suld be i such a condition that a young cratur about the age o my own eldest lass suld think it needful to come and offer me her bit o brass I suppose you were angry with me <PERSON>William</PERSON> I almost was in a way But I forgave ye varry soon <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> meant well Ay _I am_ proud and so are _ye_ but your pride and mine is t raight mak what we call i <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> clean pride such as Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> knows nought about Theirs is mucky pride Now I shall teach my lasses to be as proud as Miss <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> there and my lads to be as proud as myseln but I dare ony o em to be like t curates I d lick little <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> if I seed him show any signs o that feeling What is the difference <PERSON>William Ye</PERSON> know t difference weel enow but ye want me to get a gate o talking Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> is almost too proud to do aught for theirseln _we_ are almost too proud to let anybody do aught for us T curates can hardly bide to speak a civil word to them they think beneath them _we_ can hardly bide to tak an uncivil word fro them that thinks themseln aboon us Now <PERSON>William</PERSON> be humble enough to tell me truly how you are getting on in the world Are you well off Miss <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I am varry well off Since I got into t gardening line wi Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s help and since Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> another o t raight sort helped my wife to set up a bit of a shop I ve nought to complain of My family has plenty to eat and plenty to wear My pride makes me find means to have an odd pound now and then against rainy days for I think I d die afore I d come to t parish and me and mine is content But t neighbours is poor yet I see a great deal of distress And consequently there is still discontent I suppose inquired Miss Keeldar _Consequently_ ye say right _consequently_ In course starving folk cannot be satisfied or settled folk The country s not in a safe condition I ll say so mich But what can be done What more can I do for instance Do <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> can do not mich poor young lass <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> ve gi en your brass ye ve done well If ye could transport your tenant Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to Botany Bay ye d happen do better Folks hate him <PERSON>William</PERSON> for shame exclaimed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> warmly If folks _do_ hate him it is to their disgrace not his Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> himself hates nobody He only wants to do his duty and maintain his rights You are wrong to talk so I talk as I think He has a cold unfeeling heart yond Moore But interposed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> supposing <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was driven from the country and his mill razed to the ground would people have more work They d have less I know that and they know that and there is many an honest lad driven desperate by the certainty that whichever way he turns he cannot better himself and there is dishonest men plenty to guide them to the devil scoundrels that reckons to be the people s friends and that knows nought about the people and is as insincere as <PERSON>Lucifer</PERSON> I ve lived aboon forty year in the world and I believe that the people will never have any true friends but theirseln and them two or three good folk i different stations that is friends to all the world Human natur taking it i th lump is nought but selfishness It is but excessive few it is but just an exception here and there now and then sich as ye two young uns and me that being in a different sphere can understand t one t other and be friends wi out slavishness o one hand or pride o t other Them that reckons to be friends to a lower class than their own fro political motives is never to be trusted they always try to make their inferiors tools For my own part I will neither be patronized nor misled for no man s pleasure I ve had overtures made to me lately that I saw were treacherous and I flung em back i the faces o them that offered em You won t tell us what overtures I will not It would do no good It would mak no difference Them they concerned can look after theirseln Ay we se look after werseln said another voice <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> had sauntered forth from the church to get a breath of fresh air and there he stood I ll warrant _ye_ <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> observed <PERSON>William</PERSON> smiling And I ll warrant my maister was the answer Young ladies continued <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> assuming a lordly air ye d better go into th house I wonder what for inquired <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> to whom the overlooker s somewhat pragmatical manners were familiar and who was often at war with him for <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> holding supercilious theories about women in general resented greatly in his secret soul the fact of his master and his master s mill being in a manner under petticoat government and had felt as wormwood and gall certain business visits of the heiress to the Hollow s counting house Because there is nought agate that fits women to be consarned in Indeed There is prayer and preaching agate in that church Are we not concerned in that <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> have been present neither at the prayer nor preaching ma am if I have observed aright What I alluded to was politics <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> here was touching on that subject if I m not mista en Well what then Politics are our habitual study Joe Do you know I see a newspaper every day and two of a Sunday I should think you ll read the marriages probably miss and the murders and the accidents and sich like I read the leading articles <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> and the foreign intelligence and I look over the market prices In short I read just what gentlemen read <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> looked as if he thought this talk was like the chattering of a pie He replied to it by a disdainful silence <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> continued Miss Keeldar I never yet could ascertain properly whether you are a Whig or a Tory Pray which party has the honour of your alliance It is rayther difficult to explain where you are sure not to be understood was <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> s haughty response but as to being a Tory I d as soon be an old woman or a young one which is a more flimsier article still It is the Tories that carries on the war and ruins trade and if I be of any party though political parties is all nonsense I m of that which is most favourable to peace and by consequence to the mercantile interests of this here land So am I <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> replied <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> who had rather a pleasure in teasing the overlooker by persisting in talking on subjects with which he opined she as a woman had no right to meddle partly at least I have rather a leaning to the agricultural interest too as good reason is seeing that I don t desire <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to be under the feet of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and that if a share of my income comes from Hollow s Mill a larger share comes from the landed estate around it It would not do to take any measures injurious to the farmers <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I think The dews at this hour is unwholesome for females observed <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> If you make that remark out of interest in me I have merely to assure you that I am impervious to cold I should not mind taking my turn to watch the mill one of these summer nights armed with your musket <PERSON>Joe Joe Scott</PERSON> s chin was always rather prominent He poked it out at this speech some inches farther than usual But to go back to my sheep she proceeded clothier and mill owner as I am besides farmer I cannot get out of my head a certain idea that we manufacturers and persons of business are sometimes a little a _very little_ selfish and short sighted in our views and rather _too_ regardless of human suffering rather heartless in our pursuit of gain <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t you agree with me <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I cannot argue where I cannot be comprehended was again the answer Man of mystery Your master will argue with me sometimes <PERSON>Joe He</PERSON> is not so stiff as you are Maybe not We ve all our own ways <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> do you seriously think all the wisdom in the world is lodged in male skulls I think that women are a kittle and a froward generation and I ve a great respect for the doctrines delivered in the second chapter of <ORGANIZATION>St Paul</ORGANIZATION> s first Epistle to Timothy What doctrines Joe Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence For <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> was first formed then Eve What has that to do with the business interjected <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> That smacks of rights of primogeniture I ll bring it up to Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> the first time he inveighs against those rights And continued <PERSON>Joe Scott Adam</PERSON> was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression More shame to <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> to sin with his eyes open cried Miss Keeldar To confess the honest truth <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> I never was easy in my mind concerning that chapter It puzzles me It is very plain miss He that runs may read He may read it in his own fashion remarked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> now joining in the dialogue for the first time You allow the right of private judgment I suppose <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> My certy that I do I allow and claim it for every line of the holy Book Women may exercise it as well as men Nay Women is to take their husbands opinion both in politics and religion It s wholesomest for them Oh oh exclaimed both <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline To</PERSON> be sure no doubt on t persisted the stubborn overlooker Consider yourself groaned down and cried shame over for such a stupid observation said Miss Keeldar You might as well say men are to take the opinions of their priests without examination Of what value would a religion so adopted be It would be mere blind besotted superstition And what is _your_ reading Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> o these words o <PERSON>St Paul</PERSON> s Hem I I account for them in this way He wrote that chapter for a particular congregation of Christians under peculiar circumstances and besides I dare say if I could read the original Greek I should find that many of the words have been wrongly translated perhaps misapprehended altogether It would be possible I doubt not with a little ingenuity to give the passage quite a contrary turn to make it say Let the woman speak out whenever she sees fit to make an objection It is permitted to a woman to teach and to exercise authority as much as may be Man meantime cannot do better than hold his peace and so on That willn t wash miss I dare say it will My notions are dyed in faster colours than yours Joe Mr <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> you are a thoroughly dogmatical person and always were I like <PERSON>William</PERSON> better than you <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> is well enough in his own house said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I have seen him as quiet as a lamb at home There is not a better nor a kinder husband in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> He does not dogmatize to his wife My wife is a hard working plain woman time and trouble has ta en all the conceit out of her But that is not the case with you young misses And then you reckon to have so much knowledge and i my thoughts it s only superficial sort o vanities you re acquainted with I can tell happen a year sin one day Miss <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> coming into our counting house when I war packing up summat behind t great desk and she didn t see me and she brought a slate wi a sum on it to t maister It war only a bit of a sum in practice that our Harry would have settled i two minutes She couldn t do it Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had to show her how And when he did show her she couldn t understand him Nonsense <PERSON>Joe Nay</PERSON> it s no nonsense And Miss <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> there reckons to hearken to t maister when he s talking ower trade so attentive like as if she followed him word for word and all war as clear as a lady s looking glass to her een and all t while she s peeping and peeping out o t window to see if t mare stands quiet and then looking at a bit of a splash on her riding skirt and then glancing glegly round at wer counting house cobwebs and dust and thinking what mucky folk we are and what a grand ride she ll have just i now ower Nunnely Common She hears no more o Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s talk nor if he spake Hebrew Joe you are a real slanderer I would give you your answer only the people are coming out of church We must leave you Man of prejudice good bye <PERSON>William</PERSON> good bye Children come up to <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> to morrow and you shall choose what you like best out of <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> s store room CHAPTER XIX A SUMMER NIGHT The hour was now that of dusk A clear air favoured the kindling of the stars There will be just light enough to show me the way home said <PERSON>Miss Keeldar</PERSON> as she prepared to take leave of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> at the rectory garden door You must not go alone <PERSON>Shirley Fanny</PERSON> shall accompany you That she shall not Of what need I be afraid in my own parish I would walk from <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> to the church any fine midsummer night three hours later than this for the mere pleasure of seeing the stars and the chance of meeting a fairy But just wait till the crowd is cleared away Agreed There are the five Misses <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> streaming by Here comes <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> s phaeton Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> s close carriage Mrs Birtwhistle s car I don t wish to go through the ceremony of bidding them all good bye so we will step into the garden and take shelter amongst the laburnums for an instant The rectors their curates and their churchwardens now issued from the church porch There was a great confabulation shaking of hands congratulation on speeches recommendation to be careful of the night air etc By degrees the throng dispersed the carriages drove off Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was just emerging from her flowery refuge when Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> entered the garden and met her Oh I want you he said I was afraid you were already gone <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> come here <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> came expecting as <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> did a lecture on not having been visible at church Other subjects however occupied the rector s mind I shall not sleep at home to night he continued I have just met with an old friend and promised to accompany him I shall return probably about noon to morrow <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> the clerk is engaged and I cannot get him to sleep in the house as I usually do when I am absent for a night Now Now interrupted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> you want me as a gentleman the first gentleman in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> in short to supply your place be master of the rectory and guardian of your niece and maids while you are away Exactly captain I thought the post would suit you Will you favour <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> so far as to be her guest for one night Will you stay here instead of going back to Fieldhead And what will Mrs Pryor do she expects me home I will send her word Come make up your mind to stay It grows late the dew falls heavily You and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> will enjoy each other s society I doubt not I promise you then to stay with <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> replied <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> As you say we shall enjoy each other s society We will not be separated to night Now rejoin your old friend and fear nothing for us If there should chance to be any disturbance in the night captain if you should hear the picking of a lock the cutting out of a pane of glass a stealthy tread of steps about the house and I need not fear to tell _you_ who bear a well tempered mettlesome heart under your girl s ribbon sash that such little incidents are very possible in the present time what would you do <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t know faint perhaps fall down and have to be picked up again But doctor if you assign me the post of honour you must give me arms What weapons are there in your stronghold You could not wield a sword No I could manage the carving knife better You will find a good one in the dining room sideboard a lady s knife light to handle and as sharp pointed as a poniard It will suit Caroline But you must give me a brace of pistols I know you have pistols I have two pairs One pair I can place at your disposal You will find them suspended over the mantelpiece of my study in cloth cases Loaded Yes but not on the cock Cock them before you go to bed It is paying you a great compliment captain to lend you these Were you one of the awkward squad you should not have them I will take care You need delay no longer Mr Helstone You may go now He is gracious to me to lend me his pistols she remarked as the rector passed out at the garden gate But come <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> she continued let us go in and have some supper I was too much vexed at tea with the vicinage of Mr <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> to be able to eat and now I am really hungry Entering the house they repaired to the darkened dining room through the open windows of which apartment stole the evening air bearing the perfume of flowers from the garden the very distant sound of far retreating steps from the road and a soft vague murmur whose origin <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> explained by the remark uttered as she stood listening at the casement <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I hear the beck in the Hollow Then she rang the bell asked for a candle and some bread and milk Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s usual supper and her own <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> when she brought in the tray would have closed the windows and the shutters but was requested to desist for the present The twilight was too calm its breath too balmy to be yet excluded They took their meal in silence <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rose once to remove to the window sill a glass of flowers which stood on the sideboard the exhalation from the blossoms being somewhat too powerful for the sultry room In returning she half opened a drawer and took from it something that glittered clear and keen in her hand You assigned this to me then <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> did you It is bright keen edged finely tapered it is dangerous looking I never yet felt the impulse which could move me to direct this against a fellow creature It is difficult to fancy that circumstances could nerve my arm to strike home with this long knife I should hate to do it replied <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> but I think I could do it if goaded by certain exigencies which I can imagine And Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> quietly sipped her glass of new milk looking somewhat thoughtful and a little pale though indeed when did she not look pale She was never florid The milk sipped and the bread eaten <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> was again summoned She and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> were recommended to go to bed which they were quite willing to do being weary of the day s exertions of much cutting of currant buns and filling of urns and teapots and running backwards and forwards with trays Ere long the maids chamber door was heard to close <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> took a candle and went quietly all over the house seeing that every window was fast and every door barred She did not even evade the haunted back kitchen nor the vault like cellars These visited she returned There is neither spirit nor flesh in the house at present she said which should not be there It is now near eleven o clock fully bedtime yet I would rather sit up a little longer if you do not object <PERSON>Shirley Here</PERSON> she continued I have brought the brace of pistols from my uncle s study You may examine them at your leisure She placed them on the table before her friend Why would you rather sit up longer asked Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> taking up the firearms examining them and again laying them down Because I have a strange excited feeling in my heart So have I Is this state of sleeplessness and restlessness caused by something electrical in the air I wonder No the sky is clear the stars numberless It is a fine night But very still I hear the water fret over its stony bed in Hollow s Copse as distinctly as if it ran below the churchyard wall I am glad it is so still a night A moaning wind or rushing rain would vex me to fever just now Why <PERSON>Shirley Because</PERSON> it would baffle my efforts to listen Do you listen towards the Hollow Yes it is the only quarter whence we can hear a sound just now The only one <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> They both sat near the window and both leaned their arms on the sill and both inclined their heads towards the open lattice They saw each other s young faces by the starlight and that dim June twilight which does not wholly fade from the west till dawn begins to break in the east Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> thinks we have no idea which way he is gone murmured Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> nor on what errand nor with what expectations nor how prepared But I guess much do not you I guess something All those gentlemen your cousin <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> included think that you and I are now asleep in our beds unconscious Caring nothing about them hoping and fearing nothing for them added <PERSON>Caroline Both</PERSON> kept silent for full half an hour The night was silent too only the church clock measured its course by quarters Some words were interchanged about the chill of the air They wrapped their scarves closer round them resumed their bonnets which they had removed and again watched Towards midnight the teasing monotonous bark of the house dog disturbed the quietude of their vigil <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rose and made her way noiselessly through the dark passages to the kitchen intending to appease him with a piece of bread She succeeded On returning to the dining room she found it all dark Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> having extinguished the candle The outline of her shape was visible near the still open window leaning out Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> asked no questions she stole to her side The dog recommenced barking furiously Suddenly he stopped and seemed to listen The occupants of the dining room listened too and not merely now to the flow of the mill stream There was a nearer though a muffled sound on the road below the churchyard a measured beating approaching sound a dull tramp of marching feet It drew near Those who listened by degrees comprehended its extent It was not the tread of two nor of a dozen nor of a score of men it was the tread of hundreds They could see nothing the high shrubs of the garden formed a leafy screen between them and the road To hear however was not enough and this they felt as the troop trod forwards and seemed actually passing the rectory They felt it more when a human voice though that voice spoke but one word broke the hush of the night Halt A halt followed The march was arrested Then came a low conference of which no word was distinguishable from the dining room We _must_ hear this said <PERSON>Shirley She</PERSON> turned took her pistols from the table silently passed out through the middle window of the dining room which was in fact a glass door stole down the walk to the garden wall and stood listening under the lilacs <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> would not have quitted the house had she been alone but where <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> went she would go She glanced at the weapon on the sideboard but left it behind her and presently stood at her friend s side They dared not look over the wall for fear of being seen they were obliged to crouch behind it They heard these words It looks a rambling old building Who lives in it besides the damned parson Only three women his niece and two servants Do you know where they sleep The lasses behind the niece in a front room And <PERSON>Helstone Yonder</PERSON> is his chamber He was burning a light but I see none now Where would you get in If I were ordered to do his job and he desarves it I d try yond long window it opens to the dining room I could grope my way upstairs and I know his chamber How would you manage about the women folk Let em alone except they shrieked and then I d soon quieten em I could wish to find the old chap asleep If he waked he d be dangerous Has he arms Firearms allus and allus loadened Then you re a fool to stop us here A shot would give the alarm <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> would be on us before we could turn round We should miss our main object You might go on I tell you I d engage <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> alone A pause One of the party dropped some weapon which rang on the stone causeway At this sound the rectory dog barked again furiously fiercely That spoils all said the voice He ll awake A noise like that might rouse the dead You did not say there was a dog Damn you Forward Forward they went tramp tramp with mustering manifold slow filing tread They were gone <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> stood erect looked over the wall along the road Not a soul remains she said She stood and mused Thank <PERSON>God</PERSON> was the next observation Caroline repeated the ejaculation not in so steady a tone She was trembling much Her heart was beating fast and thick her face was cold her forehead damp Thank <PERSON>God</PERSON> for us she reiterated But what will happen elsewhere They have passed us by that they may make sure of others They have done well returned <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> with composure The others will defend themselves They can do it They are prepared for them With us it is otherwise My finger was on the trigger of this pistol I was quite ready to give that man if he had entered such a greeting as he little calculated on but behind him followed three hundred I had neither three hundred hands nor three hundred weapons I could not have effectually protected either you myself or the two poor women asleep under that roof Therefore I again earnestly thank God for insult and peril escaped After a second pause she continued What is it my duty and wisdom to do next Not to stay here inactive I am glad to say but of course to walk over to the Hollow To the Hollow Shirley To the Hollow Will you go with me Where those men are gone They have taken the highway we should not encounter them The road over the fields is as safe silent and solitary as a path through the air would be Will you go Yes was the answer given mechanically not because the speaker wished or was prepared to go or indeed was otherwise than scared at the prospect of going but because she felt she could not abandon <PERSON>Shirley Then</PERSON> we must fasten up these windows and leave all as secure as we can behind us Do you know what we are going for Cary Yes no because you wish it Is that all And are you so obedient to a mere caprice of mine What a docile wife you would make to a stern husband The moon s face is not whiter than yours at this moment and the aspen at the gate does not tremble more than your busy fingers and so tractable and terror struck and dismayed and devoted you would follow me into the thick of real danger <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> let me give your fidelity a motive We are going for <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s sake to see if we can be of use to him to make an effort to warn him of what is coming To be sure I am a blind weak fool and you are acute and sensible <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I will go with you I will gladly go with you I do not doubt it You would die blindly and meekly for me but you would intelligently and gladly die for <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> But in truth there is no question of death to night we run no risk at all <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rapidly closed shutter and lattice Do not fear that I shall not have breath to run as fast as you can possibly run <PERSON>Shirley Take</PERSON> my hand Let us go straight across the fields But you cannot climb walls To night I can You are afraid of hedges and the beck which we shall be forced to cross I can cross it They started they ran Many a wall checked but did not baffle them <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was surefooted and agile she could spring like a deer when she chose <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> more timid and less dexterous fell once or twice and bruised herself but she rose again directly saying she was not hurt A quickset hedge bounded the last field they lost time in seeking a gap in it The aperture when found was narrow but they worked their way through The long hair the tender skin the silks and the muslins suffered but what was chiefly regretted was the impediment this difficulty had caused to speed On the other side they met the beck flowing deep in a rough bed At this point a narrow plank formed the only bridge across it <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had trodden the plank successfully and fearlessly many a time before <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had never yet dared to risk the transit I will carry you across said Miss Keeldar You are light and I am not weak Let me try If I fall in you may fish me out was the answer as a grateful squeeze compressed her hand <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> without pausing trod forward on the trembling plank as if it were a continuation of the firm turf <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> who followed did not cross it more resolutely or safely In their present humour on their present errand a strong and foaming channel would have been a barrier to neither At the moment they were above the control either of fire or water All Stilbro Moor alight and aglow with bonfires would not have stopped them nor would Calder or Aire thundering in flood Yet one sound made them pause Scarce had they set foot on the solid opposite bank when a shot split the air from the north One second elapsed Further off burst a like note in the south Within the space of three minutes similar signals boomed in the east and west I thought we were dead at the first explosion observed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> drawing a long breath I felt myself hit in the temples and I concluded your heart was pierced but the reiterated voice was an explanation Those are signals it is their way the attack must be near We should have had wings Our feet have not borne us swiftly enough A portion of the copse was now to clear When they emerged from it the mill lay just below them They could look down upon the buildings the yard they could see the road beyond And the first glance in that direction told <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> she was right in her conjecture They were already too late to give warning It had taken more time than they calculated on to overcome the various obstacles which embarrassed the short cut across the fields The road which should have been white was dark with a moving mass The rioters were assembled in front of the closed yard gates and a single figure stood within apparently addressing them The mill itself was perfectly black and still There was neither life light nor motion around it Surely he is prepared Surely that is not <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> meeting them alone whispered <PERSON>Shirley It</PERSON> is We must go to him I _will_ go to him _That_ you will not Why did I come then I came only for him I shall join him Fortunately it is out of your power There is no entrance to the yard There _is_ a small entrance at the back besides the gates in front It opens by a secret method which I know I will try it Not with my leave Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> clasped her round the waist with both arms and held her back Not one step shall you stir she went on authoritatively At this moment <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> would be both shocked and embarrassed if he saw either you or me Men never want women near them in time of real danger I would not trouble I would help him was the reply How by inspiring him with heroism Pooh these are not the days of chivalry It is not a tilt at a tournament we are going to behold but a struggle about money and food and life It is natural that I should be at his side As queen of his heart His mill is his lady love <PERSON>Cary Backed</PERSON> by his factory and his frames he has all the encouragement he wants or can know It is not for love or beauty but for ledger and broadcloth he is going to break a spear <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t be sentimental <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is not so I _could_ help him I _will_ seek him Off then I let you go seek <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> You ll not find him She loosened her hold <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sped like levelled shaft from bent bow after her rang a jesting gibing laugh Look well there is no mistake was the warning given But there _was_ a mistake Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> paused hesitated gazed The figure had suddenly retreated from the gate and was running back hastily to the mill Make haste <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> cried <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> meet him before he enters <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> slowly returned It is not <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> she said It has neither his height form nor bearing I saw it was not <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> when I let you go How could you imagine it It is a shabby little figure of a private soldier they had posted him as sentinel He is safe in the mill now I saw the door open and admit him My mind grows easier <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is prepared Our warning would have been superfluous and now I am thankful we came too late to give it It has saved us the trouble of a scene How fine to have entered the counting house _toute perdue_ and to have found oneself in presence of <PERSON>Messrs Armitage</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramsden</PERSON> smoking <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> swaggering your uncle sneering Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> sipping a cordial and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> himself in his cold man of business vein I am glad we missed it all I wonder if there are many in the mill Shirley Plenty to defend it The soldiers we have twice seen to day were going there no doubt and the group we noticed surrounding your cousin in the fields will be with him What are they doing now <PERSON>Shirley What</PERSON> is that noise Hatchets and crowbars against the yard gates They are forcing them Are you afraid No but my heart throbs fast I have a difficulty in standing I will sit down Do you feel unmoved Hardly that but I am glad I came We shall see what transpires with our own eyes We are here on the spot and none know it Instead of amazing the curate the clothier and the corn dealer with a romantic rush on the stage we stand alone with the friendly night its mute stars and these whispering trees whose report our friends will not come to gather <PERSON>Shirley Shirley</PERSON> the gates are down That crash was like the felling of great trees Now they are pouring through They will break down the mill doors as they have broken the gate What can <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> do against so many Would to God I were a little nearer him could hear him speak could speak to him With my will my longing to serve him I could not be a useless burden in his way I could be turned to some account They come on cried <PERSON>Shirley How</PERSON> steadily they march in There is discipline in their ranks I will not say there is courage hundreds against tens are no proof of that quality but she dropped her voice there is suffering and desperation enough amongst them These goads will urge them forwards Forwards against <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and they hate him <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> is there much danger they will win the day We shall see <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and Helstone are of earth s first blood no bunglers no cravens A crash smash shiver stopped their whispers A simultaneously hurled volley of stones had saluted the broad front of the mill with all its windows and now every pane of every lattice lay in shattered and pounded fragments A yell followed this demonstration a rioters yell a north of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> a <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> a West Riding a West Riding clothing district of <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> rioters yell You never heard that sound perhaps reader So much the better for your ears perhaps for your heart since if it rends the air in hate to yourself or to the men or principles you approve the interests to which you wish well wrath wakens to the cry of hate the lion shakes his mane and rises to the howl of the hyena caste stands up ireful against caste and the indignant wronged spirit of the middle rank bears down in zeal and scorn on the famished and furious mass of the operative class It is difficult to be tolerant difficult to be just in such moments <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rose <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> put her arm round her they stood together as still as the straight stems of two trees That yell was a long one and when it ceased the night was yet full of the swaying and murmuring of a crowd What next was the question of the listeners Nothing came yet The mill remained mute as a mausoleum He _cannot_ be alone whispered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I would stake all I have that he is as little alone as he is alarmed responded <PERSON>Shirley Shots</PERSON> were discharged by the rioters Had the defenders waited for this signal It seemed so The hitherto inert and passive mill woke fire flashed from its empty window frames a volley of musketry pealed sharp through the Hollow <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> speaks at last said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and he seems to have the gift of tongues That was not a single voice He has been forbearing No one can accuse him of rashness alleged Caroline Their discharge preceded his They broke his gates and his windows They fired at his garrison before he repelled them What was going on now It seemed difficult in the darkness to distinguish but something terrible a still renewing tumult was obvious fierce attacks desperate repulses The mill yard the mill itself was full of battle movement There was scarcely any cessation now of the discharge of firearms and there was struggling rushing trampling and shouting between The aim of the assailants seemed to be to enter the mill that of the defenders to beat them off They heard the rebel leader cry To the back lads They heard a voice retort Come round we will meet you To the counting house was the order again Welcome we shall have you there was the response And accordingly the fiercest blaze that had yet glowed the loudest rattle that had yet been heard burst from the counting house front when the mass of rioters rushed up to it The voice that had spoken was <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s own voice They could tell by its tones that his soul was now warm with the conflict they could guess that the fighting animal was roused in every one of those men there struggling together and was for the time quite paramount above the rational human being Both the girls felt their faces glow and their pulses throb both knew they would do no good by rushing down into the _m l e_ They desired neither to deal nor to receive blows but they could not have run away <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> no more than <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> they could not have fainted they could not have taken their eyes from the dim terrible scene from the mass of cloud of smoke the musket lightning for the world How and when would it end was the demand throbbing in their throbbing pulses Would a juncture arise in which they could be useful was what they waited to see for though <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> put off their too late arrival with a jest and was ever ready to satirize her own or any other person s enthusiasm she would have given a farm of her best land for a chance of rendering good service The chance was not vouchsafed her the looked for juncture never came It was not likely <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had expected this attack for days perhaps weeks he was prepared for it at every point He had fortified and garrisoned his mill which in itself was a strong building He was a cool brave man he stood to the defence with unflinching firmness Those who were with him caught his spirit and copied his demeanour The rioters had never been so met before At other mills they had attacked they had found no resistance an organized resolute defence was what they never dreamed of encountering When their leaders saw the steady fire kept up from the mill witnessed the composure and determination of its owner heard themselves coolly defied and invited on to death and beheld their men falling wounded round them they felt that nothing was to be done here In haste they mustered their forces drew them away from the building A roll was called over in which the men answered to figures instead of names They dispersed wide over the fields leaving silence and ruin behind them The attack from its commencement to its termination had not occupied an hour Day was by this time approaching the west was dim the east beginning to gleam It would have seemed that the girls who had watched this conflict would now wish to hasten to the victors on whose side all their interest had been enlisted but they only very cautiously approached the now battered mill and when suddenly a number of soldiers and gentlemen appeared at the great door opening into the yard they quickly stepped aside into a shed the deposit of old iron and timber whence they could see without being seen It was no cheering spectacle These premises were now a mere blot of desolation on the fresh front of the summer dawn All the copse up the Hollow was shady and dewy the hill at its head was green but just here in the centre of the sweet glen Discord broken loose in the night from control had beaten the ground with his stamping hoofs and left it waste and pulverized The mill yawned all ruinous with unglazed frames the yard was thickly bestrewn with stones and brickbats and close under the mill with the glittering fragments of the shattered windows muskets and other weapons lay here and there More than one deep crimson stain was visible on the gravel a human body lay quiet on its face near the gates and five or six wounded men writhed and moaned in the bloody dust Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s countenance changed at this view It was the after taste of the battle death and pain replacing excitement and exertion It was the blackness the bright fire leaves when its blaze is sunk its warmth failed and its glow faded This is what I wished to prevent she said in a voice whose cadence betrayed the altered impulse of her heart But you could not prevent it you did your best it was in vain said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> comfortingly <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t grieve <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I am sorry for those poor fellows was the answer while the spark in her glance dissolved to dew Are any within the mill hurt I wonder Is that your uncle It is and there is Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> and O <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> there is <PERSON>Robert Well</PERSON> resuming her former tone don t squeeze your fingers quite into my hand I see There is nothing wonderful in that We knew he at least was here whoever might be absent He is coming here towards us <PERSON>Shirley Towards</PERSON> the pump that is to say for the purpose of washing his hands and his forehead which has got a scratch I perceive He bleeds <PERSON>Shirley Don</PERSON> t hold me I must go Not a step He is hurt <PERSON>Shirley Fiddlestick</PERSON> But I _must_ go to him I wish to go so much I cannot bear to be restrained What for To speak to him to ask how he is and what I can do for him To tease and annoy him to make a spectacle of yourself and him before those soldiers Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> your uncle et cetera Would he like it think you Would you like to remember it a week hence Am I always to be curbed and kept down demanded <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> a little passionately For his sake yes and still more for your own I tell you if you showed yourself now you would repent it an hour hence and so would <PERSON>Robert You</PERSON> think he would not like it <PERSON>Shirley Far</PERSON> less than he would like our stopping him to say good night which you were so sore about But that was all play there was no danger And this is serious work he must be unmolested I only wish to go to him because he is my cousin you understand I quite understand But now watch him He has bathed his forehead and the blood has ceased trickling His hurt is really a mere graze I can see it from hence He is going to look after the wounded men Accordingly Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> went round the yard examining each prostrate form They then gave directions to have the wounded taken up and carried into the mill This duty being performed <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> was ordered to saddle his master s horse and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s pony and the two gentlemen rode away full gallop to seek surgical aid in different directions <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was not yet pacified <PERSON>Shirley Shirley</PERSON> I should have liked to speak one word to him before he went she murmured while the tears gathered glittering in her eyes Why do you cry <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> asked Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> a little sternly You ought to be glad instead of sorry <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> has escaped any serious harm he is victorious he has been cool and brave in combat he is now considerate in triumph Is this a time are these causes for weeping You do not know what I have in my heart pleaded the other what pain what distraction nor whence it arises I can understand that you should exult in <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s greatness and goodness so do I in one sense but in another I feel _so_ miserable I am too far removed from him I used to be nearer Let me alone <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Do let me cry a few minutes it relieves me Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> feeling her tremble in every limb ceased to expostulate with her She went out of the shed and left her to weep in peace It was the best plan In a few minutes <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rejoined her much calmer She said with her natural docile gentle manner Come <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> we will go home now I promise not to try to see <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> again till he asks for me I never will try to push myself on him I thank you for restraining me just now I did it with a good intention returned Miss Keeldar Now dear <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> she continued let us turn our faces to the cool morning breeze and walk very quietly back to the rectory We will steal in as we stole out None shall know where we have been or what we have seen to night neither taunt nor misconstruction can consequently molest us To morrow we will see <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and be of good cheer but I will say no more lest I should begin to cry too I seem hard towards you but I am not so CHAPTER XX TO MORROW The two girls met no living soul on their way back to the rectory They let themselves in noiselessly they stole upstairs unheard the breaking morning gave them what light they needed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> sought her couch immediately and though the room was strange for she had never slept at the rectory before and though the recent scene was one unparalleled for excitement and terror by any it had hitherto been her lot to witness yet scarce was her head laid on the pillow ere a deep refreshing sleep closed her eyes and calmed her senses Perfect health was <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s enviable portion Though warm hearted and sympathetic she was not nervous powerful emotions could rouse and sway without exhausting her spirit The tempest troubled and shook her while it lasted but it left her elasticity unbent and her freshness quite unblighted As every day brought her stimulating emotion so every night yielded her recreating rest <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> now watched her sleeping and read the serenity of her mind in the beauty of her happy countenance For herself being of a different temperament she could not sleep The commonplace excitement of the tea drinking and school gathering would alone have sufficed to make her restless all night the effect of the terrible drama which had just been enacted before her eyes was not likely to quit her for days It was vain even to try to retain a recumbent posture she sat up by <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s side counting the slow minutes and watching the June sun mount the heavens Life wastes fast in such vigils as <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had of late but too often kept vigils during which the mind having no pleasant food to nourish it no manna of hope no hived honey of joyous memories tries to live on the meagre diet of wishes and failing to derive thence either delight or support and feeling itself ready to perish with craving want turns to philosophy to resolution to resignation calls on all these gods for aid calls vainly is unheard unhelped and languishes <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was a Christian therefore in trouble she framed many a prayer after the Christian creed preferred it with deep earnestness begged for patience strength relief This world however we all know is the scene of trial and probation and for any favourable result her petitions had yet wrought it seemed to her that they were unheard and unaccepted She believed sometimes that God had turned His face from her At moments she was a Calvinist and sinking into the gulf of religious despair she saw darkening over her the doom of reprobation Most people have had a period or periods in their lives when they have felt thus forsaken when having long hoped against hope and still seen the day of fruition deferred their hearts have truly sickened within them This is a terrible hour but it is often that darkest point which precedes the rise of day that turn of the year when the icy January wind carries over the waste at once the dirge of departing winter and the prophecy of coming spring The perishing birds however cannot thus understand the blast before which they shiver and as little can the suffering soul recognize in the climax of its affliction the dawn of its deliverance Yet let whoever grieves still cling fast to love and faith in God God will never deceive never finally desert him Whom He loveth He chasteneth These words are true and should not be forgotten The household was astir at last the servants were up the shutters were opened below <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as she quitted the couch which had been but a thorny one to her felt that revival of spirits which the return of day of action gives to all but the wholly despairing or actually dying She dressed herself as usual carefully trying so to arrange her hair and attire that nothing of the forlornness she felt at heart should be visible externally She looked as fresh as <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> when both were dressed only that Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s eyes were lively and Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s languid To day I shall have much to say to <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> were <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s first words and you could see in her face that life was full of interest expectation and occupation for her He will have to undergo cross examination she added I dare say he thinks he has outwitted me cleverly And this is the way men deal with women still concealing danger from them thinking I suppose to spare them pain They imagined we little knew where they were to night We _know_ they little conjectured where we were Men I believe fancy women s minds something like those of children Now that is a mistake This was said as she stood at the glass training her naturally waved hair into curls by twining it round her fingers She took up the theme again five minutes after as <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> fastened her dress and clasped her girdle If men could see us as we really are they would be a little amazed but the cleverest the acutest men are often under an illusion about women They do not read them in a true light they misapprehend them both for good and evil Their good woman is a queer thing half doll half angel their bad woman almost always a fiend Then to hear them fall into ecstasies with each other s creations worshipping the heroine of such a poem novel drama thinking it fine divine Fine and divine it may be but often quite artificial false as the rose in my best bonnet there If I spoke all I think on this point if I gave my real opinion of some first rate female characters in first rate works where should I be Dead under a cairn of avenging stones in half an hour <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> you chatter so I can t fasten you Be still And after all authors heroines are almost as good as authoresses heroes Not at all Women read men more truly than men read women I ll prove that in a magazine paper some day when I ve time only it will never be inserted It will be declined with thanks and left for me at the publisher s To be sure You could not write cleverly enough You don t know enough You are not learned <PERSON>Shirley God</PERSON> knows I can t contradict you <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> I m as ignorant as a stone There s one comfort however you are not much better They descended to breakfast I wonder how <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hortense Moore</PERSON> have passed the night said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as she made the coffee Selfish being that I am I never thought of either of them till just now They will have heard all the tumult <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> and the cottage are so near and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> is timid in such matters so no doubt is Mrs Pryor Take my word for it <PERSON>Lina Moore</PERSON> will have contrived to get his sister out of the way She went home with Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> He will have quartered her there for the night As to Mrs Pryor I own I am uneasy about her but in another half hour we will be with her By this time the news of what had happened at the Hollow was spread all over the neighbourhood Fanny who had been to <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> to fetch the milk returned in panting haste with tidings that there had been a battle in the night at Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s mill and that some said twenty men were killed <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> during <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> s absence had been apprised by the butcher s boy that the mill was burnt to the ground Both women rushed into the parlour to announce these terrible facts to the ladies terminating their clear and accurate narrative by the assertion that they were sure master must have been in it all He and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> the clerk they were confident must have gone last night to join Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and the soldiers Mr <PERSON>Malone</PERSON> too had not been heard of at his lodgings since yesterday afternoon and <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> s wife and family were in the greatest distress wondering what had become of their head Scarcely was this information imparted when a knock at the kitchen door announced the Fieldhead errand boy arrived in hot haste bearing a billet from Mrs Pryor It was hurriedly written and urged Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> to return directly as the neighbourhood and the house seemed likely to be all in confusion and orders would have to be given which the mistress of the hall alone could regulate In a postscript it was entreated that Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> might not be left alone at the rectory She had better it was suggested accompany Miss Keeldar There are not two opinions on that head said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> as she tied on her own bonnet and then ran to fetch <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s But what will <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> do And if my uncle returns Your uncle will not return yet he has other fish to fry He will be galloping backwards and forwards from <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> all day rousing the magistrates in the court house and the officers at the barracks and <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> can have in <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> s and the clerk s wives to bear them company Besides of course there is no real danger to be apprehended now Weeks will elapse before the rioters can again rally or plan any other attempt and I am much mistaken if <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> will not take advantage of last night s outbreak to quell them altogether They will frighten the authorities of <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> into energetic measures I only hope they will not be too severe not pursue the discomfited too relentlessly <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> will not be cruel We saw that last night said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> But he will be hard retorted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and so will your uncle As they hurried along the meadow and plantation path to <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> they saw the distant highway already alive with an unwonted flow of equestrians and pedestrians tending in the direction of the usually solitary Hollow On reaching the hall they found the backyard gates open and the court and kitchen seemed crowded with excited milk fetchers men women and children whom <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> the housekeeper appeared vainly persuading to take their milk cans and depart It _is_ or _was_ by the bye the custom in the north of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> for the cottagers on a country squire s estate to receive their supplies of milk and butter from the dairy of the manor house on whose pastures a herd of milch kine was usually fed for the convenience of the neighbourhood Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> owned such a herd all deep dewlapped Craven cows reared on the sweet herbage and clear waters of bonny Airedale and very proud she was of their sleek aspect and high condition Seeing now the state of matters and that it was desirable to effect a clearance of the premises <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> stepped in amongst the gossiping groups She bade them good morning with a certain frank tranquil ease the natural characteristic of her manner when she addressed numbers especially if those numbers belonged to the working class she was cooler amongst her equals and rather proud to those above her She then asked them if they had all got their milk measured out and understanding that they had she further observed that she wondered what they were waiting for then We re just talking a bit over this battle there has been at your mill mistress replied a man Talking a bit Just like you said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> It is a queer thing all the world is so fond of _talking_ over events You _talk_ if anybody dies suddenly you _talk_ if a fire breaks out you _talk_ if a mill owner fails you _talk_ if he s murdered What good does your talking do There is nothing the lower orders like better than a little downright good humoured rating Flattery they scorn very much honest abuse they enjoy They call it speaking plainly and take a sincere delight in being the objects thereof The homely harshness of Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s salutation won her the ear of the whole throng in a second We re no war nor some at is aboon us are we asked a man smiling Nor a whit better You that should be models of industry are just as gossip loving as the idle Fine rich people that have nothing to do may be partly excused for trifling their time away you who have to earn your bread with the sweat of your brow are quite inexcusable That s queer mistress <PERSON>Suld</PERSON> we never have a holiday because we work hard _Never_ was the prompt answer unless added the mistress with a smile that half belied the severity of her speech unless you knew how to make a better use of it than to get together over rum and tea if you are women or over beer and pipes if you are men and _talk_ scandal at your neighbours expense Come friends she added changing at once from bluntness to courtesy oblige me by taking your cans and going home I expect several persons to call to day and it will be inconvenient to have the avenues to the house crowded <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> people are as yielding to persuasion as they are stubborn against compulsion The yard was clear in five minutes Thank you and good bye to you friends said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> as she closed the gates on a quiet court Now let me hear the most refined of cockneys presume to find fault with <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> manners Taken as they ought to be the majority of the lads and lasses of the West Riding are gentlemen and ladies every inch of them It is only against the weak affectation and futile pomposity of a would be aristocrat they turn mutinous Entering by the back way the young ladies passed through the kitchen or _house_ as the inner kitchen is called to the hall <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> came running down the oak staircase to meet them She was all unnerved her naturally sanguine complexion was pale her usually placid though timid blue eye was wandering unsettled alarmed She did not however break out into any exclamations or hurried narrative of what had happened Her predominant feeling had been in the course of the night and was now this morning a sense of dissatisfaction with herself that she could not feel firmer cooler more equal to the demands of the occasion You are aware she began with a trembling voice and yet the most conscientious anxiety to avoid exaggeration in what she was about to say that a body of rioters has attacked Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s mill to night We heard the firing and confusion very plainly here we none of us slept It was a sad night The house has been in great bustle all the morning with people coming and going The servants have applied to me for orders and directions which I really did not feel warranted in giving Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> has I believe sent up for refreshments for the soldiers and others engaged in the defence for some conveniences also for the wounded I could not undertake the responsibility of giving orders or taking measures I fear delay may have been injurious in some instances but this is not my house You were absent my dear Miss Keeldar What could I do Were no refreshments sent asked <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> while her countenance hitherto so clear propitious and quiet even while she was rating the milk fetchers suddenly turned dark and warm I think not my dear And nothing for the wounded no linen no wine no bedding I think not I cannot tell what <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> did but it seemed impossible to me at the moment to venture to dispose of your property by sending supplies to soldiers Provisions for a company of soldiers sounds formidable How many there are I did not ask but I could not think of allowing them to pillage the house as it were I intended to do what was right yet I did not see the case quite clearly I own It lies in a nutshell notwithstanding These soldiers have risked their lives in defence of my property I suppose they have a right to my gratitude The wounded are our fellow creatures I suppose we should aid them Mrs Gill She turned and called in a voice more clear than soft It rang through the thick oak of the hall and kitchen doors more effectually than a bell s summons <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> who was deep in bread making came with hands and apron in culinary case not having dared to stop to rub the dough from the one or to shake the flour from the other Her mistress had never called a servant in that voice save once before and that was when she had seen from the window Tartar in full tug with two carriers dogs each of them a match for him in size if not in courage and their masters standing by encouraging their animals while hers was unbefriended Then indeed she had summoned <PERSON>John</PERSON> as if the Day of Judgment were at hand Nor had she waited for the said <PERSON>John</PERSON> s coming but had walked out into the lane bonnetless and after informing the carriers that she held them far less of men than the three brutes whirling and worrying in the dust before them had put her hands round the thick neck of the largest of the curs and given her whole strength to the essay of choking it from Tartar s torn and bleeding eye just above and below which organ the vengeful fangs were inserted Five or six men were presently on the spot to help her but she never thanked one of them They might have come before if their will had been good she said She had not a word for anybody during the rest of the day but sat near the hall fire till evening watching and tending Tartar who lay all gory stiff and swelled on a mat at her feet She wept furtively over him sometimes and murmured the softest words of pity and endearment in tones whose music the old scarred canine warrior acknowledged by licking her hand or her sandal alternately with his own red wounds As to <PERSON>John</PERSON> his lady turned a cold shoulder on him for a week afterwards <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> remembering this little episode came all of a tremble as she said herself In a firm brief voice Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> proceeded to put questions and give orders That at such a time Fieldhead should have evinced the inhospitality of a miser s hovel stung her haughty spirit to the quick and the revolt of its pride was seen in the heaving of her heart stirred stormily under the lace and silk which veiled it How long is it since that message came from the mill Not an hour yet ma am answered the housekeeper soothingly Not an hour You might almost as well have said not a day They will have applied elsewhere by this time Send a man instantly down to tell them that everything this house contains is at Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s and the soldiers service Do that first While the order was being executed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> moved away from her friends and stood at the hall window silent unapproachable When <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> came back she turned The purple flush which painful excitement kindles on a pale cheek glowed on hers the spark which displeasure lights in a dark eye fired her glance Let the contents of the larder and the wine cellar be brought up put into the hay carts and driven down to the Hollow If there does not happen to be much bread or much meat in the house go to the butcher and baker and desire them to send what they have But I will see for myself She moved off All will be right soon she will get over it in an hour whispered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to Mrs Pryor Go upstairs dear madam she added affectionately and try to be as calm and easy as you can The truth is <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> will blame herself more than you before the day is over By dint of a few more gentle assurances and persuasions Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> contrived to soothe the agitated lady Having accompanied her to her apartment and promised to rejoin her there when things were settled <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> left her to see as she said if she could be useful She presently found that she could be very useful for the retinue of servants at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> was by no means numerous and just now their mistress found plenty of occupation for all the hands at her command and for her own also The delicate good nature and dexterous activity which <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> brought to the aid of the housekeeper and maids all somewhat scared by their lady s unwonted mood did a world of good at once it helped the assistants and appeased the directress A chance glance and smile from <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> moved <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> to an answering smile directly The former was carrying a heavy basket up the cellar stairs This is a shame cried <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> running to her It will strain your arm She took it from her and herself bore it out into the yard The cloud of temper was dispelled when she came back the flash in her eye was melted the shade on her forehead vanished She resumed her usual cheerful and cordial manner to those about her tempering her revived spirits with a little of the softness of shame at her previous unjust anger She was still superintending the lading of the cart when a gentleman entered the yard and approached her ere she was aware of his presence I hope I see Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> well this morning he said examining with rather significant scrutiny her still flushed face She gave him a look and then again bent to her employment without reply A pleasant enough smile played on her lips but she hid it The gentleman repeated his salutation stooping that it might reach her ear with more facility Well enough if she be good enough was the answer and so is Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> too I dare say To speak truth I am not anxious about him some slight mischance would be only his just due His conduct has been we will say _strange_ just now till we have time to characterize it by a more exact epithet Meantime may I ask what brings him here Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and I have just received your message that everything at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> was at our service We judged by the unlimited wording of the gracious intimation that you would be giving yourself too much trouble I perceive our conjecture was correct We are not a regiment remember only about half a dozen soldiers and as many civilians Allow me to retrench something from these too abundant supplies Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> blushed while she laughed at her own over eager generosity and most disproportionate calculations <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> laughed too very quietly though and as quietly he ordered basket after basket to be taken from the cart and remanded vessel after vessel to the cellar The rector must hear of this he said he will make a good story of it What an excellent army contractor Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> would have been Again he laughed adding It is precisely as I conjectured You ought to be thankful said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and not mock me What could I do How could I gauge your appetites or number your band For aught I knew there might have been fifty of you at least to victual You told me nothing and then an application to provision soldiers naturally suggests large ideas It appears so remarked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> levelling another of his keen quiet glances at the discomfited <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Now he continued addressing the carter I think you may take what remains to the Hollow Your load will be somewhat lighter than the one Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> destined you to carry As the vehicle rumbled out of the yard <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> rallying her spirits demanded what had become of the wounded There was not a single man hurt on our side was the answer You were hurt yourself on the temples interposed a quick low voice that of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who having withdrawn within the shade of the door and behind the large person of <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> had till now escaped <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s notice When she spoke his eye searched the obscurity of her retreat Are you much hurt she inquired As you might scratch your finger with a needle in sewing Lift your hair and let us see He took his hat off and did as he was bid disclosing only a narrow slip of court plaster <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> indicated by a slight movement of the head that she was satisfied and disappeared within the clear obscure of the interior How did she know I was hurt asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> By rumour no doubt But it is too good in her to trouble herself about you For my part it was of your victims I was thinking when I inquired after the wounded What damage have your opponents sustained One of the rioters or victims as you call them was killed and six were hurt What have you done with them What you will perfectly approve Medical aid was procured immediately and as soon as we can get a couple of covered wagons and some clean straw they will be removed to <ORGANIZATION>Stilbro Straw</ORGANIZATION> You must have beds and bedding I will send my wagon directly properly furnished and Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> I am sure will send his You guess correctly he has volunteered already And <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> who like you seems disposed to regard the rioters as martyrs and me and especially Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> as murderers is at this moment I believe most assiduously engaged in fitting it up with feather beds pillows bolsters blankets etc The _victims_ lack no attentions I promise you Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> your favourite parson has been with them ever since six o clock exhorting them praying with them and even waiting on them like any nurse and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s good friend Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> that _very_ plain old maid sent in a stock of lint and linen something in the proportion of another lady s allowance of beef and wine That will do Where is your sister Well cared for I had her securely domiciled with Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> This very morning the two set out for Wormwood Wells a noted watering place and will stay there some weeks So Mr Helstone domiciled me at the rectory Mighty clever you gentlemen think you are I make you heartily welcome to the idea and hope its savour as you chew the cud of reflection upon it gives you pleasure Acute and astute why are you not also omniscient How is it that events transpire under your very noses of which you have no suspicion It should be so otherwise the exquisite gratification of outmanoeuvring you would be unknown Ah friend you may search my countenance but you cannot read it <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> indeed looked as if he could not You think me a dangerous specimen of my sex <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t you now A peculiar one at least But <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> is she peculiar In her way yes Her way What is her way You know her as well as I do And knowing her I assert that she is neither eccentric nor difficult of control Is she That depends However there is nothing masculine about _her_ Why lay such emphasis on _her_ Do you consider her a contrast in that respect to yourself You do no doubt but that does not signify <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> is neither masculine nor of what they call the spirited order of women I have seen her flash out So have I but not with manly fire It was a short vivid trembling glow that shot up shone vanished And left her scared at her own daring You describe others besides <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> The point I wish to establish is that Miss Helstone though gentle tractable and candid enough is still perfectly capable of defying even Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s penetration What have you and she been doing asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> suddenly Have you had any breakfast What is your mutual mystery If you are hungry <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> will give you something to eat here Step into the oak parlour and ring the bell You will be served as if at an inn or if you like better go back to the Hollow The alternative is not open to me I _must_ go back Good morning The first leisure I have I will see you again CHAPTER XXI MRS PRYOR While <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was talking with <PERSON>Moore Caroline</PERSON> rejoined <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> upstairs She found that lady deeply depressed She would not say that Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s hastiness had hurt her feelings but it was evident an inward wound galled her To any but a congenial nature she would have seemed insensible to the quiet tender attentions by which Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> sought to impart solace but <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> knew that unmoved or slightly moved as she looked she felt valued and was healed by them I am deficient in self confidence and decision she said at last I always have been deficient in those qualities Yet I think Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> should have known my character well enough by this time to be aware that I always feel an even painful solicitude to do right to act for the best The unusual nature of the demand on my judgment puzzled me especially following the alarms of the night I could not venture to act promptly for another but I trust no serious harm will result from my lapse of firmness A gentle knock was here heard at the door It was half opened <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> come here said a low voice Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> went out There stood <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in the gallery looking contrite ashamed sorry as any repentant child How is <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> she asked Rather out of spirits said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I have behaved very shamefully very ungenerously very ungratefully to her said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> How insolent in me to turn on her thus for what after all was no fault only an excess of conscientiousness on her part But I regret my error most sincerely Tell her so and ask if she will forgive me <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> discharged the errand with heartfelt pleasure Mrs Pryor rose came to the door She did not like scenes she dreaded them as all timid people do She said falteringly Come in my dear <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> did come in with some impetuosity She threw her arms round her governess and while she kissed her heartily she said You know you _must_ forgive me Mrs Pryor I could not get on at all if there was a misunderstanding between you and me I have nothing to forgive was the reply We will pass it over now if you please The final result of the incident is that it proves more plainly than ever how unequal I am to certain crises And that was the painful feeling which _would_ remain on Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> s mind No effort of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s or <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s could efface it thence She could forgive her offending pupil not her innocent self Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> doomed to be in constant request during the morning was presently summoned downstairs again The rector called first A lively welcome and livelier reprimand were at his service He expected both and being in high spirits took them in equally good part In the course of his brief visit he quite forgot to ask after his niece the riot the rioters the mill the magistrates the heiress absorbed all his thoughts to the exclusion of family ties He alluded to the part himself and curate had taken in the defence of the Hollow The vials of pharisaical wrath will be emptied on our heads for our share in this business he said but I defy every calumniator I was there only to support the law to play my part as a man and a Briton which characters I deem quite compatible with those of the priest and <PERSON>Levite</PERSON> in their highest sense Your tenant <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> he went on has won my approbation A cooler commander I would not wish to see nor a more determined Besides the man has shown sound judgment and good sense first in being thoroughly prepared for the event which has taken place and subsequently when his well concerted plans had secured him success in knowing how to use without abusing his victory Some of the magistrates are now well frightened and like all cowards show a tendency to be cruel <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> restrains them with admirable prudence He has hitherto been very unpopular in the neighbourhood but mark my words the tide of opinion will now take a turn in his favour People will find out that they have not appreciated him and will hasten to remedy their error and he when he perceives the public disposed to acknowledge his merits will show a more gracious mien than that with which he has hitherto favoured us Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was about to add to this speech some half jesting half serious warnings to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> on the subject of her rumoured partiality for her talented tenant when a ring at the door announcing another caller checked his raillery and as that other caller appeared in the form of a white haired elderly gentleman with a rather truculent countenance and disdainful eye in short our old acquaintance and the rector s old enemy Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> the priest and <PERSON>Levite</PERSON> seized his hat and with the briefest of adieus to Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and the sternest of nods to her guest took an abrupt leave Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> was in no mild mood and in no measured terms did he express his opinion on the transaction of the night <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> the magistrates the soldiers the mob leaders each and all came in for a share of his invectives but he reserved his strongest epithets and real racy <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Doric</ORGANIZATION> adjectives they were for the benefit of the fighting parsons the sanguinary demoniac rector and curate According to him the cup of ecclesiastical guilt was now full indeed The church he said was in a bonny pickle now It was time it came down when parsons took to swaggering amang soldiers blazing away wi bullet and gunpowder taking the lives of far honester men than themselves What would <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> have done if nobody had helped him asked <PERSON>Shirley Drunk</PERSON> as he d brewed eaten as he d baked Which means you would have left him by himself to face that mob Good He has plenty of courage but the greatest amount of gallantry that ever garrisoned one human breast could scarce avail against two hundred He had the soldiers those poor slaves who hire out their own blood and spill other folk s for money You abuse soldiers almost as much as you abuse clergymen All who wear red coats are national refuse in your eyes and all who wear black are national swindlers Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> according to you did wrong to get military aid and he did still worse to accept of any other aid Your way of talking amounts to this he should have abandoned his mill and his life to the rage of a set of misguided madmen and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and every other gentleman in the parish should have looked on and seen the building razed and its owner slaughtered and never stirred a finger to save either If <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had behaved to his men from the beginning as a master ought to behave they never would have entertained their present feelings towards him Easy for you to talk exclaimed <PERSON>Miss Keeldar</PERSON> who was beginning to wax warm in her tenant s cause you whose family have lived at <LOCATION>Briarmains</LOCATION> for six generations to whose person the people have been accustomed for fifty years who know all their ways prejudices and preferences easy indeed for _you_ to act so as to avoid offending them But Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> came a stranger into the district he came here poor and friendless with nothing but his own energies to back him nothing but his honour his talent and his industry to make his way for him A monstrous crime indeed that under such circumstances he could not popularize his naturally grave quiet manners all at once could not be jocular and free and cordial with a strange peasantry as you are with your fellow townsmen An unpardonable transgression that when he introduced improvements he did not go about the business in quite the most politic way did not graduate his changes as delicately as a rich capitalist might have done For errors of this sort is he to be the victim of mob outrage Is he to be denied even the privilege of defending himself Are those who have the hearts of men in their breasts and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> say what you will of him has such a heart to be reviled like malefactors because they stand by him because they venture to espouse the cause of one against two hundred Come come now be cool said Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> smiling at the earnestness with which <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> multiplied her rapid questions Cool Must I listen coolly to downright nonsense to dangerous nonsense No I like you very well Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> as you know but I thoroughly dislike some of your principles All that cant excuse me but I repeat the word all that _cant_ about soldiers and parsons is most offensive in my ears All ridiculous irrational crying up of one class whether the same be aristocrat or democrat all howling down of another class whether clerical or military all exacting injustice to individuals whether monarch or mendicant is really sickening to me all arraying of ranks against ranks all party hatreds all tyrannies disguised as liberties I reject and wash my hands of _You_ think you are a philanthropist _you_ think you are an advocate of liberty but I will tell you this Mr Hall the parson of Nunnely is a better friend both of man and freedom than <PERSON>Hiram Yorke</PERSON> the reformer of Briarfield From a man Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> would not have borne this language very patiently nor would he have endured it from some women but he accounted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> both honest and pretty and her plain spoken ire amused him Besides he took a secret pleasure in hearing her defend her tenant for we have already intimated he had <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> s interest very much at heart Moreover if he wished to avenge himself for her severity he knew the means lay in his power a word he believed would suffice to tame and silence her to cover her frank forehead with the rosy shadow of shame and veil the glow of her eye under down drooped lid and lash What more hast thou to say he inquired as she paused rather it appeared to take breath than because her subject or her zeal was exhausted Say Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> was the answer the speaker meantime walking fast from wall to wall of the oak parlour say I have a great deal to say if I could get it out in lucid order which I never _can_ do I have to say that your views and those of most extreme politicians are such as none but men in an irresponsible position _can_ advocate that they are purely opposition views meant only to be talked about and never intended to be acted on Make you Prime Minister of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to morrow and you would have to abandon them You abuse <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> for defending his mill Had you been in <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s place you could not with honour or sense have acted otherwise than he acted You abuse Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> for everything he does Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> has his faults he sometimes does wrong but oftener right Were you ordained vicar of <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> you would find it no easy task to sustain all the active schemes for the benefit of the parish planned and persevered in by your predecessor I wonder people cannot judge more fairly of each other and themselves When I hear <PERSON>Messrs Malone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donne</PERSON> chatter about the authority of the church the dignity and claims of the priesthood the deference due to them as clergymen when I hear the outbreaks of their small spite against Dissenters when I witness their silly narrow jealousies and assumptions when their palaver about forms and traditions and superstitions is sounding in my ear when I behold their insolent carriage to the poor their often base servility to the rich I think the Establishment is indeed in a poor way and both she and her sons appear in the utmost need of reformation Turning away distressed from minster tower and village spire ay as distressed as a churchwarden who feels the exigence of white wash and has not wherewithal to purchase lime I recall your senseless sarcasms on the fat bishops the pampered parsons old mother church etc I remember your strictures on all who differ from you your sweeping condemnation of classes and individuals without the slightest allowance made for circumstances or temptations and then Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> doubt clutches my inmost heart as to whether men exist clement reasonable and just enough to be entrusted with the task of reform I don t believe _you_ are of the number You have an ill opinion of me Miss <PERSON>Shirley You</PERSON> never told me so much of your mind before I never had an opening But I have sat on <PERSON>Jessy</PERSON> s stool by your chair in the back parlour at <LOCATION>Briarmains</LOCATION> for evenings together listening excitedly to your talk half admiring what you said and half rebelling against it I think you a fine old Yorkshireman sir I am proud to have been born in the same county and parish as yourself Truthful upright independent you are as a rock based below seas but also you are harsh rude narrow and merciless Not to the poor lass nor to the meek of the earth only to the proud and high minded And what right have you sir to make such distinctions A prouder a higher minded man than yourself does not exist You find it easy to speak comfortably to your inferiors you are too haughty too ambitious too jealous to be civil to those above you But you are all alike <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> also is proud and prejudiced <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> though juster and more considerate than either you or the rector is still haughty stern and in a public sense selfish It is well there are such men as Mr Hall to be found occasionally men of large and kind hearts who can love their whole race who can forgive others for being richer more prosperous or more powerful than they are Such men may have less originality less force of character than you but they are better friends to mankind And when is it to be said Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> now rising When is what to be The wedding Whose wedding Only that of <PERSON>Robert G rard Moore Esq</PERSON> of Hollow s Cottage with Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> daughter and heiress of the late <PERSON>Charles Cave Keeldar</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Fieldhead Hall Shirley</LOCATION> gazed at the questioner with rising colour But the light in her eye was not faltering it shone steadily yes it burned deeply That is your revenge she said slowly then added Would it be a bad match unworthy of the late <PERSON>Charles Cave Keeldar</PERSON> s representative My lass <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is a gentleman his blood is pure and ancient as mine or thine And we two set store by ancient blood We have family pride though one of us at least is a republican <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> bowed as he stood before her His lips were mute but his eye confessed the impeachment Yes he had family pride you saw it in his whole bearing <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> _is_ a gentleman echoed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> lifting her head with glad grace She checked herself Words seemed crowding to her tongue She would not give them utterance but her look spoke much at the moment What <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> tried to read but could not The language was there visible but untranslatable a poem a fervid lyric in an unknown tongue It was not a plain story however no simple gush of feeling no ordinary love confession that was obvious It was something other deeper more intricate than he guessed at He felt his revenge had not struck home He felt that <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> triumphed She held him at fault baffled puzzled _She_ enjoyed the moment not _he_ And if <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> _is_ a gentleman you _can_ be only a lady therefore Therefore there would be no inequality in our union None Thank you for your approbation Will you give me away when I relinquish the name of <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> for that of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> instead of replying gazed at her much puzzled He could not divine what her look signified whether she spoke in earnest or in jest There were purpose and feeling banter and scoff playing mingled on her mobile lineaments I don t understand thee he said turning away She laughed Take courage sir you are not singular in your ignorance But I suppose if <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> understands me that will do will it not <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> may settle his own matters henceforward for me I ll neither meddle nor make with them further A new thought crossed her Her countenance changed magically With a sudden darkening of the eye and austere fixing of the features she demanded Have you been asked to interfere Are you questioning me as another s proxy The Lord save us Whoever weds thee must look about him Keep all your questions for <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> I ll answer no more on em Good day lassie The day being fine or at least fair for soft clouds curtained the sun and a dim but not chill or waterish haze slept blue on the hills <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> while <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was engaged with her callers had persuaded <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> to assume her bonnet and summer shawl and to take a walk with her up towards the narrow end of the Hollow Here the opposing sides of the glen approaching each other and becoming clothed with brushwood and stunted oaks formed a wooded ravine at the bottom of which ran the mill stream in broken unquiet course struggling with many stones chafing against rugged banks fretting with gnarled tree roots foaming gurgling battling as it went Here when you had wandered half a mile from the mill you found a sense of deep solitude found it in the shade of unmolested trees received it in the singing of many birds for which that shade made a home This was no trodden way The freshness of the wood flowers attested that foot of man seldom pressed them the abounding wild roses looked as if they budded bloomed and faded under the watch of solitude as if in a sultan s harem Here you saw the sweet azure of blue bells and recognized in pearl white blossoms spangling the grass a humble type of some starlit spot in space Mrs Pryor liked a quiet walk She ever shunned high roads and sought byways and lonely lanes One companion she preferred to total solitude for in solitude she was nervous a vague fear of annoying encounters broke the enjoyment of quite lonely rambles But she feared nothing with <PERSON>Caroline When</PERSON> once she got away from human habitations and entered the still demesne of nature accompanied by this one youthful friend a propitious change seemed to steal over her mind and beam in her countenance When with <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> only her heart you would have said shook off a burden her brow put aside a veil her spirits too escaped from a restraint With her she was cheerful with her at times she was tender to her she would impart her knowledge reveal glimpses of her experience give her opportunities for guessing what life she had lived what cultivation her mind had received of what calibre was her intelligence how and where her feelings were vulnerable To day for instance as they walked along <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> talked to her companion about the various birds singing in the trees discriminated their species and said something about their habits and peculiarities English natural history seemed familiar to her All the wild flowers round their path were recognized by her tiny plants springing near stones and peeping out of chinks in old walls plants such as <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had scarcely noticed before received a name and an intimation of their properties It appeared that she had minutely studied the botany of English fields and woods Having reached the head of the ravine they sat down together on a ledge of gray and mossy rock jutting from the base of a steep green hill which towered above them She looked round her and spoke of the neighbourhood as she had once before seen it long ago She alluded to its changes and compared its aspect with that of other parts of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> revealing in quiet unconscious touches of description a sense of the picturesque an appreciation of the beautiful or commonplace a power of comparing the wild with the cultured the grand with the tame that gave to her discourse a graphic charm as pleasant as it was unpretending The sort of reverent pleasure with which <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> listened so sincere so quiet yet so evident stirred the elder lady s faculties to gentle animation Rarely probably had she with her chill repellent outside her diffident mien and incommunicative habits known what it was to excite in one whom she herself could love feelings of earnest affection and admiring esteem Delightful doubtless was the consciousness that a young girl towards whom it seemed judging by the moved expression of her eyes and features her heart turned with almost a fond impulse looked up to her as an instructor and clung to her as a friend With a somewhat more marked accent of interest than she often permitted herself to use she said as she bent towards her youthful companion and put aside from her forehead a pale brown curl which had strayed from the confining comb I do hope this sweet air blowing from the hill will do you good my dear <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I wish I could see something more of colour in these cheeks but perhaps you were never florid I had red cheeks once returned Miss Helstone smiling I remember a year two years ago when I used to look in the glass I saw a different face there to what I see now rounder and rosier But when we are young added the girl of eighteen our minds are careless and our lives easy Do you continued <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> mastering by an effort that tyrant timidity which made it difficult for her even under present circumstances to attempt the scrutiny of another s heart do you at your age fret yourself with cares for the future Believe me you had better not Let the morrow take thought for the things of itself True dear madam It is not over the future I pine The evil of the day is sometimes oppressive too oppressive and I long to escape it That is the evil of the day that is your uncle perhaps is not you find it difficult to understand he does not appreciate <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> could not complete her broken sentences she could not manage to put the question whether Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was too harsh with his niece But <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> comprehended Oh that is nothing she replied My uncle and I get on very well We never quarrel I don t call him harsh he never scolds me Sometimes I wish somebody in the world loved me but I cannot say that I particularly wish him to have more affection for me than he has As a child I should perhaps have felt the want of attention only the servants were very kind to me but when people are long indifferent to us we grow indifferent to their indifference It is my uncle s way not to care for women and girls unless they be ladies that he meets in company He could not alter and I have no wish that he should alter as far as I am concerned I believe it would merely annoy and frighten me were he to be affectionate towards me now But you know Mrs Pryor it is scarcely _living_ to measure time as I do at the rectory The hours pass and I get them over somehow but I do not _live_ I endure existence but I rarely enjoy it Since Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and you came I have been I was going to say happier but that would be untrue She paused How untrue You are fond of Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> are you not my dear Very fond of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> I both like and admire her But I am painfully circumstanced For a reason I cannot explain I want to go away from this place and to forget it You told me before you wished to be a governess but my dear if you remember I did not encourage the idea I have been a governess myself great part of my life In Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s acquaintance I esteem myself most fortunate Her talents and her really sweet disposition have rendered my office easy to me but when I was young before I married my trials were severe poignant I should not like a I should not like you to endure similar ones It was my lot to enter a family of considerable pretensions to good birth and mental superiority and the members of which also believed that on them was perceptible an unusual endowment of the Christian graces that all their hearts were regenerate and their spirits in a peculiar state of discipline I was early given to understand that as I was not their equal so I could not expect to have their sympathy It was in no sort concealed from me that I was held a burden and a restraint in society The gentlemen I found regarded me as a tabooed woman to whom they were interdicted from granting the usual privileges of the sex and yet who annoyed them by frequently crossing their path The ladies too made it plain that they thought me a bore The servants it was signified detested me _why_ I could never clearly comprehend My pupils I was told however much they might love me and how deep soever the interest I might take in them could not be my friends It was intimated that I must live alone and never transgress the invisible but rigid line which established the difference between me and my employers My life in this house was sedentary solitary constrained joyless toilsome The dreadful crushing of the animal spirits the ever prevailing sense of friendlessness and homelessness consequent on this state of things began ere long to produce mortal effects on my constitution I sickened The lady of the house told me coolly I was the victim of wounded vanity She hinted that if I did not make an effort to quell my ungodly discontent to cease murmuring against God s appointment and to cultivate the profound humility befitting my station my mind would very likely go to pieces on the rock that wrecked most of my sisterhood morbid self esteem and that I should die an inmate of a lunatic asylum I said nothing to <PERSON>Mrs Hardman</PERSON> it would have been useless but to her eldest daughter I one day dropped a few observations which were answered thus There were hardships she allowed in the position of a governess Doubtless they had their trials but she averred with a manner it makes me smile now to recall but it must be so _She_ Miss H had neither view hope nor _wish_ to see these things remedied for in the inherent constitution of English habits feelings and prejudices there was no possibility that they should be Governesses she observed must ever be kept in a sort of isolation It is the only means of maintaining that distance which the reserve of English manners and the decorum of English families exact I remember I sighed as Miss <PERSON>Hardman</PERSON> quitted my bedside She caught the sound and turning said severely I fear Miss <PERSON>Grey</PERSON> you have inherited in fullest measure the worst sin of our fallen nature the sin of pride You are proud and therefore you are ungrateful too <PERSON>Mamma</PERSON> pays you a handsome salary and if you had average sense you would thankfully put up with much that is fatiguing to do and irksome to bear since it is so well made worth your while Miss <PERSON>Hardman</PERSON> my love was a very strong minded young lady of most distinguished talents The aristocracy are decidedly a very superior class you know both physically and morally and mentally as a high Tory I acknowledge that I could not describe the dignity of her voice and mien as she addressed me thus still I fear she was selfish my dear I would never wish to speak ill of my superiors in rank but I think she was a little selfish I remember continued <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> after a pause another of Miss H s observations which she would utter with quite a grand air WE she would say WE need the imprudences extravagances mistakes and crimes of a certain number of fathers to sow the seed from which WE reap the harvest of governesses The daughters of trades people however well educated must necessarily be underbred and as such unfit to be inmates of OUR dwellings or guardians of OUR children s minds and persons WE shall ever prefer to place those about OUR offspring who have been born and bred with somewhat of the same refinement as OURSELVES Miss <PERSON>Hardman</PERSON> must have thought herself something better than her fellow creatures ma am since she held that their calamities and even crimes were necessary to minister to her convenience You say she was religious Her religion must have been that of the Pharisee who thanked God that he was not as other men are nor even as that publican My dear we will not discuss the point I should be the last person to wish to instil into your mind any feeling of dissatisfaction with your lot in life or any sentiment of envy or insubordination towards your superiors Implicit submission to authorities scrupulous deference to our betters under which term I of course include the higher classes of society are in my opinion indispensable to the well being of every community All I mean to say my dear is that you had better not attempt to be a governess as the duties of the position would be too severe for your constitution Not one word of disrespect would I breathe towards either Mrs or Miss <PERSON>Hardman</PERSON> only recalling my own experience I cannot but feel that were you to fall under auspices such as theirs you would contend a while courageously with your doom then you would pine and grow too weak for your work you would come home if you still had a home broken down Those languishing years would follow of which none but the invalid and her immediate friends feel the heart sickness and know the burden Consumption or decline would close the chapter Such is the history of many a life I would not have it yours My dear we will now walk about a little if you please They both rose and slowly paced a green natural terrace bordering the chasm My dear ere long again began <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> a sort of timid embarrassed abruptness marking her manner as she spoke the young especially those to whom nature has been favourable often frequently anticipate look forward to to marriage as the end the goal of their hopes And she stopped <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> came to her relief with promptitude showing a great deal more self possession and courage than herself on the formidable topic now broached They do and naturally she replied with a calm emphasis that startled Mrs Pryor They look forward to marriage with some one they love as the brightest the only bright destiny that can await them Are they wrong Oh my dear exclaimed <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> clasping her hands and again she paused <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> turned a searching an eager eye on the face of her friend that face was much agitated My dear she murmured life is an illusion But not love Love is real the most real the most lasting the sweetest and yet the bitterest thing we know My dear it is very bitter It is said to be strong strong as death Most of the cheats of existence are strong As to their sweetness nothing is so transitory its date is a moment the twinkling of an eye The sting remains for ever It may perish with the dawn of eternity but it tortures through time into its deepest night Yes it tortures through time agreed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> except when it is mutual love Mutual love My dear romances are pernicious You do not read them I hope Sometimes whenever I can get them indeed But romance writers might know nothing of love judging by the way in which they treat of it Nothing whatever my dear assented Mrs Pryor eagerly nor of marriage and the false pictures they give of those subjects cannot be too strongly condemned They are not like reality They show you only the green tempting surface of the marsh and give not one faithful or truthful hint of the slough underneath But it is not always slough objected <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> There are happy marriages Where affection is reciprocal and sincere and minds are harmonious marriage _must_ be happy It is never wholly happy Two people can never literally be as one There is perhaps a possibility of content under peculiar circumstances such as are seldom combined but it is as well not to run the risk you may make fatal mistakes Be satisfied my dear Let all the single be satisfied with their freedom You echo my uncle s words exclaimed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in a tone of dismay You speak like <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> in her most gloomy moments like Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> when she is most sourly and hypochondriacally disposed This is terrible No it is only true O child you have only lived the pleasant morning time of life the hot weary noon the sad evening the sunless night are yet to come for you Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> you say talks as I talk and I wonder how <PERSON>Mrs Matthewson Helstone</PERSON> would have talked had she been living She died she died And alas my own mother and father exclaimed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> struck by a sombre recollection What of them Did I never tell you that they were separated I have heard it They must then have been very miserable You see all _facts_ go to prove what I say In this case there ought to be no such thing as marriage There ought my dear were it only to prove that this life is a mere state of probation wherein neither rest nor recompense is to be vouchsafed But your own marriage <PERSON>Mrs Pryor Mrs Pryor</PERSON> shrank and shuddered as if a rude finger had pressed a naked nerve <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> felt she had touched what would not bear the slightest contact My marriage was unhappy said the lady summoning courage at last but yet She hesitated But yet suggested <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> not immitigably wretched Not in its results at least No she added in a softer tone God mingles something of the balm of mercy even in vials of the most corrosive woe He can so turn events that from the very same blind rash act whence sprang the curse of half our life may flow the blessing of the remainder Then I am of a peculiar disposition I own that far from facile without address in some points eccentric I ought never to have married Mine is not the nature easily to find a duplicate or likely to assimilate with a contrast I was quite aware of my own ineligibility and if I had not been so miserable as a governess I never should have married and then <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s eyes asked her to proceed They entreated her to break the thick cloud of despair which her previous words had seemed to spread over life And then my dear Mr that is the gentleman I married was perhaps rather an exceptional than an average character I hope at least the experience of few has been such as mine was or that few have felt their sufferings as I felt mine They nearly shook my mind relief was so hopeless redress so unattainable But my dear I do not wish to dishearten I only wish to warn you and to prove that the single should not be too anxious to change their state as they may change for the worse Thank you my dear madam I quite understand your kind intentions but there is no fear of my falling into the error to which you allude I at least have no thoughts of marriage and for that reason I want to make myself a position by some other means My dear listen to me On what I am going to say I have carefully deliberated having indeed revolved the subject in my thoughts ever since you first mentioned your wish to obtain a situation You know I at present reside with Miss Keeldar in the capacity of companion Should she marry and that she _will_ marry ere long many circumstances induce me to conclude I shall cease to be necessary to her in that capacity I must tell you that I possess a small independency arising partly from my own savings and partly from a legacy left me some years since Whenever I leave <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> I shall take a house of my own I could not endure to live in solitude I have no relations whom I care to invite to close intimacy for as you must have observed and as I have already avowed my habits and tastes have their peculiarities To you my dear I need not say I am attached with you I am happier than I have ever been with any living thing this was said with marked emphasis Your society I should esteem a very dear privilege an inestimable privilege a comfort a blessing You shall come to me then <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> do you refuse me I hope you can love me And with these two abrupt questions she stopped Indeed I _do_ love you was the reply I should like to live with you But you are too kind All I have went on <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> I would leave to you You should be provided for But never again say I am _too kind_ You pierce my heart child But my dear madam this generosity I have no claim Hush you must not talk about it There are some things we cannot bear to hear Oh it is late to begin but I may yet live a few years I can never wipe out the past but perhaps a brief space in the future may yet be mine Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> seemed deeply agitated Large tears trembled in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> kissed her in her gentle caressing way saying softly I love you dearly <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t cry But the lady s whole frame seemed shaken She sat down bent her head to her knee and wept aloud Nothing could console her till the inward storm had had its way At last the agony subsided of itself Poor thing she murmured returning <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s kiss poor lonely lamb But come she added abruptly come we must go home For a short distance Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> walked very fast By degrees however she calmed down to her wonted manner fell into her usual characteristic pace a peculiar one like all her movements and by the time they reached <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> she had re entered into herself The outside was as usual still and shy CHAPTER XXII TWO LIVES Only half of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s activity and resolution had been seen in his defence of the mill he showed the other half and a terrible half it was in the indefatigable the relentless assiduity with which he pursued the leaders of the riot The mob the mere followers he let alone Perhaps an innate sense of justice told him that men misled by false counsel and goaded by privations are not fit objects of vengeance and that he who would visit an even violent act on the bent head of suffering is a tyrant not a judge At all events though he knew many of the number having recognized them during the latter part of the attack when day began to dawn he let them daily pass him on street and road without notice or threat The leaders he did not know They were strangers emissaries from the large towns Most of these were not members of the operative class They were chiefly down draughts bankrupts men always in debt and often in drink men who had nothing to lose and much in the way of character cash and cleanliness to gain These persons <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> hunted like any sleuth hound and well he liked the occupation Its excitement was of a kind pleasant to his nature He liked it better than making cloth His horse must have hated these times for it was ridden both hard and often He almost lived on the road and the fresh air was as welcome to his lungs as the policeman s quest to his mood he preferred it to the steam of dye houses The magistrates of the district must have dreaded him They were slow timid men he liked both to frighten and to rouse them He liked to force them to betray a certain fear which made them alike falter in resolve and recoil in action the fear simply of assassination This indeed was the dread which had hitherto hampered every manufacturer and almost every public man in the district Helstone alone had ever repelled it The old Cossack knew well he might be shot He knew there was risk but such death had for his nerves no terrors It would have been his chosen might he have had a choice <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> likewise knew his danger The result was an unquenchable scorn of the quarter whence such danger was to be apprehended The consciousness that he hunted assassins was the spur in his high mettled temper s flank As for fear he was too proud too hard natured if you will too phlegmatic a man to fear Many a time he rode belated over the moors moonlit or moonless as the case might be with feelings far more elate faculties far better refreshed than when safety and stagnation environed him in the counting house Four was the number of the leaders to be accounted for Two in the course of a fortnight were brought to bay near <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> the remaining two it was necessary to seek farther off Their haunts were supposed to lie near <ORGANIZATION>Birmingham Meantime</ORGANIZATION> the clothier did not neglect his battered mill Its reparation was esteemed a light task carpenters and glaziers work alone being needed The rioters not having succeeded in effecting an entrance his grim metal darlings the machines had escaped damage Whether during this busy life whether while stern justice and exacting business claimed his energies and harassed his thoughts he now and then gave one moment dedicated one effort to keep alive gentler fires than those which smoulder in the fane of Nemesis it was not easy to discover He seldom went near <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> if he did his visits were brief If he called at the rectory it was only to hold conferences with the rector in his study He maintained his rigid course very steadily Meantime the history of the year continued troubled There was no lull in the tempest of war her long hurricane still swept the Continent There was not the faintest sign of serene weather no opening amid the clouds of battle dust and smoke no fall of pure dews genial to the olive no cessation of the red rain which nourishes the baleful and glorious laurel Meantime Ruin had her sappers and miners at work under <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s feet and whether he rode or walked whether he only crossed his counting house hearth or galloped over sullen Rushedge he was aware of a hollow echo and felt the ground shake to his tread While the summer thus passed with <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> how did it lapse with <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline Let</PERSON> us first visit the heiress How does she look Like a love lorn maiden pale and pining for a neglectful swain Does she sit the day long bent over some sedentary task Has she for ever a book in her hand or sewing on her knee and eyes only for that and words for nothing and thoughts unspoken By no means <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> is all right If her wistful cast of physiognomy is not gone no more is her careless smile She keeps her dark old manor house light and bright with her cheery presence The gallery and the low ceiled chambers that open into it have learned lively echoes from her voice the dim entrance hall with its one window has grown pleasantly accustomed to the frequent rustle of a silk dress as its wearer sweeps across from room to room now carrying flowers to the barbarous peach bloom salon now entering the dining room to open its casements and let in the scent of mignonette and sweet briar anon bringing plants from the staircase window to place in the sun at the open porch door She takes her sewing occasionally but by some fatality she is doomed never to sit steadily at it for above five minutes at a time Her thimble is scarcely fitted on her needle scarce threaded when a sudden thought calls her upstairs Perhaps she goes to seek some just then remembered old ivory backed needle book or older china topped work box quite unneeded but which seems at the moment indispensable perhaps to arrange her hair or a drawer which she recollects to have seen that morning in a state of curious confusion perhaps only to take a peep from a particular window at a particular view whence Briarfield church and rectory are visible pleasantly bowered in trees She has scarcely returned and again taken up the slip of cambric or square of half wrought canvas when Tartar s bold scrape and strangled whistle are heard at the porch door and she must run to open it for him It is a hot day he comes in panting she must convoy him to the kitchen and see with her own eyes that his water bowl is replenished Through the open kitchen door the court is visible all sunny and gay and people with turkeys and their poults peahens and their chicks pearl flecked <LOCATION>Guinea</LOCATION> fowls and a bright variety of pure white and purple necked and blue and cinnamon plumed pigeons Irresistible spectacle to <PERSON>Shirley She</PERSON> runs to the pantry for a roll and she stands on the door step scattering crumbs Around her throng her eager plump happy feathered vassals <PERSON>John</PERSON> is about the stables and <PERSON>John</PERSON> must be talked to and her mare looked at She is still petting and patting it when the cows come in to be milked This is important <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> must stay and take a review of them all There are perhaps some little calves some little new yeaned lambs it may be twins whose mothers have rejected them Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> must be introduced to them by <PERSON>John</PERSON> must permit herself the treat of feeding them with her own hand under the direction of her careful foreman Meantime <PERSON>John</PERSON> moots doubtful questions about the farming of certain crofts and ings and holmes and his mistress is necessitated to fetch her garden hat a gipsy straw and accompany him over stile and along hedgerow to hear the conclusion of the whole agricultural matter on the spot and with the said crofts ings and holms under her eye Bright afternoon thus wears into soft evening and she comes home to a late tea and after tea she never sews After tea <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> reads and she is just about as tenacious of her book as she is lax of her needle Her study is the rug her seat a footstool or perhaps only the carpet at Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> s feet there she always learned her lessons when a child and old habits have a strong power over her The tawny and lionlike bulk of Tartar is ever stretched beside her his negro muzzle laid on his fore paws straight strong and shapely as the limbs of an Alpine wolf One hand of the mistress generally reposes on the loving serf s rude head because if she takes it away he groans and is discontented <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s mind is given to her book She lifts not her eyes she neither stirs nor speaks unless indeed it be to return a brief respectful answer to <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> who addresses deprecatory phrases to her now and then My dear you had better not have that great dog so near you he is crushing the border of your dress Oh it is only muslin I can put a clean one on to morrow My dear I wish you could acquire the habit of sitting to a table when you read I will try ma am some time but it is so comfortable to do as one has always been accustomed to do My dear let me beg of you to put that book down You are trying your eyes by the doubtful firelight No ma am not at all my eyes are never tired At last however a pale light falls on the page from the window She looks the moon is up She closes the volume rises and walks through the room Her book has perhaps been a good one it has refreshed refilled rewarmed her heart it has set her brain astir furnished her mind with pictures The still parlour the clean hearth the window opening on the twilight sky and showing its sweet regent new throned and glorious suffice to make earth an Eden life a poem for <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> A still deep inborn delight glows in her young veins unmingled untroubled not to be reached or ravished by human agency because by no human agency bestowed the pure gift of God to His creature the free dower of Nature to her child This joy gives her experience of a genii life Buoyant by green steps by glad hills all verdure and light she reaches a station scarcely lower than that whence angels looked down on the dreamer of <LOCATION>Bethel</LOCATION> and her eye seeks and her soul possesses the vision of life as she wishes it No not as she wishes it she has not time to wish The swift glory spreads out sweeping and kindling and multiplies its splendours faster than Thought can effect his combinations faster than Aspiration can utter her longings <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> says nothing while the trance is upon her she is quite mute but if <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> speaks to her now she goes out quietly and continues her walk upstairs in the dim gallery If <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> were not an indolent a reckless an ignorant being she would take a pen at such moments or at least while the recollection of such moments was yet fresh on her spirit She would seize she would fix the apparition tell the vision revealed Had she a little more of the organ of acquisitiveness in her head a little more of the love of property in her nature she would take a good sized sheet of paper and write plainly out in her own queer but clear and legible hand the story that has been narrated the song that has been sung to her and thus possess what she was enabled to create But indolent she is reckless she is and most ignorant for she does not know her dreams are rare her feelings peculiar She does not know has never known and will die without knowing the full value of that spring whose bright fresh bubbling in her heart keeps it green <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> takes life easily Is not that fact written in her eye In her good tempered moments is it not as full of lazy softness as in her brief fits of anger it is fulgent with quick flashing fire Her nature is in her eye So long as she is calm indolence indulgence humour and tenderness possess that large gray sphere incense her a red ray pierces the dew it quickens instantly to flame Ere the month of July was past Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> would probably have started with <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> on that northern tour they had planned but just at that epoch an invasion befell Fieldhead A genteel foraging party besieged <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in her castle and compelled her to surrender at discretion An uncle an aunt and two cousins from the south a Mr Mrs and two Misses Sympson of Sympson Grove shire came down upon her in state The laws of hospitality obliged her to give in which she did with a facility which somewhat surprised <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who knew her to be prompt in action and fertile in expedient where a victory was to be gained for her will Miss Helstone even asked her how it was she submitted so readily She answered old feelings had their power she had passed two years of her early youth at <LOCATION>Sympson Grove How</LOCATION> did she like her relatives She had nothing in common with them she replied <PERSON>Little Harry Sympson</PERSON> indeed the sole son of the family was very unlike his sisters and of him she had formerly been fond but he was not coming to <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> at least not yet The next Sunday the Fieldhead pew in <ORGANIZATION>Briarfield Church</ORGANIZATION> appeared peopled with a prim trim fidgety elderly gentleman who shifted his spectacles and changed his position every three minutes a patient placid looking elderly lady in brown satin and two pattern young ladies in pattern attire with pattern deportment <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had the air of a black swan or a white crow in the midst of this party and very forlorn was her aspect Having brought her into respectable society we will leave her there a while and look after Miss Helstone Separated from Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> for the present as she could not seek her in the midst of her fine relatives scared away from <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> by the visiting commotion which the new arrivals occasioned in the neighbourhood <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was limited once more to the gray rectory the solitary morning walk in remote by paths the long lonely afternoon sitting in a quiet parlour which the sun forsook at noon or in the garden alcove where it shone bright yet sad on the ripening red currants trained over the trellis and on the fair monthly roses entwined between and through them fell chequered on <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sitting in her white summer dress still as a garden statue There she read old books taken from her uncle s library The Greek and Latin were of no use to her and its collection of light literature was chiefly contained on a shelf which had belonged to her aunt <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> some venerable Lady s Magazines that had once performed a sea voyage with their owner and undergone a storm and whose pages were stained with salt water some mad Methodist Magazines full of miracles and apparitions of preternatural warnings ominous dreams and frenzied fanaticism the equally mad letters of <PERSON>Mrs Elizabeth Rowe</PERSON> from the Dead to the Living a few old English classics From these faded flowers <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had in her childhood extracted the honey they were tasteless to her now By way of change and also of doing good she would sew make garments for the poor according to good Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> s direction Sometimes as she felt and saw her tears fall slowly on her work she would wonder how the excellent woman who had cut it out and arranged it for her managed to be so equably serene in _her_ solitude I never find Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> oppressed with despondency or lost in grief she thought yet her cottage is a still dim little place and she is without a bright hope or near friend in the world I remember though she told me once she had tutored her thoughts to tend upwards to heaven She allowed there was and ever had been little enjoyment in this world for her and she looks I suppose to the bliss of the world to come So do nuns with their close cell their iron lamp their robe strait as a shroud their bed narrow as a coffin She says often she has no fear of death no dread of the grave no more doubtless had St <PERSON>Simeon Stylites</PERSON> lifted up terrible on his wild column in the wilderness no more has the Hindu votary stretched on his couch of iron spikes Both these having violated nature their natural likings and antipathies are reversed they grow altogether morbid I do fear death as yet but I believe it is because I am young Poor Miss <PERSON>Ainley</PERSON> would cling closer to life if life had more charms for her God surely did not create us and cause us to live with the sole end of wishing always to die I believe in my heart we were intended to prize life and enjoy it so long as we retain it Existence never was originally meant to be that useless blank pale slow trailing thing it often becomes to many and is becoming to me among the rest Nobody she went on nobody in particular is to blame that I can see for the state in which things are and I cannot tell however much I puzzle over it how they are to be altered for the better but I feel there is something wrong somewhere I believe single women should have more to do better chances of interesting and profitable occupation than they possess now And when I speak thus I have no impression that I displease God by my words that I am either impious or impatient irreligious or sacrilegious My consolation is indeed that God hears many a groan and compassionates much grief which man stops his ears against or frowns on with impotent contempt I say _impotent_ for I observe that to such grievances as society cannot readily cure it usually forbids utterance on pain of its scorn this scorn being only a sort of tinselled cloak to its deformed weakness People hate to be reminded of ills they are unable or unwilling to remedy Such reminder in forcing on them a sense of their own incapacity or a more painful sense of an obligation to make some unpleasant effort troubles their ease and shakes their self complacency Old maids like the houseless and unemployed poor should not ask for a place and an occupation in the world the demand disturbs the happy and rich it disturbs parents Look at the numerous families of girls in this neighbourhood the Armitages the Birtwhistles the Sykeses The brothers of these girls are every one in business or in professions they have something to do Their sisters have no earthly employment but household work and sewing no earthly pleasure but an unprofitable visiting and no hope in all their life to come of anything better This stagnant state of things makes them decline in health They are never well and their minds and views shrink to wondrous narrowness The great wish the sole aim of every one of them is to be married but the majority will never marry they will die as they now live They scheme they plot they dress to ensnare husbands The gentlemen turn them into ridicule they don t want them they hold them very cheap They say I have heard them say it with sneering laughs many a time the matrimonial market is overstocked Fathers say so likewise and are angry with their daughters when they observe their man uvres they order them to stay at home What do they expect them to do at home If you ask they would answer sew and cook They expect them to do this and this only contentedly regularly uncomplainingly all their lives long as if they had no germs of faculties for anything else a doctrine as reasonable to hold as it would be that the fathers have no faculties but for eating what their daughters cook or for wearing what they sew Could men live so themselves Would they not be very weary And when there came no relief to their weariness but only reproaches at its slightest manifestation would not their weariness ferment it time to frenzy <PERSON>Lucretia</PERSON> spinning at midnight in the midst of her maidens and <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> s virtuous woman are often quoted as patterns of what the sex as they say ought to be I don t know <PERSON>Lucretia</PERSON> I dare say was a most worthy sort of person much like my cousin <PERSON>Hortense Moore</PERSON> but she kept her servants up very late I should not have liked to be amongst the number of the maidens <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> would just work me and <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> in that fashion if she could and neither of us would bear it The virtuous woman again had her household up in the very middle of the night she got breakfast over as <PERSON>Mrs Sykes</PERSON> says before one o clock a m but _she_ had something more to do than spin and give out portions She was a manufacturer she made fine linen and sold it she was an agriculturist she bought estates and planted vineyards _That_ woman was a manager She was what the matrons hereabouts call a clever woman On the whole I like her a good deal better than <PERSON>Lucretia</PERSON> but I don t believe either Mr <PERSON>Armitage</PERSON> or Mr <PERSON>Sykes</PERSON> could have got the advantage of her in a bargain Yet I like her Strength and honour were her clothing the heart of her husband safely trusted in her She opened her mouth with wisdom in her tongue was the law of kindness her children rose up and called her blessed her husband also praised her King of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> your model of a woman is a worthy model But are we in these days brought up to be like her <ORGANIZATION>Men of Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> do your daughters reach this royal standard Can they reach it Can you help them to reach it Can you give them a field in which their faculties may be exercised and grow Men of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> look at your poor girls many of them fading around you dropping off in consumption or decline or what is worse degenerating to sour old maids envious back biting wretched because life is a desert to them or what is worst of all reduced to strive by scarce modest coquetry and debasing artifice to gain that position and consideration by marriage which to celibacy is denied Fathers cannot you alter these things Perhaps not all at once but consider the matter well when it is brought before you receive it as a theme worthy of thought do not dismiss it with an idle jest or an unmanly insult You would wish to be proud of your daughters and not to blush for them then seek for them an interest

disgrace to you Cultivate them give them scope and work they will be your gayest companions in health your tenderest nurses in sickness your most faithful prop in age CHAPTER <PERSON>XXIII</PERSON> AN EVENING OUT One fine summer day that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had spent entirely alone her uncle being at <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> and whose long bright noiseless breezeless cloudless hours how many they seemed since sunrise had been to her as desolate as if they had gone over her head in the shadowless and trackless wastes of <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION> instead of in the blooming garden of an English home she was sitting in the alcove her task of work on her knee her fingers assiduously plying the needle her eyes following and regulating their movements her brain working restlessly when <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> came to the door looked round over the lawn and borders and not seeing her whom she sought called out Miss <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> A low voice answered Fanny It issued from the alcove and thither <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> hastened a note in her hand which she delivered to fingers that hardly seemed to have nerve to hold it Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> did not ask whence it came and she did not look at it she let it drop amongst the folds of her work <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> s son <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> brought it said Fanny The girl was no enchantress and knew no magic spell yet what she said took almost magical effect on her young mistress She lifted her head with the quick motion of revived sensation she shot not a languid but a lifelike questioning glance at <PERSON>Fanny Harry Scott</PERSON> who sent him He came from the Hollow The dropped note was snatched up eagerly the seal was broken it was read in two seconds An affectionate billet from <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> informing her young cousin that she was returned from <PERSON>Wormwood Wells</PERSON> that she was alone to day as <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was gone to Whinbury market that nothing would give her greater pleasure than to have <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s company to tea and the good lady added she was quite sure such a change would be most acceptable and beneficial to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who must be sadly at a loss both for safe guidance and improving society since the misunderstanding between <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> had occasioned a separation from her meilleure amie <PERSON>Hortense G rard Moore</PERSON> In a postscript she was urged to put on her bonnet and run down directly <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> did not need the injunction Glad was she to lay by the brown holland child s slip she was trimming with braid for the Jew s basket to hasten upstairs cover her curls with her straw bonnet and throw round her shoulders the black silk scarf whose simple drapery suited as well her shape as its dark hue set off the purity of her dress and the fairness of her face glad was she to escape for a few hours the solitude the sadness the nightmare of her life glad to run down the green lane sloping to the Hollow to scent the fragrance of hedge flowers sweeter than the perfume of moss rose or lily True she knew <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was not at the cottage but it was delight to go where he had lately been So long so totally separated from him merely to see his home to enter the room where he had that morning sat felt like a reunion As such it revived her and then Illusion was again following her in <PERSON>Peri</PERSON> mask The soft agitation of wings caressed her cheek and the air breathing from the blue summer sky bore a voice which whispered <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> may come home while you are in his house and then at least you may look in his face at least you may give him your hand perhaps for a minute you may sit beside him Silence was her austere response but she loved the comforter and the consolation Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> probably caught from the window the gleam and flutter of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s white attire through the branchy garden shrubs for she advanced from the cottage porch to meet her Straight unbending phlegmatic as usual she came on No haste or ecstasy was ever permitted to disorder the dignity of _her_ movements but she smiled well pleased to mark the delight of her pupil to feel her kiss and the gentle genial strain of her embrace She led her tenderly in half deceived and wholly flattered Half deceived had it not been so she would in all probability have put her to the wicket and shut her out Had she known clearly to whose account the chief share of this childlike joy was to be placed <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> would most likely have felt both shocked and incensed Sisters do not like young ladies to fall in love with their brothers It seems if not presumptuous silly weak a delusion an absurd mistake _They_ do not love these gentlemen whatever sisterly affection they may cherish towards them and that others should repels them with a sense of crude romance The first movement in short excited by such discovery as with many parents on finding their children to be in love is one of mixed impatience and contempt Reason if they be rational people corrects the false feeling in time but if they be irrational it is never corrected and the daughter or sister in law is disliked to the end You would expect to find me alone from what I said in my note observed Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> as she conducted <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> towards the parlour but it was written this morning since dinner company has come in And opening the door she made visible an ample spread of crimson skirts overflowing the elbow chair at the fireside and above them presiding with dignity a cap more awful than a crown That cap had never come to the cottage under a bonnet no it had been brought in a vast bag or rather a middle sized balloon of black silk held wide with whalebone The screed or frill of the cap stood a quarter of a yard broad round the face of the wearer The ribbon flourishing in puffs and bows about the head was of the sort called love ribbon There was a good deal of it I may say a very great deal <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> wore the cap it became her she wore the gown also it suited her no less That great lady was come in a friendly way to take tea with Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> It was almost as great and as rare a favour as if the queen were to go uninvited to share pot luck with one of her subjects A higher mark of distinction she could not show she who in general scorned visiting and tea drinking and held cheap and stigmatized as gossips every maid and matron of the vicinage There was no mistake however Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> _was_ a favourite with her She had evinced the fact more than once evinced it by stopping to speak to her in the churchyard on Sundays by inviting her almost hospitably to come to <LOCATION>Briarmains</LOCATION> evinced it to day by the grand condescension of a personal visit Her reasons for the preference as assigned by herself were that Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was a woman of steady deportment without the least levity of conversation or carriage also that being a foreigner she must feel the want of a friend to countenance her She might have added that her plain aspect homely precise dress and phlegmatic unattractive manner were to her so many additional recommendations It is certain at least that ladies remarkable for the opposite qualities of beauty lively bearing and elegant taste in attire were not often favoured with her approbation Whatever gentlemen are apt to admire in women <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> condemned and what they overlook or despise she patronized <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> advanced to the mighty matron with some sense of diffidence She knew little of <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> and as a parson s niece was doubtful what sort of a reception she might get She got a very cool one and was glad to hide her discomfiture by turning away to take off her bonnet Nor upon sitting down was she displeased to be immediately accosted by a little personage in a blue frock and sash who started up like some fairy from the side of the great dame s chair where she had been sitting on a footstool screened from view by the folds of the wide red gown and running to Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> unceremoniously threw her arms round her neck and demanded a kiss My mother is not civil to you said the petitioner as she received and repaid a smiling salute and <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> there takes no notice of you it is their way If instead of you a white angel with a crown of stars had come into the room mother would nod stiffly and <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> never lift her head at all but I will be your friend I have always liked you <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> curb that tongue of yours and repress your forwardness said Mrs Yorke But mother you are so frozen expostulated <PERSON>Jessie Miss Helstone</PERSON> has never done you any harm why can t you be kind to her You sit so stiff and look so cold and speak so dry what for That s just the fashion in which you treat Miss <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> and every other young lady who comes to our house And <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> there is such an aut aut I have forgotten the word but it means a machine in the shape of a human being However between you you will drive every soul away from <PERSON>Briarmains Martin</PERSON> often says so I am an automaton Good Let me alone then said <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> speaking from a corner where she was sitting on the carpet at the foot of a bookcase with a volume spread open on her knee Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> how do you do she added directing a brief glance to the person addressed and then again casting down her gray remarkable eyes on the book and returning to the study of its pages <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> stole a quiet gaze towards her dwelling on her young absorbed countenance and observing a certain unconscious movement of the mouth as she read a movement full of character <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had tact and she had fine instinct She felt that <PERSON>Rose Yorke</PERSON> was a peculiar child one of the unique she knew how to treat her Approaching quietly she knelt on the carpet at her side and looked over her little shoulder at her book It was a romance of Mrs Radcliffe s The Italian <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> read on with her making no remark Presently <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> showed her the attention of asking ere she turned the leaf Are you ready <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> only nodded Do you like it inquired Rose ere long Long since when I read it as a child I was wonderfully taken with it Why It seemed to open with such promise such foreboding of a most strange tale to be unfolded And in reading it you feel as if you were far away from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> really in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> under another sort of sky that blue sky of the south which travellers describe You are sensible of that Rose It makes me long to travel Miss Helstone When you are a woman perhaps you may be able to gratify your wish I mean to make a way to do so if one is not made for me I cannot live always in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> The whole world is not very large compared with creation I must see the outside of our own round planet at least How much of its outside First this hemisphere where we live then the other I am resolved that my life shall be a life Not a black trance like the toad s buried in marble nor a long slow death like yours in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> rectory Like mine what can you mean child Might you not as well be tediously dying as for ever shut up in that glebe house a place that when I pass it always reminds me of a windowed grave I never see any movement about the door I never hear a sound from the wall I believe smoke never issues from the chimneys What do you do there I sew I read I learn lessons Are you happy Should I be happy wandering alone in strange countries as you wish to do Much happier even if you did nothing but wander Remember however that I shall have an object in view but if you only went on and on like some enchanted lady in a fairy tale you might be happier than now In a day s wandering you would pass many a hill wood and watercourse each perpetually altering in aspect as the sun shone out or was overcast as the weather was wet or fair dark or bright Nothing changes in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> rectory The plaster of the parlour ceilings the paper on the walls the curtains carpets chairs are still the same Is change necessary to happiness Yes Is it synonymous with it I don t know but I feel monotony and death to be almost the same Here <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> spoke Isn t she mad she asked But <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> pursued <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I fear a wanderer s life for me at least would end like that tale you are reading in disappointment vanity and vexation of spirit Does The Italian so end I thought so when I read it Better to try all things and find all empty than to try nothing and leave your life a blank To do this is to commit the sin of him who buried his talent in a napkin despicable sluggard <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> observed <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> solid satisfaction is only to be realized by doing one s duty Right mother And if my Master has given me ten talents my duty is to trade with them and make them ten talents more Not in the dust of household drawers shall the coin be interred I will _not_ deposit it in a broken spouted teapot and shut it up in a china closet among tea things I will _not_ commit it to your work table to be smothered in piles of woollen hose I will _not_ prison it in the linen press to find shrouds among the sheets And least of all mother she got up from the floor least of all will I hide it in a tureen of cold potatoes to be ranged with bread butter pastry and ham on the shelves of the larder She stopped then went on Mother the Lord who gave each of us our talents will come home some day and will demand from all an account The teapot the old stocking foot the linen rag the willow pattern tureen will yield up their barren deposit in many a house Suffer your daughters at least to put their money to the exchangers that they may be enabled at the Master s coming to pay Him His own with usury <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> did you bring your sampler with you as I told you Yes mother Sit down and do a line of marking <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> sat down promptly and wrought according to orders After a busy pause of ten minutes her mother asked Do you think yourself oppressed now a victim No mother Yet as far as I understood your tirade it was a protest against all womanly and domestic employment You misunderstood it mother I should be sorry not to learn to sew You do right to teach me and to make me work Even to the mending of your brothers stockings and the making of sheets Yes Where is the use of ranting and spouting about it then Am I to do nothing but that I will do that and then I will do more Now mother I have said my say I am twelve years old at present and not till I am sixteen will I speak again about talents For four years I bind myself an industrious apprentice to all you can teach me You see what my daughters are Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> observed <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> how precociously wise in their own conceits I would rather this I prefer that such is <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> s cuckoo song while <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> utters the bolder cry I _will_ and I will _not_ I render a reason mother besides if my cry is bold it is only heard once in a twelvemonth About each birthday the spirit moves me to deliver one oracle respecting my own instruction and management I utter it and leave it it is for you mother to listen or not I would advise all young ladies pursued <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> to study the characters of such children as they chance to meet with before they marry and have any of their own to consider well how they would like the responsibility of guiding the careless the labour of persuading the stubborn the constant burden and task of training the best But with love it need not be so very difficult interposed <PERSON>Caroline Mothers</PERSON> love their children most dearly almost better than they love themselves Fine talk very sentimental There is the rough practical part of life yet to come for you young miss But <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> if I take a little baby into my arms any poor woman s infant for instance I feel that I love that helpless thing quite peculiarly though I am not its mother I could do almost anything for it willingly if it were delivered over entirely to my care if it were quite dependent on me You _feel_ Yes yes I dare say now You are led a great deal by your _feelings_ and you think yourself a very sensitive personage no doubt Are you aware that with all these romantic ideas you have managed to train your features into an habitually lackadaisical expression better suited to a novel heroine than to a woman who is to make her way in the real world by dint of common sense No I am not at all aware of that Mrs Yorke Look in the glass just behind you Compare the face you see there with that of any early rising hard working milkmaid My face is a pale one but it is _not_ sentimental and most milkmaids however red and robust they may be are more stupid and less practically fitted to make their way in the world than I am I think more and more correctly than milkmaids in general do consequently where they would often for want of reflection act weakly I by dint of reflection should act judiciously Oh no you would be influenced by your feelings you would be guided by impulse Of course I should often be influenced by my feelings They were given me to that end Whom my feelings teach me to love I _must_ and _shall_ love and I hope if ever I have a husband and children my feelings will induce me to love them I hope in that case all my impulses will be strong in compelling me to love <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had a pleasure in saying this with emphasis she had a pleasure in daring to say it in Mrs <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s presence She did not care what unjust sarcasm might be hurled at her in reply She flushed not with anger but excitement when the ungenial matron answered coolly <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t waste your dramatic effects That was well said it was quite fine but it is lost on two women an old wife and an old maid There should have been a disengaged gentleman present Is Mr <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> nowhere hid behind the curtains do you think Miss <PERSON>Moore Hortense</PERSON> who during the chief part of the conversation had been in the kitchen superintending the preparations for tea did not yet quite comprehend the drift of the discourse She answered with a puzzled air that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was at Whinbury Mrs <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> laughed her own peculiar short laugh Straightforward Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said she patronizingly It is like you to understand my question so literally and answer it so simply _Your_ mind comprehends nothing of intrigue Strange things might go on around you without your being the wiser you are not of the class the world calls sharp witted These equivocal compliments did not seem to please <PERSON>Hortense She</PERSON> drew herself up puckered her black eyebrows but still looked puzzled I have ever been noted for sagacity and discernment from childhood she returned for indeed on the possession of these qualities she peculiarly piqued herself You never plotted to win a husband I ll be bound pursued <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> and you have not the benefit of previous experience to aid you in discovering when others plot <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> felt this kind language where the benevolent speaker intended she should feel it in her very heart She could not even parry the shafts she was defenceless for the present To answer would have been to avow that the cap fitted <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> looking at her as she sat with troubled downcast eyes and cheek burning painfully and figure expressing in its bent attitude and unconscious tremor all the humiliation and chagrin she experienced felt the sufferer was fair game The strange woman had a natural antipathy to a shrinking sensitive character a nervous temperament nor was a pretty delicate and youthful face a passport to her affections It was seldom she met with all these obnoxious qualities combined in one individual still more seldom she found that individual at her mercy under circumstances in which she could crush her well She happened this afternoon to be specially bilious and morose as much disposed to gore as any vicious mother of the herd Lowering her large head she made a new charge Your cousin <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> is an excellent sister Miss Helstone Such ladies as come to try their life s luck here at Hollow s Cottage may by a very little clever female artifice cajole the mistress of the house and have the game all in their own hands You are fond of your cousin s society I dare say miss Of which cousin s Oh of the lady s _of course_ Hortense is and always has been most kind to me Every sister with an eligible single brother is considered most kind by her spinster friends <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> lifting her eyes slowly their blue orbs at the same time clearing from trouble and shining steady and full while the glow of shame left her cheek and its hue turned pale and settled <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> may I ask what you mean To give you a lesson on the cultivation of rectitude to disgust you with craft and false sentiment Do I need this lesson Most young ladies of the present day need it You are quite a modern young lady morbid delicate professing to like retirement which implies I suppose that you find little worthy of your sympathies in the ordinary world The ordinary world every day honest folks are better than you think them much better than any bookish romancing chit of a girl can be who hardly ever puts her nose over her uncle the parson s garden wall Consequently of whom you know nothing Excuse me indeed it does not matter whether you excuse me or not you have attacked me without provocation I shall defend myself without apology Of my relations with my two cousins you are ignorant In a fit of ill humour you have attempted to poison them by gratuitous insinuations which are far more crafty and false than anything with which you can justly charge me That I happen to be pale and sometimes to look diffident is no business of yours that I am fond of books and indisposed for common gossip is still less your business that I am a romancing chit of a girl is a mere conjecture on your part I never romanced to you nor to anybody you know That I am the parson s niece is not a crime though you may be narrow minded enough to think it so You dislike me You have no just reason for disliking me therefore keep the expression of your aversion to yourself If at any time in future you evince it annoyingly I shall answer even less scrupulously than I have done now She ceased and sat in white and still excitement She had spoken in the clearest of tones neither fast nor loud but her silver accents thrilled the ear The speed of the current in her veins was just then as swift as it was viewless <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> was not irritated at the reproof worded with a severity so simple dictated by a pride so quiet Turning coolly to Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> she said nodding her cap approvingly She has spirit in her after all Always speak as honestly as you have done just now she continued and you ll do I repel a recommendation so offensive was the answer delivered in the same pure key with the same clear look I reject counsel poisoned by insinuation It is my right to speak as I think proper nothing binds me to converse as you dictate So far from always speaking as I have done just now I shall never address any one in a tone so stern or in language so harsh unless in answer to unprovoked insult Mother you have found your match pronounced little <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> whom the scene appeared greatly to edify <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> had heard the whole with an unmoved face She now said No Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> is not my mother s match for she allows herself to be vexed My mother would wear her out in a few weeks <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> manages better Mother you have never hurt Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s feelings yet She wears armour under her silk dress that you cannot penetrate <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> often complained that her children were mutinous It was strange that with all her strictness with all her strong mindedness she could gain no command over them A look from their father had more influence with them than a lecture from her Miss <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to whom the position of witness to an altercation in which she took no part was highly displeasing as being an unimportant secondary post now rallying her dignity prepared to utter a discourse which was to prove both parties in the wrong and to make it clear to each disputant that she had reason to be ashamed of herself and ought to submit humbly to the superior sense of the individual then addressing her Fortunately for her audience she had not harangued above ten minutes when <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> s entrance with the tea tray called her attention first to the fact of that damsel having a gilt comb in her hair and a red necklace round her throat and secondly and subsequently to a pointed remonstrance to the duty of making tea After the meal <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> restored her to good humour by bringing her guitar and asking for a song and afterwards engaging her in an intelligent and sharp cross examination about guitar playing and music in general <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> meantime directed her assiduities to <PERSON>Caroline Sitting</PERSON> on a stool at her feet she talked to her first about religion and then about politics <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> was accustomed at home to drink in a great deal of what her father said on these subjects and afterwards in company to retail with more wit and fluency than consistency or discretion his opinions antipathies and preferences She rated <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> soundly for being a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Established Church</ORGANIZATION> and for having an uncle a clergyman She informed her that she lived on the country and ought to work for her living honestly instead of passing a useless life and eating the bread of idleness in the shape of tithes Thence <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> passed to a review of the ministry at that time in office and a consideration of its deserts She made familiar mention of the names of Lord <PERSON>Castlereagh</PERSON> and Mr Perceval Each of these personages she adorned with a character that might have separately suited Moloch and Belial She denounced the war as wholesale murder and Lord <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> as a hired butcher Her auditress listened with exceeding edification <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> had something of the genius of humour in her nature It was inexpressibly comic to hear her repeating her sire s denunciations in his nervous northern Doric as hearty a little Jacobin as ever pent a free mutinous spirit in a muslin frock and sash Not malignant by nature her language was not so bitter as it was racy and the expressive little face gave a piquancy to every phrase which held a beholder s interest captive Caroline chid her when she abused Lord <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> but she listened delighted to a subsequent tirade against the Prince <PERSON>Regent Jessie</PERSON> quickly read in the sparkle of her hearer s eye and the laughter hovering round her lips that at last she had hit on a topic that pleased Many a time had she heard the fat Adonis of fifty discussed at her father s breakfast table and she now gave Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s comments on the theme genuine as uttered by his <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> lips But <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> I will write about you no more This is an autumn evening wet and wild There is only one cloud in the sky but it curtains it from pole to pole The wind cannot rest it hurries sobbing over hills of sullen outline colourless with twilight and mist Rain has beat all day on that church tower It rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyard The nettles the long grass and the tombs all drip with wet This evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years ago a howling rainy autumn evening too when certain who had that day performed a pilgrimage to a grave new made in a heretic cemetery sat near a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling They were merry and social but they each knew that a gap never to be filled had been made in their circle They knew they had lost something whose absence could never be quite atoned for so long as they lived and they knew that heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which covered their lost darling and that the sad sighing gale was mourning above her buried head The fire warmed them life and friendship yet blessed them but <PERSON>Jessie</PERSON> lay cold coffined solitary only the sod screening her from the storm <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> folded up her knitting cut short the music lesson and the lecture on politics and concluded her visit to the cottage at an hour early enough to ensure her return to Briarmains before the blush of sunset should quite have faded in heaven or the path up the fields have become thoroughly moist with evening dew The lady and her daughters being gone <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> felt that she also ought to resume her scarf kiss her cousin s cheek and trip away homeward If she lingered much later dusk would draw on and <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> would be put to the trouble of coming to fetch her It was both baking and ironing day at the rectory she remembered <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> would be busy Still she could not quit her seat at the little parlour window From no point of view could the west look so lovely as from that lattice with the garland of jessamine round it whose white stars and green leaves seemed now but gray pencil outlines graceful in form but colourless in tint against the gold incarnadined of a summer evening against the fire tinged blue of an August sky at eight o clock p m <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> looked at the wicket gate beside which holly oaks spired up tall She looked at the close hedge of privet and laurel fencing in the garden her eyes longed to see something more than the shrubs before they turned from that limited prospect They longed to see a human figure of a certain mould and height pass the hedge and enter the gate A human figure she at last saw nay two <PERSON>Frederick Murgatroyd</PERSON> went by carrying a pail of water <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> followed dangling on his forefinger the keys of the mill They were going to lock up mill and stables for the night and then betake themselves home So must I thought <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> as she half rose and sighed This is all folly heart breaking folly she added In the first place though I should stay till dark there will be no arrival because I feel in my heart Fate has written it down in to day s page of her eternal book that I am not to have the pleasure I long for In the second place if he stepped in this moment my presence here would be a chagrin to him and the consciousness that it must be so would turn half my blood to ice His hand would perhaps be loose and chill if I put mine into it his eye would be clouded if I sought its beam I should look up for that kindling something I have seen in past days when my face or my language or my disposition had at some happy moment pleased him I should discover only darkness I had better go home She took her bonnet from the table where it lay and was just fastening the ribbon when <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> directing her attention to a splendid bouquet of flowers in a glass on the same table mentioned that Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> had sent them that morning from <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> and went on to comment on the guests that lady was at present entertaining on the bustling life she had lately been leading adding divers conjectures that she did not very well like it and much wonderment that a person who was so fond of her own way as the heiress did not find some means of sooner getting rid of this _cort ge_ of relatives But they say she actually will not let <PERSON>Mr Sympson</PERSON> and his family go she added They wanted much to return to the south last week to be ready for the reception of the only son who is expected home from a tour She insists that her cousin <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> shall come and join his friends here in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> I dare say she partly does it to oblige <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and myself How to oblige <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and you inquired <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> Why my child you are dull <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t you know you must often have heard Please ma am said <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> opening the door the preserves that you told me to boil in treacle the congfiters as you call them is all burnt to the pan Les confitures Elles sont br l es Ah quelle n gligence coupable Coquine de cuisini re fille insupportable And mademoiselle hastily taking from a drawer a large linen apron and tying it over her black apron rushed _ perdue_ into the kitchen whence to speak truth exhaled an odour of calcined sweets rather strong than savoury The mistress and maid had been in full feud the whole day on the subject of preserving certain black cherries hard as marbles sour as sloes <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> held that sugar was the only orthodox condiment to be used in that process mademoiselle maintained and proved it by the practice and experience of her mother grandmother and great grandmother that treacle m lasse was infinitely preferable She had committed an imprudence in leaving <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> in charge of the preserving pan for her want of sympathy in the nature of its contents had induced a degree of carelessness in watching their confection whereof the result was dark and cindery ruin Hubbub followed high upbraiding and sobs rather loud than deep or real <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> once more turning to the little mirror was shading her ringlets from her cheek to smooth them under her cottage bonnet certain that it would not only be useless but unpleasant to stay longer when on the sudden opening of the back door there fell an abrupt calm in the kitchen The tongues were checked pulled up as with bit and bridle Was it was it Robert He often almost always entered by the kitchen way on his return from market No it was only <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> who having hemmed significantly thrice every hem being meant as a lofty rebuke to the squabbling womankind said Now I thowt I heerd a crack None answered And he continued pragmatically as t maister s comed and as he ll enter through this hoyle I _con_sidered it desirable

succeeded a confused sort of pause which <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> though she was listening with both her ears could not understand It was very brief A cry broke it a sound of surprise followed by the sound of a kiss ejaculations but half articulate succeeded <ORGANIZATION>Mon Dieu mon Dieu Est</ORGANIZATION> ce que je m y attendais were the words chiefly to be distinguished Et tu te portes toujours bien bonne s ur inquired another voice <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s certainly <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was puzzled Obeying an impulse the wisdom of which she had not time to question she escaped from the little parlour by way of leaving the coast clear and running upstairs took up a position at the head of the banisters whence she could make further observations ere presenting herself It was considerably past sunset now dusk filled the passage yet not such deep dusk but that she could presently see <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> traverse it <PERSON>Caroline Caroline</PERSON> called <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> a moment afterwards venez voir mon fr re Strange commented Miss Helstone passing strange What does this unwonted excitement about such an every day occurrence as a return from market portend She has not lost her senses has she Surely the burnt treacle has not crazed her She descended in a subdued flutter Yet more was she fluttered when <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> seized her hand at the parlour door and leading her to <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> who stood in bodily presence tall and dark against the one window presented her with a mixture of agitation and formality as though they had been utter strangers and this was their first mutual introduction Increasing puzzle He bowed rather awkwardly and turning from her with a stranger s embarrassment he met the doubtful light from the window It fell on his face and the enigma of the dream a dream it seemed was at its height She saw a visage like and unlike <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and no <PERSON>Robert What</PERSON> is the matter said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> Is my sight wrong Is it my cousin Certainly it is your cousin asserted <PERSON>Hortense Then</PERSON> who was this now coming through the passage now entering the room <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> looking round met a new <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the real <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> as she felt at once Well said he smiling at her questioning astonished face which is which Ah this is _you_ was the answer He laughed I believe it is _me_ And do you know who _he_ is You never saw him before but you have heard of him She had gathered her senses now It _can_ be only one person your brother since it is so like you my other cousin <PERSON>Louis Clever</PERSON> little dipus you would have baffled the Sphinx But now see us together Change places change again to confuse her <PERSON>Louis Which</PERSON> is the old love now <PERSON>Lina</PERSON> As if it were possible to make a mistake when you speak You should have told <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> to ask But you are not so much alike It is only your height your figure and complexion that are so similar And I am <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> am I not asked the newcomer making a first effort to overcome what seemed his natural shyness <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> shook her head gently A soft expressive ray from her eye beamed on the real <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> It said much She was not permitted to quit her cousins soon <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself was peremptory in obliging her to remain Glad simple and affable in her demeanour glad for this night at least in light bright spirits for the time she was too pleasant an addition to the cottage circle to be willingly parted with by any of them <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> seemed naturally rather a grave still retiring man but the <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> of this evening which was not as you know reader the <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> of every day thawed his reserve and cheered his gravity soon He sat near her and talked to her She already knew his vocation was that of tuition She learned now he had for some years been the tutor of Mr <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> s son that he had been travelling with him and had accompanied him to the north She inquired if he liked his post but got a look in reply which did not invite or license further question The look woke <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s ready sympathy She thought it a very sad expression to pass over so sensible a face as <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> s for he _had_ a sensible face though not handsome she considered when seen near <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s She turned to make the comparison <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was leaning against the wall a little behind her turning over the leaves of a book of engravings and probably listening at the same time to the dialogue between her and <PERSON>Louis How</PERSON> could I think them alike she asked herself I see now it is <PERSON>Hortense Louis</PERSON> resembles not <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> And this was in part true He had the shorter nose and longer upper lip of his sister rather than the fine traits of his brother He had her mould of mouth and chin all less decisive accurate and clear than those of the young mill owner His air though deliberate and reflective could scarcely be called prompt and acute You felt in sitting near and looking up at him that a slower and probably a more benignant nature than that of the elder <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> shed calm on your impressions <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> perhaps aware that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s glance had wandered towards and dwelt upon him though he had neither met nor answered it put down the book of engravings and approaching took a seat at her side She resumed her conversation with <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> but while she talked to him her thoughts were elsewhere Her heart beat on the side from which her face was half averted She acknowledged a steady manly kindly air in <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION> but she bent before the secret power of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> To be so near him though he was silent though he did not touch so much as her scarf fringe or the white hem of her dress affected her like a spell Had she been obliged to speak to him _only_ it would have quelled but at liberty to address another it excited her Her discourse flowed freely it was gay playful eloquent The indulgent look and placid manner of her auditor encouraged her to ease the sober pleasure expressed by his smile drew out all that was brilliant in her nature She felt that this evening she appeared to advantage and as <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was a spectator the consciousness contented her Had he been called away collapse would at once have succeeded stimulus But her enjoyment was not long to shine full orbed a cloud soon crossed it <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> who for some time had been on the move ordering supper and was now clearing the little table of some books etc to make room for the tray called <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s attention to the glass of flowers the carmine and snow and gold of whose petals looked radiant indeed by candlelight They came from <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> she said intended as a gift to you no doubt We know who is the favourite there not I I m sure It was a wonder to hear <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> jest a sign that her spirits were at high water mark indeed We are to understand then that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is the favourite observed <PERSON>Louis Mon cher</PERSON> replied <PERSON>Hortense Robert</PERSON> c est tout ce qu il y a de plus pr cieux au monde c t de lui le reste du genre humain n est que du rebut N ai je pas raison mon enfant she added appealing to <PERSON>Caroline Caroline</PERSON> was obliged to reply Yes and her beacon was quenched Her star withdrew as she spoke Et toi <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> inquired Louis When you shall have an opportunity ask herself was the quiet answer Whether he reddened or paled <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> did not examine She discovered that it was late and she must go home Home she would go not even <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> could detain her now CHAPTER XXIV THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH The future sometimes seems to sob a low warning of the events it is bringing us like some gathering though yet remote storm which in tones of the wind in flushings of the firmament in clouds strangely torn announces a blast strong to strew the sea with wrecks or commissioned to bring in fog the yellow taint of pestilence covering white Western isles with the poisoned exhalations of the East dimming the lattices of English homes with the breath of Indian plague At other times this future bursts suddenly as if a rock had rent and in it a grave had opened whence issues the body of one that slept Ere you are aware you stand face to face with a shrouded and unthought of calamity a new <PERSON>Lazarus Caroline Helstone</PERSON> went home from Hollow s Cottage in good health as she imagined On waking the next morning she felt oppressed with unwonted languor At breakfast at each meal of the following day she missed all sense of appetite Palatable food was as ashes and sawdust to her Am I ill she asked and looked at herself in the glass Her eyes were bright their pupils dilated her cheeks seemed rosier and fuller than usual I look well why can I not eat She felt a pulse beat fast in her temples she felt too her brain in strange activity Her spirits were raised hundreds of busy and broken but brilliant thoughts engaged her mind A glow rested on them such as tinged her complexion Now followed a hot parched thirsty restless night Towards morning one terrible dream seized her like a tiger when she woke she felt and knew she was ill How she had caught the fever fever it was she could not tell Probably in her late walk home some sweet poisoned breeze redolent of honey dew and miasma had passed into her lungs and veins and finding there already a fever of mental excitement and a languor of long conflict and habitual sadness had fanned the spark to flame and left a well lit fire behind it It seemed however but a gentle fire After two hot days and worried nights there was no violence in the symptoms and neither her uncle nor <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> nor the doctor nor Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> when she called had any fear for her A few days would restore her every one believed The few days passed and though it was still thought it could not long delay the revival had not begun <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> who had visited her daily being present in her chamber one morning when she had been ill a fortnight watched her very narrowly for some minutes She took her hand and placed her finger on her wrist then quietly leaving the chamber she went to Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s study With him she remained closeted a long time half the morning On returning to her sick young friend she laid aside shawl and bonnet She stood awhile at the bedside one hand placed in the other gently rocking herself to and fro in an attitude and with a movement habitual to her At last she said I have sent <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> to fetch a few things for me such as I shall want during a short stay here It is my wish to remain with you till you are better Your uncle kindly permits my attendance Will it to yourself be acceptable <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I am sorry you should take such needless trouble I do not feel very ill but I cannot refuse resolutely It will be such comfort to know you are in the house to see you sometimes in the room but don t confine yourself on my account dear Mrs Pryor Fanny nurses me very well <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> bending over the pale little sufferer was now smoothing the hair under her cap and gently raising her pillow As she performed these offices <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> smiling lifted her face to kiss her Are you free from pain Are you tolerably at ease was inquired in a low earnest voice as the self elected nurse yielded to the caress I think I am almost happy You wish to drink Your lips are parched She held a glass filled with some cooling beverage to her mouth Have you eaten anything to day <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I cannot eat But soon your appetite will return it _must_ return that is I pray God it may In laying her again on the couch she encircled her in her arms and while so doing by a movement which seemed scarcely voluntary she drew her to her heart and held her close gathered an instant I shall hardly wish to get well that I may keep you always said <PERSON>Caroline Mrs Pryor</PERSON> did not smile at this speech Over her features ran a tremor which for some minutes she was absorbed in repressing You are more used to Fanny than to me she remarked ere long I should think my attendance must seem strange officious No quite natural and very soothing You must have been accustomed to wait on sick people ma am You move about the room so softly and you speak so quietly and touch me so gently I am dexterous in nothing my dear You will often find me awkward but never negligent Negligent indeed she was not From that hour <PERSON>Fanny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> became ciphers in the sick room Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> made it her domain she performed all its duties she lived in it day and night The patient remonstrated faintly however from the first and not at all ere long Loneliness and gloom were now banished from her bedside protection and solace sat there instead She and her nurse coalesced in wondrous union <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> was usually pained to require or receive much attendance Mrs Pryor under ordinary circumstances had neither the habit nor the art of performing little offices of service but all now passed with such ease so naturally that the patient was as willing to be cherished as the nurse was bent on cherishing no sign of weariness in the latter ever reminded the former that she ought to be anxious There was in fact no very hard duty to perform but a hireling might have found it hard With all this care it seemed strange the sick girl did not get well yet such was the case She wasted like any snow wreath in thaw she faded like any flower in drought Miss Keeldar on whose thoughts danger or death seldom intruded had at first entertained no fears at all for her friend but seeing her change and sink from time to time when she paid her visits alarm clutched her heart She went to Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and expressed herself with so much energy that that gentleman was at last obliged however unwillingly to admit the idea that his niece was ill of something more than a migraine and when <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> came and quietly demanded a physician he said she might send for two if she liked One came but that one was an oracle He delivered a dark saying of which the future was to solve the mystery wrote some prescriptions gave some directions the whole with an air of crushing authority pocketed his fee and went Probably he knew well enough he could do no good but didn t like to say so Still no rumour of serious illness got wind in the neighbourhood At Hollow s Cottage it was thought that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had only a severe cold she having written a note to <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> to that effect and mademoiselle contented herself with sending two pots of currant jam a recipe for a tisane and a note of advice <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> being told that a physician had been summoned sneered at the hypochondriac fancies of the rich and idle who she said having nothing but themselves to think about must needs send for a doctor if only so much as their little finger ached The rich and idle represented in the person of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> were meantime falling fast into a condition of prostration whose quickly consummated debility puzzled all who witnessed it except one for that one alone reflected how liable is the undermined structure to sink in sudden ruin Sick people often have fancies inscrutable to ordinary attendants and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had one which even her tender nurse could not at first explain On a certain day in the week at a certain hour she would whether worse or better entreat to be taken up and dressed and suffered to sit in her chair near the window This station she would retain till noon was past Whatever degree of exhaustion or debility her wan aspect betrayed she still softly put off all persuasion to seek repose until the church clock had duly tolled midday The twelve strokes sounded she grew docile and would meekly lie down Returned to the couch she usually buried her face deep in the pillow and drew the coverlets close round her as if to shut out the world and sun of which she was tired More than once as she thus lay a slight convulsion shook the sick bed and a faint sob broke the silence round it These things were not unnoted by Mrs Pryor One Tuesday morning as usual she had asked leave to rise and now she sat wrapped in her white dressing gown leaning forward in the easy chair gazing steadily and patiently from the lattice <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> was seated a little behind knitting as it seemed but in truth watching her A change crossed her pale mournful brow animating its languor a light shot into her faded eyes reviving their lustre she half rose and looked earnestly out Mrs Pryor drawing softly near glanced over her shoulder From this window was visible the churchyard beyond it the road and there riding sharply by appeared a horseman The figure was not yet too remote for recognition <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> had long sight she knew Mr <PERSON>Moore Just</PERSON> as an intercepting rising ground concealed him from view the clock struck twelve May I lie down again asked <PERSON>Caroline Her</PERSON> nurse assisted her to bed Having laid her down and drawn the curtain she stood listening near The little couch trembled the suppressed sob stirred the air A contraction as of anguish altered <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> s features she wrung her hands half a groan escaped her lips She now remembered that Tuesday was Whinbury market day Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> must always pass the rectory on his way thither just ere noon of that day <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> wore continually round her neck a slender braid of silk attached to which was some trinket Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> had seen the bit of gold glisten but had not yet obtained a fair view of it Her patient never parted with it When dressed it was hidden in her bosom as she lay in bed she always held it in her hand That Tuesday afternoon the transient doze more like lethargy than sleep which sometimes abridged the long days had stolen over her The weather was hot While turning in febrile restlessness she had pushed the coverlets a little aside <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> bent to replace them The small wasted hand lying nerveless on the sick girl s breast clasped as usual her jealously guarded treasure Those fingers whose attenuation it gave pain to see were now relaxed in sleep <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> gently disengaged the braid drawing out a tiny locket a slight thing it was such as it suited her small purse to purchase Under its crystal face appeared a curl of black hair too short and crisp to have been severed from a female head Some agitated movement occasioned a twitch of the silken chain The sleeper started and woke Her thoughts were usually now somewhat scattered on waking her look generally wandering Half rising as if in terror she exclaimed <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t take it from me <PERSON>Robert Don</PERSON> t It is my last comfort let me keep it I never tell any one whose hair it is I never show it Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> had already disappeared behind the curtain Reclining far back in a deep arm chair by the bedside she was withdrawn from view <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> looked abroad into the chamber she thought it empty As her stray ideas returned slowly each folding its weak wings on the mind s sad shore like birds exhausted beholding void and perceiving silence round her she believed herself alone Collected she was not yet perhaps healthy self possession and self control were to be hers no more perhaps that world the strong and prosperous live in had already rolled from beneath her feet for ever So at least it often seemed to herself In health she had never been accustomed to think aloud but now words escaped her lips unawares Oh I _should_ see him once more before all is over Heaven _might_ favour me thus far she cried God grant me a little comfort before I die was her humble petition But he will not know I am ill till I am gone and he will come when they have laid me out and I am senseless cold and stiff What can my departed soul feel then Can it see or know what happens to the clay Can spirits through any medium communicate with living flesh Can the dead at all revisit those they leave Can they come in the elements Will wind water fire lend me a path to <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Is it for nothing the wind sounds almost articulately sometimes sings as I have lately heard it sing at night or passes the casement sobbing as if for sorrow to come Does nothing then haunt it nothing inspire it Why it suggested to me words one night it poured a strain which I could have written down only I was appalled and dared not rise to seek pencil and paper by the dim watch light What is that electricity they speak of whose changes make us well or ill whose lack or excess blasts whose even balance revives What are all those influences that are about us in the atmosphere that keep playing over our nerves like fingers on stringed instruments and call forth now a sweet note and now a wail now an exultant swell and anon the saddest cadence _Where is_ the other world In _what_ will another life consist Why do I ask Have I not cause to think that the hour is hasting but too fast when the veil must be rent for me Do I not know the Grand Mystery is likely to burst prematurely on me Great Spirit in whose goodness I confide whom as my Father I have petitioned night and morning from early infancy help the weak creation of Thy hands Sustain me through the ordeal I dread and must undergo Give me strength Give me patience Give me oh _give me_ FAITH She fell back on her pillow Mrs Pryor found means to steal quietly from the room She re entered it soon after apparently as composed as if she had really not overheard this strange soliloquy The next day several callers came It had become known that Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> was worse Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and his sister <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> arrived Both after they had been in the sickroom quitted it in tears they had found the patient more altered than they expected <PERSON>Hortense Moore</PERSON> came <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> seemed stimulated by her presence She assured her smiling she was not dangerously ill she talked to her in a low voice but cheerfully During her stay excitement kept up the flush of her complexion she looked better How is Mr <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> as <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> was preparing to take leave He was very well when he left Left Is he gone from home It was then explained that some police intelligence about the rioters of whom he was in pursuit had that morning called him away to <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> and probably a fortnight might elapse ere he returned He is not aware that Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> is very ill Oh no He thought like me that she had only a bad cold After this visit <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> took care not to approach <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s couch for above an hour She heard her weep and dared not look on her tears As evening closed in she brought her some tea <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> opening her eyes from a moment s slumber viewed her nurse with an unrecognizing glance I smelt the honeysuckles in the glen this summer morning she said as I stood at the counting house window Strange words like these from pallid lips pierce a loving listener s heart more poignantly than steel They sound romantic perhaps in books in real life they are harrowing My darling do you know me said <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> I went in to call <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> to breakfast I have been with him in the garden He asked me to go A heavy dew has refreshed the flowers The peaches are ripening My darling my darling again and again repeated the nurse I thought it was daylight long after sunrise It looks dark Is the moon now set That moon lately risen was gazing full and mild upon her Floating in deep blue space it watched her unclouded Then it is not morning I am not at the cottage Who is this I see a shape at my bedside It is myself it is your friend your nurse your Lean your head on my shoulder Collect yourself In a lower tone O God take pity Give _her_ life and _me_ strength Send me courage Teach me words Some minutes passed in silence The patient lay mute and passive in the trembling arms on the throbbing bosom of the nurse I am better now whispered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> at last much better I feel where I am This is Mrs Pryor near me I was dreaming I talk when I wake up from dreams people often do in illness How fast your heart beats ma am Do not be afraid It is not fear child only a little anxiety which will pass I have brought you some tea Cary Your uncle made it himself You know he says he can make a better cup of tea than any housewife can Taste it He is concerned to hear that you eat so little he would be glad if you had a better appetite I am thirsty Let me drink She drank eagerly What o clock is it ma am she asked Past nine Not later Oh I have yet a long night before me But the tea has made me strong I will sit up <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> raised her and arranged her pillows Thank Heaven I am not always equally miserable and ill and hopeless The afternoon has been bad since <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> went perhaps the evening may be better It is a fine night I think The moon shines clear Very fine a perfect summer night The old church tower gleams white almost as silver And does the churchyard look peaceful Yes and the garden also Dew glistens on the foliage Can you see many long weeds and nettles amongst the graves or do they look turfy and flowery I see closed daisy heads gleaming like pearls on some mounds <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> has mown down the dock leaves and rank grass and cleared all away I always like that to be done it soothes one s mind to see the place in order And I dare say within the church just now that moonlight shines as softly as in my room It will fall through the east window full on the <LOCATION>Helstone</LOCATION> monument When I close my eyes I seem to see poor papa s epitaph in black letters on the white marble There is plenty of room for other inscriptions underneath <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> came to look after your flowers this morning He was afraid now you cannot tend them yourself they would be neglected He has taken two of your favourite plants home to nurse for you If I were to make a will I would leave <PERSON>William</PERSON> all my plants <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> my trinkets except one which must not be taken off my neck and you ma am my books After a pause Mrs Pryor I feel a longing wish for something For what <PERSON>Caroline You</PERSON> know I always delight to hear you sing Sing me a hymn just now Sing that hymn which begins Our God our help in ages past Our hope for years to come Our shelter from the stormy blast Our refuge haven home Mrs Pryor at once complied No wonder <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> liked to hear her sing Her voice even in speaking was sweet and silver clear in song it was almost divine Neither flute nor dulcimer has tones so pure But the tone was secondary compared to the expression which trembled through a tender vibration from a feeling heart The servants in the kitchen hearing the strain stole to the stair foot to listen Even old <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> as he walked in the garden pondering over the unaccountable and feeble nature of women stood still amongst his borders to catch the mournful melody more distinctly Why it reminded him of his forgotten dead wife he could not tell nor why it made him more concerned than he had hitherto been for <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s fading girlhood He was glad to recollect that he had promised to pay <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> the magistrate a visit that evening Low spirits and gloomy thoughts were very much his aversion When they attacked him he usually found means to make them march in double quick time The hymn followed him faintly as he crossed the fields He hastened his customary sharp pace that he might get beyond its reach Thy word commands our flesh to dust Return ye sons of men All nations rose from earth at first And turn to earth again A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun Time like an ever rolling stream Bears all its sons away They fly forgotten as a dream Dies at the opening day Like flowery fields the nations stand Fresh in the morning light The flowers beneath the mower s hand Lie withering ere tis night Our God our help in ages past Our hope for years to come Be Thou our guard while troubles last O Father be our home Now sing a song a Scottish song suggested <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when the hymn was over <PERSON>Ye</PERSON> banks and braes o bonnie Doon Again <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> obeyed or essayed to obey At the close of the first stanza she stopped She could get no further Her full heart flowed over You are weeping at the pathos of the air Come here and I will comfort you said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in a pitying accent Mrs Pryor came She sat down on the edge of her patient s bed and allowed the wasted arms to encircle her You often soothe me let me soothe you murmured the young girl kissing her cheek I hope she added it is not for me you weep No answer followed Do you think I shall not get better I do not feel _very_ ill only weak But your mind <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> your mind is crushed Your heart is almost broken you have been so neglected so repulsed left so desolate I believe grief is and always has been my worst ailment I sometimes think if an abundant gush of happiness came on me I could revive yet Do you wish to live I have no object in life You love me <PERSON>Caroline Very</PERSON> much very truly inexpressibly sometimes Just now I feel as if I could almost grow to your heart I will return directly dear remarked <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> as she laid <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> down Quitting her she glided to the door softly turned the key in the lock ascertained that it was fast and came back She bent over her She threw back the curtain to admit the moonlight more freely She gazed intently on her face Then if you love me said she speaking quickly with an altered voice if you feel as if to use your own words you could grow to my heart it will be neither shock nor pain for you to know that _that_ heart is the source whence yours was filled that from _my_ veins issued the tide which flows in _yours_ that you are _mine_ my daughter my own child <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> My own child That is that means you have adopted me It means that if I have given you nothing else I at least gave you life that I bore you nursed you that I am your true mother No other woman can claim the title it is _mine_ But <PERSON>Mrs James Helstone</PERSON> but my father s wife whom I do not remember ever to have seen she is my mother She _is_ your mother <PERSON>James Helstone</PERSON> was _my_ husband I say you are _mine_ I have proved it I thought perhaps you were all his which would have been a cruel dispensation for me I find it is _not_ so God permitted me to be the parent of my child s mind It belongs to me it is my property my _right_ These features are <PERSON>James</PERSON> s own He had a fine face when he was young and not altered by error Papa my darling gave you your blue eyes and soft brown hair he gave you the oval of your face and the regularity of your lineaments the outside _he_ conferred but the heart and the brain are _mine_ The germs are from _me_ and they are improved they are developed to excellence I esteem and approve my child as highly as I do most fondly love her Is what I hear true Is it no dream I wish it were as true that the substance and colour of health were restored to your cheek My own mother is she one I can be so fond of as I can of you People generally did not like her so I have been given to understand They told you that Well your mother now tells you that not having the gift to please people generally for their approbation she does not care Her thoughts are centred in her child Does that child welcome or reject her But if you _are_ my mother the world is all changed to me Surely I can live I should like to recover You _must_ recover You drew life and strength from my breast when you were a tiny fair infant over whose blue eyes I used to weep fearing I beheld in your very beauty the sign of qualities that had entered my heart like iron and pierced through my soul like a sword Daughter we have been long parted I return now to cherish you again She held her to her bosom she cradled her in her arms she rocked her softly as if lulling a young child to sleep My mother my own mother The offspring nestled to the parent that parent feeling the endearment and hearing the appeal gathered her closer still She covered her with noiseless kisses she murmured love over her like a cushat fostering its young There was silence in the room for a long while Does my uncle know Your uncle knows I told him when I first came to stay with you here Did you recognize me when we first met at Fieldhead How could it be otherwise Mr and Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> being announced I was prepared to see my child It was that then which moved you I saw you disturbed You saw nothing <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I can cover my feelings You can never tell what an age of strange sensation I lived during the two minutes that elapsed between the report of your name and your entrance You can never tell how your look mien carriage shook me Why Were you disappointed What will she be like I had asked myself and when I saw what you were like I could have dropped <PERSON>Mamma</PERSON> why I trembled in your presence I said I will never own her she shall never know me But I said and did nothing remarkable I felt a little diffident at the thought of an introduction to strangers that was all I soon saw you were diffident That was the first thing which reassured me Had you been rustic clownish awkward I should have been content You puzzle me I had reason to dread a fair outside to mistrust a popular bearing to shudder before distinction grace and courtesy Beauty and affability had come in my way when I was recluse desolate young and ignorant a toil worn governess perishing of uncheered labour breaking down before her time These <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when they smiled on me I mistook for angels I followed them home and when into their hands I had given without reserve my whole chance of future happiness it was my lot to witness a transfiguration on the domestic hearth to see the white mask lifted the bright disguise put away and opposite me sat down O God I _have_ suffered She sank on the pillow I _have_ suffered None saw none knew There was no sympathy no redemption no redress Take comfort mother It is over now It is over and not fruitlessly I tried to keep the word of His patience He kept me in the days of my anguish I was afraid with terror I was troubled Through great tribulation He brought me through to a salvation revealed in this last time My fear had torment He has cast it out He has given me in its stead perfect love But <PERSON>Caroline Thus</PERSON> she invoked her daughter after a pause Mother I charge you when you next look on your father s monument to respect the name chiselled there To you he did only good On you he conferred his whole treasure of beauties nor added to them one dark defect All _you_ derived from him is excellent You owe him gratitude Leave between him and me the settlement of our mutual account Meddle not God is the arbiter This world s laws never came near us never They were powerless as a rotten bulrush to protect me impotent as idiot babblings to restrain him As you said it is all over now the grave lies between us There he sleeps in that church To his dust I say this night what I have never said before <PERSON>James</PERSON> slumber peacefully See your terrible debt is cancelled Look I wipe out the long black account with my own hand <PERSON>James</PERSON> your child atones This living likeness of you this thing with your perfect features this one good gift you gave me has nestled affectionately to my heart and tenderly called me mother <PERSON>Husband</PERSON> rest forgiven Dearest mother that is right Can papa s spirit hear us Is he comforted to know that we still love him I said nothing of love I spoke of forgiveness Mind the truth child I said nothing of love On the threshold of eternity should he be there to see me enter will I maintain that O mother you must have suffered O child the human heart _can_ suffer It can hold more tears than the ocean holds waters We never know how deep how wide it is till misery begins to unbind her clouds and fill it with rushing blackness Mother forget Forget she said with the strangest spectre of a laugh The north pole will rush to the south and the headlands of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> be locked into the bays of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> ere I forget Hush mother Rest Be at peace And the child lulled the parent as the parent had erst lulled the child At last Mrs Pryor wept She then grew calmer She resumed those tender cares agitation had for a moment suspended Replacing her daughter on the couch she smoothed the pillow and spread the sheet The soft hair whose locks were loosened she rearranged the damp brow she refreshed with a cool fragrant essence Mamma let them bring a candle that I may see you and tell my uncle to come into this room by and by I want to hear him say that I am your daughter And mamma take your supper here <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t leave me for one minute to night O Caroline it is well you are gentle You will say to me Go and I shall go Come and I shall come Do this and I shall do it You inherit a certain manner as well as certain features It will always be mamma prefacing a mandate softly spoken though from you thank God Well she added under her breath he spoke softly too once like a flute breathing tenderness and then when the world was not by to listen discords that split the nerves and curdled the blood sounds to inspire insanity It seems so natural mamma to ask you for this and that I shall want nobody but you to be near me or to do anything for me But do not let me be troublesome Check me if I encroach You must not depend on me to check you you must keep guard over yourself I have little moral courage the want of it is my bane It is that which has made me an unnatural parent which has kept me apart from my child during the ten years which have elapsed since my husband s death left me at liberty to claim her It was that which first unnerved my arms and permitted the infant I might have retained a while longer to be snatched prematurely from their embrace How mamma I let you go as a babe because you were pretty and I feared your loveliness deeming it the stamp of perversity They sent me your portrait taken at eight years old that portrait confirmed my fears Had it shown me a sunburnt little rustic a heavy blunt featured commonplace child I should have hastened to claim you but there under the silver paper I saw blooming the delicacy of an aristocratic flower little lady was written on every trait I had too recently crawled from under the yoke of the fine gentleman escaped galled crushed paralyzed dying to dare to encounter his still finer and most fairy like representative My sweet little lady overwhelmed me with dismay her air of native elegance froze my very marrow In my experience I had not met with truth modesty good principle as the concomitants of beauty A form so straight and fine I argued must conceal a mind warped and cruel I had little faith in the power of education to rectify such a mind or rather I entirely misdoubted my own ability to influence it <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I dared not undertake to rear you I resolved to leave you in your uncle s hands <PERSON>Matthewson Helstone</PERSON> I knew if an austere was an upright man He and all the world thought hardly of me for my strange unmotherly resolve and I deserved to be misjudged <PERSON>Mamma</PERSON> why did you call yourself <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> It was a name in my mother s family I adopted it that I might live unmolested My married name recalled too vividly my married life I could not bear it Besides threats were uttered of forcing me to return to bondage It could not be Rather a bier for a bed the grave for a home My new name sheltered me I resumed under its screen my old occupation of teaching At first it scarcely procured me the means of sustaining life but how savoury was hunger when I fasted in peace How safe seemed the darkness and chill of an unkindled hearth when no lurid reflection from terror crimsoned its desolation How serene was solitude when I feared not the irruption of violence and vice But mamma you have been in this neighbourhood before How did it happen that when you reappeared here with Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> you were not recognized I only paid a short visit as a bride twenty years ago and then I was very different to what I am now slender almost as slender as my daughter is at this day My complexion my very features are changed my hair my style of dress everything is altered You cannot fancy me a slim young person attired in scanty drapery of white muslin with bare arms bracelets and necklace of beads and hair disposed in round Grecian curls above my forehead You must indeed have been different Mamma I heard the front door open If it is my uncle coming in just ask him to step upstairs and let me hear his assurance that I am truly awake and collected and not dreaming or delirious The rector of his own accord was mounting the stairs and <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> summoned him to his niece s apartment She s not worse I hope he inquired hastily I think her better She is disposed to converse she seems stronger <PERSON>Good</PERSON> said he brushing quickly into the room <PERSON>Ha Cary</PERSON> how do Did you drink my cup of tea I made it for you just as I like it myself I drank it every drop uncle It did me good it has made me quite alive I have a wish for company so I begged <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> to call you in The respected ecclesiastic looked pleased and yet embarrassed He was willing enough to bestow his company on his sick niece for ten minutes since it was her whim to wish it but what means to employ for her entertainment he knew not He hemmed he fidgeted You ll be up in a trice he observed by way of saying something The little weakness will soon pass off and then you must drink port wine a pipe if you can and eat game and oysters I ll get them for you if they are to be had anywhere Bless me we ll make you as strong as <PERSON>Samson</PERSON> before we re done with you Who is that lady uncle standing beside you at the bed foot Good God he ejaculated She s not wandering is she ma am <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> smiled I am wandering in a pleasant world said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in a soft happy voice and I want you to tell me whether it is real or visionary What lady is that Give her a name uncle We must have Dr Rile again ma am or better still MacTurk He s less of a humbug <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> must saddle the pony and go for him No I don t want a doctor Mamma shall be my only physician Now do you understand uncle <PERSON>Mr Helstone</PERSON> pushed up his spectacles from his nose to his forehead handled his snuff box and administered to himself a portion of the contents Thus fortified he answered briefly I see daylight You ve told her then ma am And is it _true_ demanded <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> rising on her pillow Is she _really_ my mother You won t cry or make any scene or turn hysterical if I answer Yes Cry I d cry if you said _No_ It would be terrible to be disappointed now But give her a name How do you call her I call this stout lady in a quaint black dress who looks young enough to wear much smarter raiment if she would I call her <PERSON>Agnes Helstone She</PERSON> married my brother <PERSON>James</PERSON> and is his widow And my mother What a little sceptic it is Look at her small face Mrs Pryor scarcely larger than the palm of my hand alive with acuteness and eagerness To <PERSON>Caroline She</PERSON> had the trouble of bringing you into the world at any rate Mind you show your duty to her by quickly getting well and repairing the waste of these cheeks <PERSON>Heigh</PERSON> ho she used to be plump What she has done with it all I can t for the life of me divine If _wishing_ to get well will help me I shall not be long sick This morning I had no reason and no strength to wish it Fanny here tapped at the door and said that supper was ready Uncle if you please you may send me a little bit of supper anything you like from your own plate That is wiser than going into hysterics is it not It is spoken like a sage Cary See if I don t cater for you judiciously When women are sensible and above all intelligible I can get on with them It is only the vague superfine sensations and extremely wire drawn notions that put me about Let a woman ask me to give her an edible or a wearable be the same a roc s egg or the breastplate of <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> a share of St John s locusts and honey or the leathern girdle about his loins I can at least understand the demand but when they pine for they know not what sympathy sentiment some of these indefinite abstractions I can t do it I don t know it I haven t got it Madam accept my arm <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> signified that she should stay with her daughter that evening <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> accordingly left them together He soon returned bringing a plate in his own consecrated hand This is chicken he said but we ll have partridge to morrow Lift her up and put a shawl over her On my word I understand nursing Now here is the very same little silver fork you used when you first came to the rectory That strikes me as being what you may call a happy thought a delicate attention Take it <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> and munch away cleverly <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> did her best Her uncle frowned to see that her powers were so limited He prophesied however great things for the future and as she praised the morsel he had brought and smiled gratefully in his face he stooped over her pillow kissed her and said with a broken rugged accent Good night bairnie God bless thee <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> enjoyed such peaceful rest that night circled by her mother s arms and pillowed on her breast that she forgot to wish for any other stay and though more than one feverish dream came to her in slumber yet when she woke up panting so happy and contented a feeling returned with returning consciousness that her agitation was soothed almost as soon as felt As to the mother she spent the night like <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Peniel Till</LOCATION> break of day she wrestled with God in earnest prayer CHAPTER XXV THE WEST WIND BLOWS Not always do those who dare such divine conflict prevail Night after night the sweat of agony may burst dark on the forehead the supplicant may cry for mercy with that soundless voice the soul utters when its appeal is to the Invisible Spare my beloved it may implore Heal my life s life Rend not from me what long affection entwines with my whole nature God of heaven bend hear be clement And after this cry and strife the sun may rise and see him worsted That opening morn which used to salute him with the whisper of zephyrs the carol of skylarks may breathe as its first accents from the dear lips which colour and heat have quitted Oh I have had a suffering night This morning I am worse I have tried to rise I cannot Dreams I am unused to have troubled me Then the watcher approaches the patient s pillow and sees a new and strange moulding of the familiar features feels at once that the insufferable moment draws nigh knows that it is God s will his idol shall be broken and bends his head and subdues his soul to the sentence he cannot avert and scarce can bear Happy Mrs Pryor She was still praying unconscious that the summer sun hung above the hills when her child softly woke in her arms No piteous unconscious moaning sound which so wastes our strength that even if we have sworn to be firm a rush of unconquerable tears sweeps away the oath preceded her waking No space of deaf apathy followed The first words spoken were not those of one becoming estranged from this world and already permitted to stray at times into realms foreign to the living <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> evidently remembered with clearness what had happened Mamma I have slept _so_ well I only dreamed and woke twice Mrs Pryor rose with a start that her daughter might not see the joyful tears called into her eyes by that affectionate word mamma and the welcome assurance that followed it For many days the mother dared rejoice only with trembling That first revival seemed like the flicker of a dying lamp If the flame streamed up bright one moment the next it sank dim in the socket Exhaustion followed close on excitement There was always a touching endeavour to _appear_ better but too often ability refused to second will too often the attempt to bear up failed The effort to eat to talk to look cheerful was unsuccessful Many an hour passed during which <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> feared that the chords of life could never more be strengthened though the time of their breaking might be deferred During this space the mother and daughter seemed left almost alone in the neighbourhood It was the close of August the weather was fine that is to say it was very dry and very dusty for an arid wind had been blowing from the east this month past very cloudless too though a pale haze stationary in the atmosphere seemed to rob of all depth of tone the blue of heaven of all freshness the verdure of earth and of all glow the light of day Almost every family in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> was absent on an excursion Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and her friends were at the seaside so were Mrs <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s household Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> between whom a spontaneous intimacy seemed to have arisen the result probably of harmony of views and temperament were gone up north on a pedestrian excursion to the Lakes Even <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> who would fain have stayed at home and aided Mrs Pryor in nursing <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had been so earnestly entreated by Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> to accompany her once more to <LOCATION>Wormwood Wells</LOCATION> in the hope of alleviating sufferings greatly aggravated by the insalubrious weather that she felt obliged to comply indeed it was not in her nature to refuse a request that at once appealed to her goodness of heart and by a confession of dependency flattered her _amour propre_ As for <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> he had gone on to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> where he still sojourned So long as the breath of Asiatic deserts parched <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s lips and fevered her veins her physical convalescence could not keep pace with her returning mental tranquillity but there came a day when the wind ceased to sob at the eastern gable of the rectory and at the oriel window of the church A little cloud like a man s hand arose in the west gusts from the same quarter drove it on and spread it wide wet and tempest prevailed a while When that was over the sun broke out genially heaven regained its azure and earth its green the livid cholera tint had vanished from the face of nature the hills rose clear round the horizon absolved from that pale malaria haze <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s youth could now be of some avail to her and so could her mother s nurture Both crowned by God s blessing sent in the pure west wind blowing soft as fresh through the ever open chamber lattice rekindled her long languishing energies At last Mrs <PERSON>Pryor</PERSON> saw that it was permitted to hope a genuine material convalescence had commenced It was not merely <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s smile which was brighter or her spirits which were cheered but a certain look had passed from her face and eye a look dread and indescribable but which will easily be recalled by those who have watched the couch of dangerous disease Long before the emaciated outlines of her aspect began to fill or its departed colour to return a more subtle change took place all grew softer and warmer Instead of a marble mask and glassy eye <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> saw laid on the pillow a face pale and wasted enough perhaps more haggard than the other appearance but less awful for it was a sick living girl not a mere white mould or rigid piece of statuary Now too she was not always petitioning to drink The words I am _so_ thirsty ceased to be her plaint Sometimes when she had swallowed a morsel she would say it had revived her All descriptions of food were no longer equally distasteful she could be induced sometimes to indicate a preference With what trembling pleasure and anxious care did not her nurse prepare what was selected How she watched her as she partook of it Nourishment brought strength She could sit up Then she longed to breathe the fresh air to revisit her flowers to see how the fruit had ripened Her uncle always liberal had bought a garden chair for her express use He carried her down in his own arms and placed her in it himself and <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> was there to wheel her round the walks to show her what he had done amongst her plants to take her directions for further work <PERSON>William</PERSON> and she found plenty to talk about They had a dozen topics in common interesting to them unimportant to the rest of the world They took a similar interest in animals birds insects and plants they held similar doctrines about humanity to the lower creation and had a similar turn for minute observation on points of natural history The nest and proceedings of some ground bees which had burrowed in the turf under an old cherry tree was one subject of interest the haunts of certain hedge sparrows and the welfare of certain pearly eggs and callow fledglings another Had _<ORGANIZATION>Chambers s Journal</ORGANIZATION>_ existed in those days it would certainly have formed Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s and <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> s favourite periodical She would have subscribed for it and to him each number would duly have been lent both would have put implicit faith and found great savour in its marvellous anecdotes of animal sagacity This is a digression but it suffices to explain why <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> would have no other hand than <PERSON>William</PERSON> s to guide her chair and why his society and conversation sufficed to give interest to her garden airings Mrs Pryor walking near wondered how her daughter could be so much at ease with a man of the people _She_ found it impossible to speak to him otherwise than stiffly She felt as if a great gulf lay between her caste and his and that to cross it or meet him half way would be to degrade herself She gently asked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> Are you not afraid my dear to converse with that person so unreservedly He may presume and become troublesomely garrulous <PERSON>William</PERSON> presume mamma You don t know him He never presumes He is altogether too proud and sensitive to do so <PERSON>William</PERSON> has very fine feelings And <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> smiled sceptically at the na ve notion of that rough handed rough headed fustian clad clown having fine feelings <PERSON>Farren</PERSON> for his part showed <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> only a very sulky brow He knew when he was misjudged and was apt to turn unmanageable with such as failed to give him his due The evening restored <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> entirely to her mother and <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> liked the evening for then alone with her daughter no human shadow came between her and what she loved During the day she would have her stiff demeanour and cool moments as was her wont Between her and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> a very respectful but most rigidly ceremonious intercourse was kept up Anything like familiarity would have bred contempt at once in one or both these personages but by dint of strict civility and well maintained distance they got on very smoothly Towards the servants <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> s bearing was not uncourteous but shy freezing ungenial Perhaps it was diffidence rather than pride which made her appear so haughty but as was to be expected <ORGANIZATION>Fanny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> failed to make the distinction and she was unpopular with them accordingly She felt the effect produced it rendered her at times dissatisfied with herself for faults she could not help and with all else dejected chill and taciturn This mood changed to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s influence and to that influence alone The dependent fondness of her nursling the natural affection of her child came over her suavely Her frost fell away her rigidity unbent she grew smiling and pliant Not that <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> made any wordy profession of love that would ill have suited <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> she would have read therein the proof of insincerity but she hung on her with easy dependence she confided in her with fearless reliance These things contented the mother s heart She liked to hear her daughter say <PERSON>Mamma</PERSON> do this Please mamma fetch me that <PERSON>Mamma</PERSON> read to me Sing a little mamma Nobody else not one living thing had ever so claimed her services so looked for help at her hand Other people were always more or less reserved and stiff with her as she was reserved and stiff with them other people betrayed consciousness of and annoyance at her weak points <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> no more showed such wounding sagacity or reproachful sensitiveness now than she had done when a suckling of three months old Yet <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> could find fault <PERSON>Blind</PERSON> to the constitutional defects that were incurable she had her eyes wide open to the acquired habits that were susceptible of remedy On certain points she would quite artlessly lecture her parent and that parent instead of being hurt felt a sensation of pleasure in discovering that the girl _dared_ lecture her that she was so much at home with her Mamma I am determined you shall not wear that old gown any more Its fashion is not becoming it is too strait in the skirt You shall put on your black silk every afternoon In that you look nice it suits you And you shall have a black satin dress for Sundays a real satin not a satinet or any of the shams And mamma when you get the new one mind you must wear it My dear I thought of the black silk serving me as a best dress for many years yet and I wished to buy you several things Nonsense mamma My uncle gives me cash to get what I want You know he is generous enough and I have set my heart on seeing you in a black satin Get it soon and let it be made by a dressmaker of my recommending Let me choose the pattern You always want to disguise yourself like a grandmother You would persuade one that you are old and ugly Not at all On the contrary when well dressed and cheerful you are very comely indeed your smile is so pleasant your teeth are so white your hair is still such a pretty light colour And then you speak like a young lady with such a clear fine tone and you sing better than any young lady I ever heard Why do you wear such dresses and bonnets mamma such as nobody else ever wears Does it annoy you Caroline Very much it vexes me even People say you are miserly and yet you are not for you give liberally to the poor and to religious societies though your gifts are conveyed so secretly and quietly that they are known to few except the receivers But I will be your lady s maid myself When I get a little stronger I will set to work and you must be good mamma and do as I bid you And <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> sitting near her mother rearranged her muslin handkerchief and resmoothed her hair My own mamma then she went on as if pleasing herself with the thought of their relationship who belongs to me and to whom I belong I am a rich girl now I have something I can love well and not be afraid of loving Mamma who gave you this little brooch Let me unpin it and look at it <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> who usually shrank from meddling fingers and near approach allowed the license complacently Did papa give you this mamma My sister gave it me my only sister <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> Would that your Aunt <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> had lived to see her niece Have you nothing of papa s no trinket no gift of his I have one thing That you prize That I prize Valuable and pretty Invaluable and sweet to me Show it mamma Is it here or at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> It is talking to me now leaning on me Its arms are round me Ah mamma you mean your teasing daughter who will never let you alone who when you go into your room cannot help running to seek for you who follows you upstairs and down like a dog Whose features still give me such a strange thrill sometimes I half fear your fair looks yet child You don t you can t Mamma I am sorry papa was not good I do so wish he had been Wickedness spoils and poisons all pleasant things It kills love If you and I thought each other wicked we could not love each other could we And if we could not trust each other Cary How miserable we should be Mother before I knew you I had an apprehension that you were not good that I could not esteem you That dread damped my wish to see you And now my heart is elate because I find you perfect almost kind clever nice Your sole fault is that you are old fashioned and of that I shall cure you <PERSON>Mamma</PERSON> put your work down read to me I like your southern accent it is so pure so soft It has no rugged burr no nasal twang such as almost every one s voice here in the north has My uncle and Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> say that you are a fine reader mamma Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said he never heard any lady read with such propriety of expression or purity of accent I wish I could reciprocate the compliment <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> but really the first time I heard your truly excellent friend read and preach I could not understand his broad northern tongue Could you understand me mamma Did I seem to speak roughly No I almost wished you had as I wished you had looked unpolished Your father <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> naturally spoke well quite otherwise than your worthy uncle correctly gently smoothly You inherit the gift Poor papa When he was so agreeable why was he not good Why he was _as_ he was and happily of that you child can form no conception I cannot tell It is a deep mystery The key is in the hands of his Maker There I leave it Mamma you will keep stitching stitching away Put down the sewing I am an enemy to it It cumbers your lap and I want it for my head it engages your eyes and I want them for a book Here is your favourite Cowper These importunities were the mother s pleasure If ever she delayed compliance it was only to hear them repeated and to enjoy her child s soft half playful half petulant urgency And then when she yielded <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> would say archly You will spoil me mamma I always thought I should like to be spoiled and I find it very sweet So did Mrs Pryor CHAPTER XXVI OLD COPY BOOKS By the time the Fieldhead party returned to <PERSON>Briarfield Caroline</PERSON> was nearly well Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> who had received news by post of her friend s convalescence hardly suffered an hour to elapse between her arrival at home and her first call at the rectory A shower of rain was falling gently yet fast on the late flowers and russet autumn shrubs when the garden wicket was heard to swing open and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s well known form passed the window On her entrance her feelings were evinced in her own peculiar fashion When deeply moved by serious fears or joys she was not garrulous The strong emotion was rarely suffered to influence her tongue and even her eye refused it more than a furtive and fitful conquest She took <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in her arms gave her one look one kiss then said You are better And a minute after I see you are safe now but take care God grant your health may be called on to sustain no more shocks She proceeded to talk fluently about the journey In the midst of vivacious discourse her eye still wandered to Caroline There spoke in its light a deep solicitude some trouble and some amaze She may be better it said but how weak she still is What peril she has come through Suddenly her glance reverted to Mrs Pryor It pierced her through When will my governess return to me she asked May I tell her all demanded <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> of her mother Leave being signified by a gesture <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was presently enlightened on what had happened in her absence Very good was the cool comment very good But it is no news to me What did you know I guessed long since the whole business I have heard somewhat of <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> s history not from herself but from others With every detail of Mr <PERSON>James Helstone</PERSON> s career and character I was acquainted An afternoon s sitting and conversation with Miss <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> had rendered me familiar therewith also he is one of Mrs <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s warning examples one of the blood red lights she hangs out to scare young ladies from matrimony I believe I should have been sceptical about the truth of the portrait traced by such fingers both these ladies take a dark pleasure in offering to view the dark side of life but I questioned Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> on the subject and he said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> my woman if you want to know aught about yond <PERSON>James Helstone</PERSON> I can only say he was a man tiger He was handsome dissolute soft treacherous courteous cruel <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t cry Cary we ll say no more about it I am not crying <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> or if I am it is nothing Go on you are no friend if you withhold from me the truth I hate that false plan of disguising mutilating the truth Fortunately I have said pretty nearly all that I have to say except that your uncle himself confirmed Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> s words for he too scorns a lie and deals in none of those conventional subterfuges that are shabbier than lies But papa is dead they should let him alone now They should and we _will_ let him alone Cry away <PERSON>Cary</PERSON> it will do you good It is wrong to check natural tears Besides I choose to please myself by sharing an idea that at this moment beams in your mother s eye while she looks at you Every drop blots out a sin Weep your tears have the virtue which the rivers of <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> lacked Like <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> they can cleanse a leprous memory Madam she continued addressing <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> did you think I could be daily in the habit of seeing you and your daughter together marking your marvellous similarity in many points observing pardon me your irrepressible emotions in the presence and still more in the absence of your child and not form my own conjectures I formed them and they are literally correct I shall begin to think myself shrewd And you said nothing observed <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> who soon regained the quiet control of her feelings Nothing I had no warrant to breathe a word on the subject _My_ business it was not I abstained from making it such You guessed so deep a secret and did not hint that you guessed it Is that so difficult It is not like you How do you know You are not reserved you are frankly communicative I may be communicative yet know where to stop In showing my treasure I may withhold a gem or two a curious unbought graven stone an amulet of whose mystic glitter I rarely permit even myself a glimpse Good day <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> thus seemed to get a view of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s character under a novel aspect Ere long the prospect was renewed it opened upon her No sooner had she regained sufficient strength to bear a change of scene the excitement of a little society than Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> sued daily for her presence at Fieldhead Whether <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> had become wearied of her honoured relatives is not known She did not say she was but she claimed and retained <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> with an eagerness which proved that an addition to that worshipful company was not unwelcome The Sympsons were church people Of course the rector s niece was received by them with courtesy Mr <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> proved to be a man of spotless respectability worrying temper pious principles and worldly views his lady was a very good woman patient kind well bred She had been brought up on a narrow system of views starved on a few prejudices a mere handful of bitter herbs a few preferences soaked till their natural flavour was extracted and with no seasoning added in the cooking some excellent principles made up in a stiff raised crust of bigotry difficult to digest Far too submissive was she to complain of this diet or to ask for a crumb beyond it The daughters were an example to their sex They were tall with a Roman nose apiece They had been educated faultlessly All they did was well done History and the most solid books had cultivated their minds Principles and opinions they possessed which could not be mended More exactly regulated lives feelings manners habits it would have been difficult to find anywhere They knew by heart a certain young ladies schoolroom code of laws on language demeanour etc themselves never deviated from its curious little pragmatical provisions and they regarded with secret whispered horror all deviations in others The Abomination of Desolation was no mystery to them they had discovered that unutterable Thing in the characteristic others call Originality Quick were they to recognize the signs of this evil and wherever they saw its trace whether in look word or deed whether they read it in the fresh vigorous style of a book or listened to it in interesting unhackneyed pure expressive language they shuddered they recoiled Danger was above their heads peril about their steps What was this strange thing Being unintelligible it must be bad Let it be denounced and chained up <PERSON>Henry Sympson</PERSON> the only son and youngest child of the family was a boy of fifteen He generally kept with his tutor When he left him he sought his cousin <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> This boy differed from his sisters He was little lame and pale his large eyes shone somewhat languidly in a wan orbit They were indeed usually rather dim but they were capable of illumination At times they could not only shine but blaze Inward emotion could likewise give colour to his cheek and decision to his crippled movements <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> s mother loved him she thought his peculiarities were a mark of election He was not like other children she allowed She believed him regenerate a new <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON> called of God from his birth He was to be a clergyman Mr and the Misses <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> not understanding the youth let him much alone <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> made him her pet and he made <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> his playmate In the midst of this family circle or rather outside it moved the tutor the satellite Yes <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> was a satellite of the house of Sympson connected yet apart ever attendant ever distant Each member of that correct family treated him with proper dignity The father was austerely civil sometimes irritable the mother being a kind woman was attentive but formal the daughters saw in him an abstraction not a man It seemed by their manner that their brother s tutor did not live for them They were learned so was he but not for them They were accomplished he had talents too imperceptible to their senses The most spirited sketch from his fingers was a blank to their eyes the most original observation from his lips fell unheard on their ears Nothing could exceed the propriety of their behaviour I should have said nothing could have equalled it but I remember a fact which strangely astonished <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> It was to discover that her cousin had absolutely _no_ sympathizing friend at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> that to Miss Keeldar he was as much a mere teacher as little a gentleman as little a man as to the estimable Misses Sympson What had befallen the kind hearted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> that she should be so indifferent to the dreary position of a fellow creature thus isolated under her roof She was not perhaps haughty to him but she never noticed him she let him alone He came and went spoke or was silent and she rarely recognized his existence As to <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> himself he had the air of a man used to this life and who had made up his mind to bear it for a time His faculties seemed walled up in him and were unmurmuring in their captivity He never laughed he seldom smiled he was uncomplaining He fulfilled the round of his duties scrupulously His pupil loved him he asked nothing more than civility from the rest of the world It even appeared that he would accept nothing more in that abode at least for when his cousin <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> made gentle overtures of friendship he did not encourage them he rather avoided than sought her One living thing alone besides his pale crippled scholar he fondled in the house and that was the ruffianly Tartar who sullen and impracticable to others acquired a singular partiality for him a partiality so marked that sometimes when <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> summoned to a meal entered the room and sat down unwelcomed Tartar would rise from his lair at <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s feet and betake himself to the taciturn tutor Once but once she noticed the desertion and holding out her white hand and speaking softly tried to coax him back Tartar looked slavered and sighed as his manner was but yet disregarded the invitation and coolly settled himself on his haunches at <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> s side That gentleman drew the dog s big black muzzled head on to his knee patted him and smiled one little smile to himself An acute observer might have remarked in the course of the same evening that after <PERSON>Tartar</PERSON> had resumed his allegiance to <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and was once more couched near her footstool the audacious tutor by one word and gesture fascinated him again He pricked up his ears at the word he started erect at the gesture and came with head lovingly depressed to receive the expected caress As it was given the significant smile again rippled across <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s quiet face <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> one day as they two were sitting alone in the summer house did you know that my cousin <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> was tutor in your uncle s family before the Sympsons came down here <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s reply was not so prompt as her responses usually were but at last she answered Yes of course I knew it well I thought you must have been aware of the circumstance Well what then It puzzles me to guess how it chanced that you never mentioned it to me Why should it puzzle you It seems odd I cannot account for it You talk a great deal you talk freely How was that circumstance never touched on Because it never was and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> laughed You are a singular being observed her friend I thought I knew you quite well I begin to find myself mistaken You were silent as the grave about <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and now again here is another secret But why you made it a secret is the mystery to me I never made it a secret I had no reason for so doing If you had asked me who <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> s tutor was I would have told you Besides I thought you knew I am puzzled about more things than one in this matter You don t like poor Louis Why Are you impatient at what you perhaps consider his _servile_ position Do you wish that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s brother were more highly placed <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s brother indeed was the exclamation uttered in a tone like the accents of scorn and with a movement of proud impatience <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> snatched a rose from a branch peeping through the open lattice Yes repeated <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> with mild firmness <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s brother He _is_ thus closely related to G rard <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> of the Hollow though nature has not given him features so handsome or an air so noble as his kinsman but his blood is as good and he is as much a gentleman were he free Wise humble pious <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> exclaimed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> ironically Men and angels hear her We should not despise plain features nor a laborious yet honest occupation should we Look at the subject of your panegyric He is there in the garden she continued pointing through an aperture in the clustering creepers and by that aperture <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> was visible coming slowly down the walk He is not ugly <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> pleaded <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> he is not ignoble He is sad silence seals his mind But I believe him to be intelligent and be certain if he had not something very commendable in his disposition Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> would never seek his society as he does <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> laughed she laughed again each time with a slightly sarcastic sound Well well was her comment On the plea of the man being <ORGANIZATION>Cyril Hall</ORGANIZATION> s friend and <PERSON>Robert Moore</PERSON> s brother we ll just tolerate his existence won t we Cary You believe him to be intelligent do you Not quite an idiot eh Something commendable in his disposition _id est_ not an absolute ruffian Good Your representations have weight with me and to prove that they have should he come this way I will speak to him He approached the summer house Unconscious that it was tenanted he sat down on the step Tartar now his customary companion had followed him and he couched across his feet Old boy said <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> pulling his tawny ear or rather the mutilated remains of that organ torn and chewed in a hundred battles the autumn sun shines as pleasantly on us as on the fairest and richest This garden is none of ours but we enjoy its greenness and perfume don t we He sat silent still caressing Tartar who slobbered with exceeding affection A faint twittering commenced among the trees round Something fluttered down as light as leaves They were little birds which lighting on the sward at shy distance hopped as if expectant The small brown elves actually remember that I fed them the other day again soliloquized Louis They want some more biscuit To day I forgot to save a fragment Eager little sprites I have not a crumb for you He put his hand in his pocket and drew it out empty A want easily supplied whispered the listening Miss Keeldar She took from her reticule a morsel of sweet cake for that repository was never destitute of something available to throw to the chickens young ducks or sparrows She crumbled it and bending over his shoulder put the crumbs into his hand There said she there is a providence for the improvident This September afternoon is pleasant observed <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> as not at all discomposed he calmly cast the crumbs on to the grass Even for you As pleasant for me as for any monarch You take a sort of harsh solitary triumph in drawing pleasure out of the elements and the inanimate and lower animate creation Solitary but not harsh With animals I feel I am <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> s son the heir of him to whom dominion was given over every living thing that moveth upon the earth Your dog likes and follows me When I go into that yard the pigeons from your dovecot flutter at my feet Your mare in the stable knows me as well as it knows you and obeys me better And my roses smell sweet to you and my trees give you shade And continued <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> no caprice can withdraw these pleasures from me they are _mine_ He walked off Tartar followed him as if in duty and affection bound and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> remained standing on the summer house step <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> saw her face as she looked after the rude tutor It was pale as if her pride bled inwardly You see remarked <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> apologetically his feelings are so often hurt it makes him morose You see retorted <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> with ire he is a topic on which you and I shall quarrel if we discuss it often so drop it henceforward and for ever I suppose he has more than once behaved in this way thought <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to herself and that renders <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> so distant to him Yet I wonder she cannot make allowance for character and circumstances I wonder the general modesty manliness sincerity of his nature do not plead with her in his behalf She is not often so inconsiderate so irritable The verbal testimony of two friends of <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> s to her cousin s character augmented her favourable opinion of him <PERSON>William Farren</PERSON> whose cottage he had visited in company with Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> pronounced him a real gentleman there was not such another in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> He <PERSON>William</PERSON> could do aught for that man And then to see how t bairns liked him and how t wife took to him first minute she saw him He never went into a house but t childer wor about him directly Them little things wor like as if they d a keener sense nor grown up folks i finding our folk s natures Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> in answer to a question of Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> s as to what he thought of <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> replied promptly that he was the best fellow he had met with since he left <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> But he is so grave objected <PERSON>Caroline Grave</PERSON> the finest company in the world Full of odd quiet out of the way humour Never enjoyed an excursion so much in my life as the one I took with him to the Lakes His understanding and tastes are so superior it does a man good to be within their influence and as to his temper and nature I call them fine At <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> he looks gloomy and I believe has the character of being misanthropical Oh I fancy he is rather out of place there in a false position The Sympsons are most estimable people but not the folks to comprehend him They think a great deal about form and ceremony which are quite out of <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> s way I don t think Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> likes him She doesn t know him she doesn t know him otherwise she has sense enough to do justice to his merits Well I suppose she doesn t know him mused <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> to herself and by this hypothesis she endeavoured to account for what seemed else unaccountable But such simple solution of the difficulty was not left her long She was obliged to refuse Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> even this negative excuse for her prejudice One day she chanced to be in the schoolroom with <PERSON>Henry Sympson</PERSON> whose amiable and affectionate disposition had quickly recommended him to her regard The boy was busied about some mechanical contrivance his lameness made him fond of sedentary occupation He began to ransack his tutor s desk for a piece of wax or twine necessary to his work <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> happened to be absent Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> indeed had called for him to take a long walk <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> could not immediately find the object of his search He rummaged compartment after compartment and at last opening an inner drawer he came upon not a ball of cord or a lump of beeswax but a little bundle of small marble coloured cahiers tied with tape <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> looked at them What rubbish Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> stores up in his desk he said I hope he won t keep my old exercises so carefully What is it Old copy books He threw the bundle to <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> The packet looked so neat externally her curiosity was excited to see its contents If they are only copy books I suppose I may open them Oh yes quite freely Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s desk is half mine for he lets me keep all sorts of things in it and I give you leave On scrutiny they proved to be French compositions written in a hand peculiar but compact and exquisitely clean and clear The writing was recognizable She scarcely needed the further evidence of the name signed at the close of each theme to tell her whose they were Yet that name astonished her <PERSON>Shirley Keeldar Sympson Grove</PERSON> shire a southern county and a date four years back She tied up the packet and held it in her hand meditating over it She half felt as if in opening it she had violated a confidence They are <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s you see said <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> carelessly Did _you_ give them to Mr <PERSON>Moore She</PERSON> wrote them with <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> I suppose She wrote them in my schoolroom at <LOCATION>Sympson Grove</LOCATION> when she lived with us there Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> taught her French it is his native language I know Was she a good pupil <PERSON>Henry She</PERSON> was a wild laughing thing but pleasant to have in the room She made lesson time charming She learned fast you could hardly tell when or how French was nothing to her She spoke it quick quick as quick as Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> himself Was she obedient Did she give trouble She gave plenty of trouble in a way She was giddy but I liked her I m desperately fond of <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> _Desperately_ fond you small simpleton You don t know what you say I _am desperately_ fond of her She is the light of my eyes I said so to Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> last night He would reprove you for speaking with exaggeration He didn t He never reproves and reproves as girls governesses do He was reading and he only smiled into his book and said that if Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was no more than that she was less than he took her to be for I was but a dim eyed short sighted little chap I m afraid I am a poor unfortunate Miss <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> I am a cripple you know Never mind <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> you are a very nice little fellow and if God has not given you health and strength He has given you a good disposition and an excellent heart and brain I shall be despised I sometimes think both <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and you despise me Listen <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> Generally I don t like schoolboys I have a great horror of them They seem to me little ruffians who take an unnatural delight in killing and tormenting birds and insects and kittens and whatever is weaker than themselves But you are so different I am quite fond of you You have almost as much sense as a man far more God wot she muttered to herself than many men you are fond of reading and you can talk sensibly about what you read I _am_ fond of reading I know I have sense and I know I have feeling Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> here entered <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> she said I have brought your lunch here I shall prepare it for you myself She placed on the table a glass of new milk a plate of something which looked not unlike leather and a utensil which resembled a toasting fork What are you two about she continued ransacking Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s desk Looking at your old copy books returned <PERSON>Caroline My</PERSON> old copy books French exercise books Look here They must be held precious they are kept carefully She showed the bundle <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> snatched it up Did not know one was in existence she said I thought the whole lot had long since lit the kitchen fire or curled the maid s hair at <LOCATION>Sympson Grove What</LOCATION> made you keep them <PERSON>Henry It</PERSON> is not my doing I should not have thought of it It never entered my head to suppose copy books of value Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> put them by in the inner drawer of his desk Perhaps he forgot them C est cela He forgot them no doubt echoed <PERSON>Shirley They</PERSON> are extremely well written she observed complacently What a giddy girl you were <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in those days I remember you so well A slim light creature whom though you were so tall I could lift off the floor I see you with your long countless curls on your shoulders and your streaming sash You used to make Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> lively that is at first I believe you grieved him after a while <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> turned the closely written pages and said nothing Presently she observed That was written one winter afternoon It was a description of a snow scene I remember said <PERSON>Henry Mr Moore</PERSON> when he read it cried Voil le Fran ais gagn He said it was well done Afterwards you made him draw in sepia the landscape you described You have not forgotten then <PERSON>Hal Not</PERSON> at all We were all scolded that day for not coming down to tea when called I can remember my tutor sitting at his easel and you standing behind him holding the candle and watching him draw the snowy cliff the pine the deer couched under it and the half moon hung above Where are his drawings <PERSON>Harry Caroline</PERSON> should see them In his portfolio But it is padlocked he has the key Ask him for it when he comes in You should ask him <PERSON>Shirley You</PERSON> are shy of him now You are grown a proud lady to him I notice that <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> you are a real enigma whispered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> in her ear What queer discoveries I make day by day now I who thought I had your confidence Inexplicable creature even this boy reproves you I have forgotten auld lang syne you see <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> said Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> answering young <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> and not heeding <PERSON>Caroline Which</PERSON> you never should have done You don t deserve to be a man s morning star if you have so short a memory A man s morning star indeed and by a man is meant your worshipful self I suppose Come drink your new milk while it is warm The young cripple rose and limped towards the fire he had left his crutch near the mantelpiece My poor lame darling murmured <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in her softest voice aiding him Whether do you like me or Mr <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> best <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> inquired the boy as she settled him in an arm chair O <PERSON>Harry Sam Wynne</PERSON> is my aversion you are my pet Me or Mr <PERSON>Malone You</PERSON> again a thousand times Yet they are great whiskered fellows six feet high each Whereas as long as you live <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> you will never be anything more than a little pale lameter Yes I know You need not be sorrowful Have I not often told you who was almost as little as pale as suffering as you and yet potent as a giant and brave as a lion Admiral Horatio Admiral <PERSON>Horatio Viscount Nelson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duke of Bronte</PERSON> great at heart as a Titan gallant and heroic as all the world and age of chivalry leader of the might of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> commander of her strength on the deep hurler of her thunder over the flood A great man But I am not warlike <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and yet my mind is so restless I burn day and night for what I can hardly tell to be to do to suffer I think Harry it is your mind which is stronger and older than your frame that troubles you It is a captive it lies in physical bondage But it will work its own redemption yet Study carefully not only books but the world You love nature love her without fear Be patient wait the course of time You will not be a soldier or a sailor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> but if you live you will be listen to my prophecy you will be an author perhaps a poet An author It is a flash a flash of light to me I will I _will_ I ll write a book that I may dedicate it to you You will write it that you may give your soul its natural release Bless me what am I saying more than I understand I believe or can make good Here <PERSON>Hal</PERSON> here is your toasted oatcake eat and live Willingly here cried a voice outside the open window I know that fragrance of meal bread Miss Keeldar may I come in and partake Mr Hall it was Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and with him was <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> returned from their walk there is a proper luncheon laid out in the dining room and there are proper people seated round it You may join that society and share that fare if you please but if your ill regulated tastes lead you to prefer ill regulated proceedings step in here and do as we do I approve the perfume and therefore shall suffer myself to be led by the nose returned Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> who presently entered accompanied by <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> That gentleman s eye fell on his desk pillaged Burglars said he <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> you merit the ferule Give it to <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> they did it was alleged with more attention to effect than truth Traitor and false witness cried both the girls We never laid hands on a thing except in the spirit of laudable inquiry Exactly so said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> with his rare smile And what have you ferreted out in your spirit of laudable inquiry He perceived the inner drawer open This is empty said he Who has taken Here here <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> hastened to say and she restored the little packet to its place He shut it up he locked it in with a small key attached to his watch guard he restored the other papers to order closed the repository and sat down without further remark I thought you would have scolded much more sir said <PERSON>Henry The</PERSON> girls deserve reprimand I leave them to their own consciences It accuses them of crimes intended as well as perpetrated sir If I had not been here they would have treated your portfolio as they have done your desk but I told them it was padlocked And will you have lunch with us here interposed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> addressing <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and desirous as it seemed to turn the conversation Certainly if I may You will be restricted to new milk and <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> oatcake Va pour le lait frais said <PERSON>Louis But</PERSON> for your oatcake and he made a grimace He cannot eat it said <PERSON>Henry He</PERSON> thinks it is like bran raised with sour yeast Come then by special dispensation we will allow him a few cracknels but nothing less homely The hostess rang the bell and gave her frugal orders which were presently executed She herself measured out the milk and distributed the bread round the cosy circle now enclosing the bright little schoolroom fire She then took the post of toaster general and kneeling on the rug fork in hand fulfilled her office with dexterity Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> who relished any homely innovation on ordinary usages and to whom the husky oatcake was from custom suave as manna seemed in his best spirits He talked and laughed gleefully now with <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> whom he had fixed by his side now with <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and again with <PERSON>Louis Moore And Louis</PERSON> met him in congenial spirit He did not laugh much but he uttered in the quietest tone the wittiest things Gravely spoken sentences marked by unexpected turns and a quite fresh flavour and poignancy fell easily from his lips He proved himself to be what <PERSON>Mr Hall</PERSON> had said he was excellent company <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> marvelled at his humour but still more at his entire self possession Nobody there present seemed to impose on him a sensation of unpleasant restraint Nobody seemed a bore a check a chill to him and yet there was the cool and lofty Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> kneeling before the fire almost at his feet But <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was cool and lofty no longer at least not at this moment She appeared unconscious of the humility of her present position or if conscious it was only to taste a charm in its lowliness It did not revolt her pride that the group to whom she voluntarily officiated as handmaid should include her cousin s tutor It did not scare her that while she handed the bread and milk to the rest she had to offer it to him also and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> took his portion from her hand as calmly as if he had been her equal You are overheated now he said when she had retained the fork for some time let me relieve you And he took it from her with a sort of quiet authority to which she submitted passively neither resisting him nor thanking him I should like to see your pictures <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> said <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> when the sumptuous luncheon was discussed Would not you Mr Hall To please you I should but for my own part I have cut him as an artist I had enough of him in that capacity in <LOCATION>Cumberland</LOCATION> and Westmoreland Many a wetting we got amongst the mountains because he would persist in sitting on a camp stool catching effects of rain clouds gathering mists fitful sunbeams and what not Here is the portfolio said <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> bringing it in one hand and leaning on his crutch with the other <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> took it but he still sat as if he wanted another to speak It seemed as if he would not open it unless the proud <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> deigned to show herself interested in the exhibition He makes us wait to whet our curiosity she said You understand opening it observed <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> giving her the key You spoiled the lock for me once try now He held it She opened it and monopolizing the contents had the first view of every sketch herself She enjoyed the treat if treat it were in silence without a single comment <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> stood behind her chair and looked over her shoulder and when she had done and the others were still gazing he left his post and paced through the room A carriage was heard in the lane the gate bell rang <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> started There are callers she said and I shall be summoned to the room A pretty figure as they say I am to receive company I and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> have been in the garden gathering fruit half the morning Oh for rest under my own vine and my own fig tree Happy is the slave wife of the Indian chief in that she has no drawing room duty to perform but can sit at ease weaving mats and stringing beads and peacefully flattening her pickaninny s head in an unmolested corner of her wigwam I ll emigrate to the western woods <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> laughed To marry a White Cloud or a Big Buffalo and after wedlock to devote yourself to the tender task of digging your lord s maize field while he smokes his pipe or drinks fire water <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> seemed about to reply but here the schoolroom door unclosed admitting Mr Sympson That personage stood aghast when he saw the group around the fire I thought you alone Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> he said I find quite a party And evidently from his shocked scandalized air had he not recognized in one of the party a clergyman he would have delivered an extempore philippic on the extraordinary habits of his niece respect for the cloth arrested him I merely wished to announce he proceeded coldly that the family from <LOCATION>De Walden Hall</LOCATION> Mr Mrs the Misses and Mr <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> are in the drawing room And he bowed and withdrew The family from <ORGANIZATION>De Walden Hall Couldn</ORGANIZATION> t be a worse set murmured <PERSON>Shirley She</PERSON> sat still looking a little contumacious and very much indisposed to stir She was flushed with the fire Her dark hair had been more than once dishevelled by the morning wind that day Her attire was a light neatly fitting but amply flowing dress of muslin the shawl she had worn in the garden was still draped in a careless fold round her Indolent wilful picturesque and singularly pretty was her aspect prettier than usual as if some soft inward emotion stirred who knows how had given new bloom and expression to her features <PERSON>Shirley Shirley</PERSON> you ought to go whispered <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I wonder why She lifted her eyes and saw in the glass over the fireplace both Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> gazing at her gravely If she said with a yielding smile if a majority of the present company maintain that the <ORGANIZATION>De Walden Hall</ORGANIZATION> people have claims on my civility I will subdue my inclinations to my duty Let those who think I ought to go hold up their hands Again consulting the mirror it reflected an unanimous vote against her You must go said Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and behave courteously too You owe many duties to society It is not permitted you to please only yourself <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> assented with a low Hear hear <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> approaching her smoothed her wavy curls gave to her attire a less artistic and more domestic grace and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was put out of the room protesting still by a pouting lip against her dismissal There is a curious charm about her observed Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> when she was gone And now he added I must away for <PERSON>Sweeting</PERSON> is off to see his mother and there are two funerals <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> get your books it is lesson time said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> sitting down to his desk A curious charm repeated the pupil when he and his master were left alone True Is she not a kind of white witch he asked Of whom are you speaking sir Of my cousin <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> No irrelevant questions study in silence Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> looked and spoke sternly sourly <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> knew this mood It was a rare one with his tutor but when it came he had an awe of it He obeyed CHAPTER XXVII THE FIRST BLUESTOCKING Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and her uncle had characters that would not harmonize that never had harmonized He was irritable and she was spirited He was despotic and she liked freedom He was worldly and she perhaps romantic Not without purpose had he come down to <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> His mission was clear and he intended to discharge it conscientiously He anxiously desired to have his niece married to make for her a suitable match give her in charge to a proper husband and wash his hands of her for ever The misfortune was from infancy upwards <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and he had disagreed on the meaning of the words suitable and proper She never yet had accepted his definition and it was doubtful whether in the most important step of her life she would consent to accept it The trial soon came Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> proposed in form for his son <PERSON>Samuel Fawthrop Wynne</PERSON> Decidedly suitable most proper pronounced Mr Sympson A fine unencumbered estate real substance good connections _It must be done _ He sent for his niece to the oak parlour he shut himself up there with her alone he communicated the offer he gave his opinion he claimed her consent It was withheld No I shall not marry <PERSON>Samuel Fawthrop Wynne</PERSON> I ask why I must have a reason In all respects he is more than worthy of you She stood on the hearth She was pale as the white marble slab and cornice behind her her eyes flashed large dilated unsmiling And _I_ ask in what sense that young man is worthy of _me_ He has twice your money twice your common sense equal connections equal respectability Had he my money counted fivescore times I would take no vow to love him Please to state your objections He has run a course of despicable commonplace profligacy Accept that as the first reason why I spurn him Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> you shock me That conduct alone sinks him in a gulf of immeasurable inferiority His intellect reaches no standard I can esteem there is a second stumbling block His views are narrow his feelings are blunt his tastes are coarse his manners vulgar The man is a respectable wealthy man To refuse him is presumption on your part I refuse point blank Cease to annoy me with the subject I forbid it Is it your intention ever to marry or do you prefer celibacy I deny your right to claim an answer to that question May I ask if you expect some man of title some peer of the realm to demand your hand I doubt if the peer breathes on whom I would confer it Were there insanity in the family I should believe you mad Your eccentricity and conceit touch the verge of frenzy Perhaps ere I have finished you will see me over leap it I anticipate no less Frantic and impracticable girl Take warning I dare you to sully our name by a _m salliance_ _Our_ name Am _I_ called Sympson God be thanked that you are not But be on your guard I will not be trifled with What in the name of common law and common sense would you or could you do if my pleasure led me to a choice you disapproved Take care take care warning her with voice and hand that trembled alike Why What shadow of power have _you_ over me Why should I fear you Take care madam Scrupulous care I will take Mr Sympson Before I marry I am resolved to esteem to admire to _love_ Preposterous stuff indecorous unwomanly To love with my whole heart I know I speak in an unknown tongue but I feel indifferent whether I am comprehended or not And if this love of yours should fall on a beggar On a beggar it will never fall Mendicancy is not estimable On a low clerk a play actor a play writer or or Take courage Mr Sympson Or what Any literary scrub or shabby whining artist For the scrubby shabby whining I have no taste for literature and the arts I have And there I wonder how your <PERSON>Fawthrop Wynne</PERSON> would suit me He cannot write a note without orthographical errors he reads only a sporting paper he was the booby of Stilbro grammar school Unladylike language Great God to what will she come He lifted hands and eyes Never to the altar of Hymen with <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> To what will she come Why are not the laws more stringent that I might compel her to hear reason Console yourself uncle Were <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> a serfdom and you the Czar you could not _compel_ me to this step _I_ will write to Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> Give yourself no further trouble on the subject Fortune is proverbially called changeful yet her caprice often takes the form of repeating again and again a similar stroke of luck in the same quarter It appeared that Miss Keeldar or her fortune had by this time made a sensation in the district and produced an impression in quarters by her unthought of No less than three offers followed Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> s all more or less eligible All were in succession pressed on her by her uncle and all in succession she refused Yet amongst them was more than one gentleman of unexceptionable character as well as ample wealth Many besides her uncle asked what she meant and whom she expected to entrap that she was so insolently fastidious At last the gossips thought they had found the key to her conduct and her uncle was sure of it and what is more the discovery showed his niece to him in quite a new light and he changed his whole deportment to her accordingly <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> had of late been fast growing too hot to hold them both The suave aunt could not reconcile them the daughters froze at the view of their quarrels <PERSON>Gertrude</PERSON> and <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> whispered by the hour together in their dressing room and became chilled with decorous dread if they chanced to be left alone with their audacious cousin But as I have said a change supervened Mr <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> was appeased and his family tranquillized The village of <LOCATION>Nunnely</LOCATION> has been alluded to its old church its forest its monastic ruins It had also its hall called the priory an older a larger a more lordly abode than any <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> or <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> owned and what is more it had its man of title its baronet which neither <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> nor Whinbury could boast This possession its proudest and most prized had for years been nominal only The present baronet a young man hitherto resident in a distant province was unknown on his <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> estate During Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s stay at the fashionable watering place of <LOCATION>Cliffbridge</LOCATION> she and her friends had met with and been introduced to Sir Philip Nunnely They encountered him again and again on the sands the cliffs in the various walks sometimes at the public balls of the place He seemed solitary His manner was very unpretending too simple to be termed affable rather timid than proud He did not _condescend_ to their society he seemed _glad_ of it With any unaffected individual <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> could easily and quickly cement an acquaintance She walked and talked with Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> she her aunt and cousins sometimes took a sail in his yacht She liked him because she found him kind and modest and was charmed to feel she had the power to amuse him One slight drawback there was where is the friendship without it Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> had a literary turn He wrote poetry sonnets stanzas ballads Perhaps Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> thought him a little too fond of reading and reciting these compositions perhaps she wished the rhyme had possessed more accuracy the measure more music the tropes more freshness the inspiration more fire At any rate she always winced when he recurred to the subject of his poems and usually did her best to divert the conversation into another channel He would beguile her to take moonlight walks with him on the bridge for the sole purpose as it seemed of pouring into her ear the longest of his ballads He would lead her away to sequestered rustic seats whence the rush of the surf to the sands was heard soft and soothing and when he had her all to himself and the sea lay before them and the scented shade of gardens spread round and the tall shelter of cliffs rose behind them he would pull out his last batch of sonnets and read them in a voice tremulous with emotion He did not seem to know that though they might be rhyme they were not poetry It appeared by <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s downcast eye and disturbed face that she knew it and felt heartily mortified by the single foible of this good and amiable gentleman Often she tried as gently as might be to wean him from this fanatic worship of the Muses It was his monomania on all ordinary subjects he was sensible enough and fain was she to engage him in ordinary topics He questioned her sometimes about his place at <LOCATION>Nunnely</LOCATION> she was but too happy to answer his interrogatories at length She never wearied of describing the antique priory the wild silvan park the hoary church and hamlet nor did she fail to counsel him to come down and gather his tenantry about him in his ancestral halls Somewhat to her surprise Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> followed her advice to the letter and actually towards the close of September arrived at the priory He soon made a call at <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> and his first visit was not his last He said when he had achieved the round of the neighbourhood that under no roof had he found such pleasant shelter as beneath the massive oak beams of the gray manor house of <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> a cramped modest dwelling enough compared with his own but he liked it Presently it did not suffice to sit with <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in her panelled parlour where others came and went and where he could rarely find a quiet moment to show her the latest production of his fertile muse he must have her out amongst the pleasant pastures and lead her by the still waters _T te t te_ ramblings she shunned so he made parties for her to his own grounds his glorious forest to remoter scenes woods severed by the Wharfe vales watered by the Aire Such assiduity covered Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> with distinction Her uncle s prophetic soul anticipated a splendid future He already scented the time afar off when with nonchalant air and left foot nursed on his right knee he should be able to make dashingly familiar allusion to his nephew the baronet Now his niece dawned upon him no longer a mad girl but a most sensible woman He termed her in confidential dialogues with Mrs Sympson a truly superior person peculiar but very clever He treated her with exceeding deference rose reverently to open and shut doors for her reddened his face and gave himself headaches with stooping to pick up gloves handkerchiefs and other loose property whereof <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> usually held but insecure tenure He would cut mysterious jokes about the superiority of woman s wit over man s wisdom commence obscure apologies for the blundering mistake he had committed respecting the generalship the tactics of a personage not a hundred miles from <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> In short he seemed elate as any midden cock on pattens His niece viewed his man uvres and received his innuendoes with phlegm apparently she did not above half comprehend to what aim they tended When plainly charged with being the preferred of the baronet she said she believed he did like her and for her part she liked him She had never thought a man of rank the only son of a proud fond mother the only brother of doting sisters could have so much goodness and on the whole so much sense <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> proved indeed that Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> liked her Perhaps he had found in her that curious charm noticed by Mr Hall He sought her presence more and more and at last with a frequency that attested it had become to him an indispensable stimulus About this time strange feelings hovered round <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> restless hopes and haggard anxieties haunted some of its rooms There was an unquiet wandering of some of the inmates among the still fields round the mansion there was a sense of expectancy that kept the nerves strained One thing seemed clear Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was not a man to be despised He was amiable if not highly intellectual he was intelligent Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> could not affirm of him what she had so bitterly affirmed of <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> that his feelings were blunt his tastes coarse and his manners vulgar There was sensibility in his nature there was a very real if not a very discriminating love of the arts there was the English gentleman in all his deportment As to his lineage and wealth both were of course far beyond her claims His appearance had at first elicited some laughing though not ill natured remarks from the merry <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> It was boyish His features were plain and slight his hair sandy his stature insignificant But she soon checked her sarcasm on this point she would even fire up if any one else made uncomplimentary allusion thereto He had a pleasing countenance she affirmed and there was that in his heart which was better than three Roman noses than the locks of <PERSON>Absalom</PERSON> or the proportions of <PERSON>Saul</PERSON> A spare and rare shaft she still reserved for his unfortunate poetic propensity but even here she would tolerate no irony save her own In short matters had reached a point which seemed fully to warrant an observation made about this time by Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> to the tutor <PERSON>Louis Yond</PERSON> brother <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of yours seems to me to be either a fool or a madman Two months ago I could have sworn he had the game all in his own hands and there he runs the country and quarters himself up in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for weeks together and by the time he comes back he ll find himself checkmated <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune but once let slip never returns again I d write to <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> if I were you and remind him of that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> had views on Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> inquired <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> as if the idea was new to him Views I suggested to him myself and views he might have realized for she liked him As a neighbour As more than that I have seen her change countenance and colour at the mere mention of his name Write to the lad I say and tell him to come home He is a finer gentleman than this bit of a baronet after all Does it not strike you Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> that for a mere penniless adventurer to aspire to a rich woman s hand is presumptuous contemptible Oh if you are for high notions and double refined sentiment I ve naught to say I m a plain practical man myself and if <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is willing to give up that royal prize to a lad rival a puling slip of aristocracy I am quite agreeable At _his_ age in _his_ place with _his_ inducements I would have acted differently Neither baronet nor duke nor prince should have snatched my sweetheart from me without a struggle But you tutors are such solemn chaps it is almost like speaking to a parson to consult with you Flattered and fawned upon as <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> was just now it appeared she was not absolutely spoiled that her better nature did not quite leave her Universal report had indeed ceased to couple her name with that of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and this silence seemed sanctioned by her own apparent oblivion of the absentee but that she had not _quite_ forgotten him that she still regarded him if not with love yet with interest seemed proved by the increased attention which at this juncture of affairs a sudden attack of illness induced her to show that tutor brother of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s to whom she habitually bore herself with strange alternations of cool reserve and docile respect now sweeping past him in all the dignity of the moneyed heiress and prospective Lady Nunnely and anon accosting him as abashed school girls are wont to accost their stern professors bridling her neck of ivory and curling her lip of carmine if he encountered her glance one minute and the next submitting to the grave rebuke of his eye with as much contrition as if he had the power to inflict penalties in case of contumacy <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> had perhaps caught the fever which for a few days laid him low in one of the poor cottages of the district which he his lame pupil and Mr <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> were in the habit of visiting together At any rate he sickened and after opposing to the malady a taciturn resistance for a day or two was obliged to keep his chamber He lay tossing on his thorny bed one evening <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> who would not quit him watching faithfully beside him when a tap too light to be that of <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> or the housemaid summoned young <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> to the door How is Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to night asked a low voice from the dark gallery Come in and see him yourself Is he asleep I wish he could sleep Come and speak to him <PERSON>Shirley He</PERSON> would not like it But the speaker stepped in and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> seeing her hesitate on the threshold took her hand and drew her to the couch The shaded light showed Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s form but imperfectly yet it revealed her in elegant attire There was a party assembled below including Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> the ladies were now in the drawing room and their hostess had stolen from them to visit <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> s tutor Her pure white dress her fair arms and neck the trembling chainlet of gold circling her throat and quivering on her breast glistened strangely amid the obscurity of the sickroom Her mien was chastened and pensive She spoke gently Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> how are you to night I have not been very ill and am now better I heard that you complained of thirst I have brought you some grapes can you taste one No but I thank you for remembering me Just one From the rich cluster that filled a small basket held in her hand she severed a berry and offered it to his lips He shook his head and turned aside his flushed face But what then can I bring you instead You have no wish for fruit yet I see that your lips are parched What beverage do you prefer <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> supplies me with toast and water I like it best Silence fell for some minutes Do you suffer have you pain Very little What made you ill Silence I wonder what caused this fever To what do you attribute it Miasma perhaps malaria This is autumn a season fertile in fevers I hear you often visit the sick in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> and Nunnely too with Mr <PERSON>Hall You</PERSON> should be on your guard temerity is not wise That reminds me Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> that perhaps you had better not enter this chamber or come near this couch I do not believe my illness is infectious I scarcely fear with a sort of smile _you_ will take it but why should you run even the shadow of a risk Leave me Patience I will go soon but I should like to do something for you before I depart any little service They will miss you below No the gentlemen are still at table They will not linger long Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> is no wine bibber and I hear him just now pass from the dining room to the drawing room It is a servant It is Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> I know his step Your hearing is acute It is never dull and the sense seems sharpened at present Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was here to tea last night I heard you sing to him some song which he had brought you I heard him when he took his departure at eleven o clock call you out on to the pavement to look at the evening star You must be nervously sensitive I heard him kiss your hand Impossible No my chamber is over the hall the window just above the front door the sash was a little raised for I felt feverish You stood ten minutes with him on the steps I heard your discourse every word and I heard the salute <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> give me some water Let me give it him But he half rose to take the glass from young <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> and declined her attendance And can I do nothing Nothing for you cannot guarantee me a night s peaceful rest and it is all I at present want You do not sleep well Sleep has left me Yet you said you were not very ill I am often sleepless when in high health If I had power I would lap you in the most placid slumber quite deep and hushed without a dream Blank annihilation I do not ask that With dreams of all you most desire Monstrous delusions The sleep would be delirium the waking death Your wishes are not so chimerical you are no visionary Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> I suppose you think so but my character is not perhaps quite as legible to you as a page of the last new novel might be That is possible But this sleep I _should_ like to woo it to your pillow to win for you its favour If I took a book and sat down and read some pages I can well spare half an hour Thank you but I will not detain you I would read softly It would not do I am too feverish and excitable to bear a soft cooing vibrating voice close at my ear You had better leave me Well I will go And no good night Yes sir yes Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> good night Exit <PERSON>Shirley Henry</PERSON> my boy go to bed now it is time you had some repose Sir it would please me to watch at your bedside all night Nothing less called for I am getting better There go Give me your blessing sir God bless you my best pupil You never call me your dearest pupil No nor ever shall Possibly Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> resented her former teacher s rejection of her courtesy It is certain she did not repeat the offer of it Often as her light step traversed the gallery in the course of a day it did not again pause at his door nor did her cooing vibrating voice disturb a second time the hush of the sickroom A sickroom indeed it soon ceased to be Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s good constitution quickly triumphed over his indisposition In a few days he shook it off and resumed his duties as tutor That auld lang syne had still its authority both with preceptor and scholar was proved by the manner in which he sometimes promptly passed the distance she usually maintained between them and put down her high reserve with a firm quiet hand One afternoon the <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> family were gone out to take a carriage airing <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> never sorry to snatch a reprieve from their society had remained behind detained by business as she said The business a little letter writing was soon dispatched after the yard gates had closed on the carriage Miss Keeldar betook herself to the garden It was a peaceful autumn day The gilding of the Indian summer mellowed the pastures far and wide The russet woods stood ripe to be stripped but were yet full of leaf The purple of heath bloom faded but not withered tinged the hills The beck wandered down to the Hollow through a silent district no wind followed its course or haunted its woody borders Fieldhead gardens bore the seal of gentle decay On the walks swept that morning yellow leaves had fluttered down again Its time of flowers and even of fruits was over but a scantling of apples enriched the trees Only a blossom here and there expanded pale and delicate amidst a knot of faded leaves These single flowers the last of their race <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> culled as she wandered thoughtfully amongst the beds She was fastening into her girdle a hueless and scentless nosegay when <PERSON>Henry Sympson</PERSON> called to her as he came limping from the house <PERSON>Shirley Mr Moore</PERSON> would be glad to see you in the schoolroom and to hear you read a little French if you have no more urgent occupation The messenger delivered his commission very simply as if it were a mere matter of course Did Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> tell you to say that Certainly why not And now do come and let us once more be as we were at Sympson Grove We used to have pleasant school hours in those days Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> perhaps thought that circumstances were changed since then however she made no remark but after a little reflection quietly followed <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> Entering the schoolroom she inclined her head with a decent obeisance as had been her wont in former times She removed her bonnet and hung it up beside <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> s cap <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> sat at his desk turning the leaves of a book open before him and marking passages with his pencil He just moved in acknowledgment of her curtsy but did not rise You proposed to read to me a few nights ago said he I could not hear you then My attention is now at your service A little renewed practice in French may not be unprofitable Your accent I have observed begins to rust What book shall I take Here are the posthumous works of <ORGANIZATION>St Pierre Read</ORGANIZATION> a few pages of the Fragments de l Amazone She accepted the chair which he had placed in readiness near his own the volume lay on his desk there was but one between them her sweeping curls dropped so low as to hide the page from him Put back your hair he said For one moment <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> looked not quite certain whether she would obey the request or disregard it A flicker of her eye beamed furtive on the professor s face Perhaps if he had been looking at her harshly or timidly or if one undecided line had marked his countenance she would have rebelled and the lesson had ended there and then but he was only awaiting her compliance as calm as marble and as cool She threw the veil of tresses behind her ear It was well her face owned an agreeable outline and that her cheek possessed the polish and the roundness of early youth or thus robbed of a softening shade the contours might have lost their grace But what mattered that in the present society Neither Calypso nor Eucharis cared to fascinate Mentor She began to read The language had become strange to her tongue it faltered the lecture flowed unevenly impeded by hurried breath broken by Anglicized tones She stopped I can t do it Read me a paragraph if you please Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> What _he_ read _she_ repeated She caught his accent in three minutes Tr s bien was the approving comment at the close of the piece C est presque le Fran ais rattrap n est ce pas You could not write French as you once could I dare say Oh no I should make strange work of my concords now You could not compose the _devoir_ of <ORGANIZATION>La Premi</ORGANIZATION> re Femme Savante Do you still remember that rubbish Every line I doubt you I will engage to repeat it word for word You would stop short at the first line Challenge me to the experiment I challenge you He proceeded to recite the following He gave it in French but we must translate on pain of being unintelligible to some readers And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose This was in the dawn of time before the morning stars were set and while they yet sang together The epoch is so remote the mists and dewy gray of matin twilight veil it with so vague an obscurity that all distinct feature of custom all clear line of locality evade perception and baffle research It must suffice to know that the world then existed that men peopled it that man s nature with its passions sympathies pains and pleasures informed the planet and gave it soul A certain tribe colonized a certain spot on the globe of what race this tribe unknown in what region that spot untold We usually think of the East when we refer to transactions of that date but who shall declare that there was no life in the <LOCATION>West the South the North What</LOCATION> is to disprove that this tribe instead of camping under palm groves in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> wandered beneath island oak woods rooted in our own seas of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> It is no sandy plain nor any circumscribed and scant oasis I seem to realize A forest valley with rocky sides and brown profundity of shade formed by tree crowding on tree descends deep before me Here indeed dwell human beings but so few and in alleys so thick branched and overarched they are neither heard nor seen Are they savage Doubtless They live by the crook and the bow half shepherds half hunters their flocks wander wild as their prey Are they happy No not more happy than we are at this day Are they good No not better than ourselves Their nature is our nature human both There is one in this tribe too often miserable a child bereaved of both parents None cares for this child She is fed sometimes but oftener forgotten A hut rarely receives her the hollow tree and chill cavern are her home Forsaken lost and wandering she lives more with the wild beast and bird than with her own kind Hunger and cold are her comrades sadness hovers over and solitude besets her round Unheeded and unvalued she should die but she both lives and grows The green wilderness nurses her and becomes to her a mother feeds her on juicy berry on saccharine root and nut There is something in the air of this clime which fosters life kindly There must be something too in its dews which heals with sovereign balm Its gentle seasons exaggerate no passion no sense its temperature tends to harmony its breezes you would say bring down from heaven the germ of pure thought and purer feeling Not grotesquely fantastic are the forms of cliff and foliage not violently vivid the colouring of flower and bird In all the grandeur of these forests there is repose in all their freshness there is tenderness The gentle charm vouchsafed to flower and tree bestowed on deer and dove has not been denied to the human nursling All solitary she has sprung up straight and graceful Nature cast her features in a fine mould they have matured in their pure accurate first lines unaltered by the shocks of disease No fierce dry blast has dealt rudely with the surface of her frame no burning sun has crisped or withered her tresses Her form gleams ivory white through the trees her hair flows plenteous long and glossy her eyes not dazzled by vertical fires beam in the shade large and open and full and dewy Above those eyes when the breeze bares her forehead shines an expanse fair and ample a clear candid page whereon knowledge should knowledge ever come might write a golden record You see in the desolate young savage nothing vicious or vacant She haunts the wood harmless and thoughtful though of what one so untaught can think it is not easy to divine On the evening of one summer day before the Flood being utterly alone for she had lost all trace of her tribe who had wandered leagues away she knew not where she went up from the vale to watch Day take leave and Night arrive A crag overspread by a tree was her station The oak roots turfed and mossed gave a seat the oak boughs thick leaved wove a canopy Slow and grand the Day withdrew passing in purple fire and parting to the farewell of a wild low chorus from the woodlands Then Night entered quiet as death The wind fell the birds ceased singing Now every nest held happy mates and hart and hind slumbered blissfully safe in their lair The girl sat her body still her soul astir occupied however rather in feeling than in thinking in wishing than hoping in imagining than projecting She felt the world the sky the night boundlessly mighty Of all things herself seemed to herself the centre a small forgotten atom of life a spark of soul emitted inadvertent from the great creative source and now burning unmarked to waste in the heart of a black hollow She asked was she thus to burn out and perish her living light doing no good never seen never needed a star in an else starless firmament which nor shepherd nor wanderer nor sage nor priest tracked as a guide or read as a prophecy Could this be she demanded when the flame of her intelligence burned so vivid when her life beat so true and real and potent when something within her stirred disquieted and restlessly asserted a God given strength for which it insisted she should find exercise She gazed abroad on Heaven and Evening Heaven and Evening gazed back on her She bent down searching bank hill river spread dim below All she questioned responded by oracles She heard she was impressed but she could not understand Above her head she raised her hands joined together Guidance help comfort come was her cry There was no voice nor any that answered She waited kneeling steadfastly looking up Yonder sky was sealed the solemn stars shone alien and remote At last one overstretched chord of her agony slacked she thought Something above relented she felt as if Something far round drew nigher she heard as if Silence spoke There was no language no word only a tone Again a fine full lofty tone a deep soft sound like a storm whispering made twilight undulate Once more profounder nearer clearer it rolled harmonious Yet again a distinct voice passed between Heaven and Earth Eva If <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> were not this woman s name she had none She rose Here am I Eva O Night it can be but Night that speaks I am here The voice descending reached <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> Eva Lord she cried behold thine handmaid She had her religion all tribes held some creed I come a Comforter Lord come quickly The Evening flushed full of hope the Air panted the Moon rising before ascended large but her light showed no shape Lean towards me Eva Enter my arms repose thus Thus I lean O Invisible but felt And what art thou <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> I have brought a living draught from heaven Daughter of Man drink of my cup I drink it is as if sweetest dew visited my lips in a full current My arid heart revives my affliction is lightened my strait and struggle are gone And the night changes the wood the hill the moon the wide sky all change All change and for ever I take from thy vision darkness I loosen from thy faculties fetters I level in thy path obstacles I with my presence fill vacancy I claim as mine the lost atom of life I take to myself the spark of soul burning heretofore forgotten O take me O claim me This is a god This is a son of God one who feels himself in the portion of life that stirs you He is suffered to reclaim his own and so to foster and aid that it shall not perish hopeless A son of God Am I indeed chosen Thou only in this land I saw thee that thou wert fair I knew thee that thou wert mine To me it is given to rescue to sustain to cherish mine own Acknowledge in me that Seraph on earth named Genius My glorious Bridegroom true Dayspring from on high All I would have at last I possess I receive a revelation The dark hint the obscure whisper which have haunted me from childhood are interpreted Thou art He I sought Godborn take me thy bride Unhumbled I can take what is mine Did I not give from the altar the very flame which lit <PERSON>Eva</PERSON> s being Come again into the heaven whence thou wert sent That Presence invisible but mighty gathered her in like a lamb to the fold that voice soft but all pervading vibrated through her heart like music Her eye received no image and yet a sense visited her vision and her brain as of the serenity of stainless air the power of sovereign seas the majesty of marching stars the energy of colliding elements the rooted endurance of hills wide based and above all as of the lustre of heroic beauty rushing victorious on the Night vanquishing its shadows like a diviner sun Such was the bridal hour of Genius and Humanity Who shall rehearse the tale of their after union Who shall depict its bliss and bale Who shall tell how He between whom and the Woman God put enmity forged deadly plots to break the bond or defile its purity Who shall record the long strife between Serpent and Seraph How still the Father of Lies insinuated evil into good pride into wisdom grossness into glory pain into bliss poison into passion How the dreadless Angel defied resisted and repelled How again and again he refined the polluted cup exalted the debased emotion rectified the perverted impulse detected the lurking venom baffled the frontless temptation purified justified watched and withstood How by his patience by his strength by that unutterable excellence he held from God his Origin this faithful Seraph fought for Humanity a good fight through time and when <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> s course closed and Death was encountered at the end barring with fleshless arm the portals of Eternity how Genius still held close his dying bride sustained her through the agony of the passage bore her triumphant into his own home Heaven restored her redeemed to <PERSON>Jehovah</PERSON> her Maker and at last before Angel and Archangel crowned her with the crown of Immortality Who shall of these things write the chronicle I never could correct that composition observed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> as <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> concluded Your censor pencil scored it with condemnatory lines whose signification I strove vainly to fathom She had taken a crayon from the tutor s desk and was drawing little leaves fragments of pillars broken crosses on the margin of the book French may be half forgotten but the habits of the French lesson are retained I see said <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> My books would now as erst be unsafe with you My newly bound <PERSON>St Pierre</PERSON> would soon be like my Racine Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> her mark traced on every page <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> dropped her crayon as if it burned her fingers Tell me what were the faults of that _devoir_ she asked Were they grammatical errors or did you object to the substance I never said that the lines I drew were indications of faults at all You would have it that such was the case and I refrained from contradiction What else did they denote No matter now Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> cried <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> make <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> repeat some of the pieces she used to say so well by heart If I ask for any it will be <ORGANIZATION>Le Cheval Dompt</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> trimming with his penknife the pencil Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> had worn to a stump She turned aside her head the neck the clear cheek forsaken by their natural veil were seen to flush warm Ah she has not forgotten you see sir said <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> exultant She knows how naughty she was A smile which <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> would not permit to expand made her lip tremble she bent her face and hid it half with her arms half in her curls which as she stooped fell loose again Certainly I was a rebel she answered A rebel repeated <PERSON>Henry Yes</PERSON> you and papa had quarrelled terribly and you set both him and mamma and <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and everybody at defiance You said he had insulted you He _had_ insulted me interposed <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> And you wanted to leave <LOCATION>Sympson Grove</LOCATION> directly You packed your things up and papa threw them out of your trunk mamma cried <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> cried they both stood wringing their hands begging you to be patient and you knelt on the floor with your things and your up turned box before you looking <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> looking why in one of _your_ passions Your features in such passions are not distorted they are fixed but quite beautiful You scarcely look angry only resolute and in a certain haste yet one feels that at such times an obstacle cast across your path would be split as with lightning Papa lost heart and called Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Enough Henry No it is not enough I hardly know how Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> managed except that I recollect he suggested to papa that agitation would bring on his gout and then he spoke quietly to the ladies and got them away and afterwards he said to you Miss <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> that it was of no use talking or lecturing now but that the tea things were just brought into the schoolroom and he was very thirsty and he would be glad if you would leave your packing for the present and come and make a cup of tea for him and me You came you would not talk at first but soon you softened and grew cheerful Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> began to tell us about the Continent the war and <PERSON>Bonaparte</PERSON> subjects we were both fond of listening to After tea he said we should neither of us leave him that evening he would not let us stray out of his sight lest we should again get into mischief We sat one on each side of him We were so happy I never passed so pleasant an evening The next day he gave you missy a lecture of an hour and wound it up by marking you a piece to learn in <LOCATION>Bossuet</LOCATION> as a punishment lesson Le Cheval Dompt You learned it instead of packing up <PERSON>Shirley We</PERSON> heard no more of your running away Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> used to tease you on the subject for a year afterwards She never said a lesson with greater spirit subjoined Moore She then for the first time gave me the treat of hearing my native tongue spoken without accent by an English girl She was as sweet as summer cherries for a month afterwards struck in <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> a good hearty quarrel always left <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s temper better than it found it You talk of me as if I were not present observed Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> who had not yet lifted her face Are you sure you _are_ present asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> There have been moments since my arrival here when I have been tempted to inquire of the lady of <LOCATION>Fieldhead</LOCATION> if she knew what had become of my former pupil She is here now I see her and humble enough but I would neither advise <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> nor others to believe too implicitly in the humility which one moment can hide its blushing face like a modest little child and the next lift it pale and lofty as a marble Juno One man in times of old it is said imparted vitality to the statue he had chiselled others may have the contrary gift of turning life to stone <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> paused on this observation before he replied to it His look at once struck and meditative said A strange phrase what may it mean He turned it over in his mind with thought deep and slow as some German pondering metaphysics You mean he said at last that some men inspire repugnance and so chill the kind heart Ingenious responded <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> If the interpretation pleases you you are welcome to hold it valid _I_ don t care And with that she raised her head lofty in look and statue like in hue as <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> had described it Behold the metamorphosis he said scarce imagined ere it is realized a lowly nymph develops to an inaccessible goddess But <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> must not be disappointed of his recitation and <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> will deign to oblige him Let us begin I have forgotten the very first line Which I have not _My_ memory if a slow is a retentive one I acquire deliberately both knowledge and liking The acquisition grows into my brain and the sentiment into my breast and it is not as the rapid springing produce which having no root in itself flourishes verdurous enough for a time but too soon falls withered away Attention <PERSON>Henry Miss Keeldar</PERSON> consents to favour you <PERSON>Voyez</PERSON> ce cheval ardent et imp tueux so it commences Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> did consent to make the effort but she soon stopped Unless I heard the whole repeated I cannot continue it she said Yet it was quickly learned soon gained soon gone moralized the tutor He recited the passage deliberately accurately with slow impressive emphasis <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> by degrees inclined her ear as he went on Her face before turned from him _re_turned towards him When he ceased she took the word up as if from his lips she took his very tone she seized his very accent she delivered the periods as he had delivered them she reproduced his manner his pronunciation his expression It was now her turn to petition Recall <PERSON>Le Songe</PERSON> d <PERSON>Athalie</PERSON> she entreated and say it He said it for her She took it from him she found lively excitement in the pleasure of making his language her own She asked for further indulgence all the old school pieces were revived and with them <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s old school days He had gone through some of the best passages of <LOCATION>Racine</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Corneille</PERSON> and then had heard the echo of his own deep tones in the girl s voice that modulated itself faithfully on his Le ch ne et le <LOCATION>Roseau</LOCATION> that most beautiful of <PERSON>La Fontaine</PERSON> s fables had been recited well recited by the tutor and the pupil had animatedly availed herself of the lesson Perhaps a simultaneous feeling seized them now that their enthusiasm had kindled to a glow which the slight fuel of French poetry no longer sufficed to feed perhaps they longed for a trunk of English oak to be thrown as a Yule log to the devouring flame <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> observed And these are our best pieces And we have nothing more dramatic nervous natural And then he smiled and was silent His whole nature seemed serenely alight He stood on the hearth leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece musing not unblissfully Twilight was closing on the diminished autumn day The schoolroom windows darkened with creeping plants from which no high October winds had as yet swept the sere foliage admitted scarce a gleam of sky but the fire gave light enough to talk by And now <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> addressed his pupil in French and she answered at first with laughing hesitation and in broken phrase <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> encouraged while he corrected her <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> joined in the lesson the two scholars stood opposite the master their arms round each other s waists Tartar who long since had craved and obtained admission sat sagely in the centre of the rug staring at the blaze which burst fitful from morsels of coal among the red cinders The group were happy enough but Pleasures are like poppies spread You seize the flower its bloom is shed The dull rumbling sound of wheels was heard on the pavement in the yard It is the carriage returned said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and dinner must be just ready and I am not dressed A servant came in with Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s candle and tea for the tutor and his pupil usually dined at luncheon time Mr <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> and the ladies are returned she said and Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> is with them How you did start and how your hand trembled <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> when the maid had closed the shutter and was gone But I know why don t you Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I know what papa intends He is a little ugly man that Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> I wish he had not come I wish sisters and all of them had stayed at <LOCATION>De Walden Hall</LOCATION> to dine <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> should once more have made tea for you and me Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and we would have had a happy evening of it <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was locking up his desk and putting away his <ORGANIZATION>St Pierre That</ORGANIZATION> was _your_ plan was it my boy <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t you approve it sir I approve nothing utopian Look Life in its iron face stare Reality out of its brassy countenance Make the tea <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> I shall be back in a minute He left the room so did <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> by another door CHAPTER XXVIII PH BE <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> probably got on pleasantly with Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> that evening for the next morning she came down in one of her best moods Who will take a walk with me she asked after breakfast <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gertrude</PERSON> will you So rare was such an invitation from Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> to her female cousins that they hesitated before they accepted it Their mamma however signifying acquiescence in the project they fetched their bonnets and the trio set out It did not suit these three young persons to be thrown much together Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> liked the society of few ladies indeed she had a cordial pleasure in that of none except <PERSON>Mrs Pryor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> She was civil kind attentive even to her cousins but still she usually had little to say to them In the sunny mood of this particular morning she contrived to entertain even the Misses Sympson Without deviating from her wonted rule of discussing with them only ordinary themes she imparted to these themes an extraordinary interest the sparkle of her spirit glanced along her phrases What made her so joyous All the cause must have been in herself The day was not bright It was dim a pale waning autumn day The walks through the dun woods were damp the atmosphere was heavy the sky overcast and yet it seemed that in <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s heart lived all the light and azure of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> as all its fervour laughed in her gray English eye Some directions necessary to be given to her foreman <PERSON>John</PERSON> delayed her behind her cousins as they neared <PERSON>Fieldhead</PERSON> on their return Perhaps an interval of twenty minutes elapsed between her separation from them and her re entrance into the house In the meantime she had spoken to <PERSON>John</PERSON> and then she had lingered in the lane at the gate A summons to luncheon called her in She excused herself from the meal and went upstairs Is not <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> coming to luncheon asked <PERSON>Isabella She</PERSON> said she was hungry An hour after as she did not quit her chamber one of her cousins went to seek her there She was found sitting at the foot of the bed her head resting on her hand she looked quite pale very thoughtful almost sad You are not ill was the question put A little sick replied Miss Keeldar Certainly she was not a little changed from what she had been two hours before This change accounted for only by those three words explained no otherwise this change whencesoever springing effected in a brief ten minutes passed like no light summer cloud She talked when she joined her friends at dinner talked as usual She remained with them during the evening When again questioned respecting her health she declared herself perfectly recovered It had been a mere passing faintness a momentary sensation not worth a thought yet it was felt there was a difference in Shirley The next day the day the week the fortnight after this new and peculiar shadow lingered on the countenance in the manner of Miss Keeldar A strange quietude settled over her look her movements her very voice The alteration was not so marked as to court or permit frequent questioning yet it _was_ there and it would not pass away It hung over her like a cloud which no breeze could stir or disperse Soon it became evident that to notice this change was to annoy her First she shrank from remark and if persisted in she with her own peculiar _hauteur_ repelled it Was she ill The reply came with decision I _am not_ Did anything weigh on her mind Had anything happened to affect her spirits She scornfully ridiculed the idea What did they mean by spirits She had no spirits black or white blue or gray to affect Something must be the matter she was so altered She supposed she had a right to alter at her ease She knew she was plainer If it suited her to grow ugly why need others fret themselves on the subject There must be a cause for the change What was it She peremptorily requested to be let alone Then she would make every effort to appear quite gay and she seemed indignant at herself that she could not perfectly succeed Brief self spurning epithets burst from her lips when alone Fool coward she would term herself Poltroon she would say if you must tremble tremble in secret Quail where no eye sees you How dare you she would ask herself how dare you show your weakness and betray your imbecile anxieties Shake them off rise above them If you cannot do this hide them And to hide them she did her best She once more became resolutely lively in company When weary of effort and forced to relax she sought solitude not the solitude of her chamber she refused to mope shut up between four walls but that wilder solitude which lies out of doors and which she could chase mounted on Zo her mare She took long rides of half a day Her uncle disapproved but he dared not remonstrate It was never pleasant to face <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s anger even when she was healthy and gay but now that her face showed thin and her large eye looked hollow there was something in the darkening of that face and kindling of that eye which touched as well as alarmed To all comparative strangers who unconscious of the alterations in her spirits commented on the alteration in her looks she had one reply I am perfectly well I have not an ailment And health indeed she must have had to be able to bear the exposure to the weather she now encountered Wet or fair calm or storm she took her daily ride over <ORGANIZATION>Stilbro Moor Tartar</ORGANIZATION> keeping up at her side with his wolf like gallop long and untiring Twice three times the eyes of gossips those eyes which are everywhere in the closet and on the hill top noticed that instead of turning on Rushedge the top ridge of <LOCATION>Stilbro Moor</LOCATION> she rode forwards all the way to the town Scouts were not wanting to mark her destination there It was ascertained that she alighted at the door of one Mr <PERSON>Pearson Hall</PERSON> a solicitor related to the vicar of Nunnely This gentleman and his ancestors had been the agents of the <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> family for generations back Some people affirmed that Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> was become involved in business speculations connected with Hollow s Mill that she had lost money and was constrained to mortgage her land Others conjectured that she was going to be married and that the settlements were preparing Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry Sympson</PERSON> were together in the schoolroom The tutor was waiting for a lesson which the pupil seemed busy in preparing <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> make haste The afternoon is getting on Is it sir Certainly Are you nearly ready with that lesson No Not _nearly_ ready I have not construed a line Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> looked up The boy s tone was rather peculiar The task presents no difficulties <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> or if it does bring them to me We will work together Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I can do no work My boy you are ill Sir I am not worse in bodily health than usual but my heart is full Shut the book Come hither Harry Come to the fireside <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> limped forward His tutor placed him in a chair his lips were quivering his eyes brimming He laid his crutch on the floor bent down his head and wept This distress is not occasioned by physical pain you say Harry You have a grief tell it me Sir I have such a grief as I never had before I wish it could be relieved in some way I can hardly bear it Who knows but if we talk it over we may relieve it What is the cause Whom does it concern The cause sir is <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> it concerns <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> Does it You think her changed All who know her think her changed you too Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Not seriously no I see no alteration but such as a favourable turn might repair in a few weeks besides her own word must go for something she says she is well There it is sir As long as she maintained she was well I believed her When I was sad out of her sight I soon recovered spirits in her presence Now Well <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> now Has she said anything to you You and she were together in the garden two hours this morning I saw her talking and you listening Now my dear <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> if <PERSON>Miss Keeldar</PERSON> has said she is ill and enjoined you to keep her secret do not obey her For her life s sake avow everything Speak my boy _She_ say she is ill I believe sir if she were dying she would smile and aver Nothing ails me What have you learned then What new circumstance I have learned that she has just made her will Made her will The tutor and pupil were silent She told you that asked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> when some minutes had elapsed She told me quite cheerfully not as an ominous circumstance which I felt it to be She said I was the only person besides her solicitor <PERSON>Pearson Hall</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> and Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> who knew anything about it and to me she intimated she wished specially to explain its provisions Go on Harry Because she said looking down on me with her beautiful eyes oh they _are_ beautiful Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I love them I love her She is my star Heaven must not claim her She is lovely in this world and fitted for this world <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> is not an angel she is a woman and she shall live with men Seraphs shall not have her Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> if one of the sons of God with wings wide and bright as the sky blue and sounding as the sea having seen that she was fair descended to claim her his claim should be withstood withstood by me boy and cripple as I am <PERSON>Henry Sympson</PERSON> go on when I tell you Because she said if I made no will and died before you <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> all my property would go to you and I do not intend that it should be so though your father would like it But you she said will have his whole estate which is large larger than Fieldhead Your sisters will have nothing so I have left them some money though I do not love them both together half so much as I love one lock of your fair hair She said these words and she called me her darling and let me kiss her She went on to tell me that she had left <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> some money too that this manor house with its furniture and books she had bequeathed to me as she did not choose to take the old family place from her own blood and that all the rest of her property amounting to about twelve thousand pounds exclusive of the legacies to my sisters and Miss <PERSON>Helstone</PERSON> she had willed not to me seeing I was already rich but to a good man who would make the best use of it that any human being could do a man she said that was both gentle and brave strong and merciful a man that might not profess to be pious but she knew he had the secret of religion pure and undefiled before God The spirit of love and peace was with him He visited the fatherless and widows in their affliction and kept himself unspotted from the world Then she asked Do you approve what I have done <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> I could not answer My tears choked me as they do now Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> allowed his pupil a moment to contend with and master his emotion He then demanded What else did she say When I had signified my full consent to the conditions of her will she told me I was a generous boy and she was proud of me And now she added in case anything should happen you will know what to say to <LOCATION>Malice</LOCATION> when she comes whispering hard things in your ear insinuating that <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> has wronged you that she did not love you You will know that I _did_ love you <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> that no sister could have loved you better my own treasure Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> sir when I remember her voice and recall her look my heart beats as if it would break its strings She _may_ go to heaven before me if God commands it she _must_ but the rest of my life and my life will not be long I am glad of that now shall be a straight quick thoughtful journey in the path her step has pressed I thought to enter the vault of the Keeldars before her Should it be otherwise lay my coffin by <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s side <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> answered him with a weighty calm that offered a strange contrast to the boy s perturbed enthusiasm You are wrong both of you you harm each other If youth once falls under the influence of a shadowy terror it imagines there will never be full sunlight again its first calamity it fancies will last a lifetime What more did she say Anything more We settled one or two family points between ourselves I should rather like to know what But Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> you smile _I_ could not smile to see <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> in such a mood My boy I am neither nervous nor poetic nor inexperienced I see things as they are you don t as yet Tell me these family points Only sir she asked me whether I considered myself most of a Keeldar or a Sympson and I answered I was <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> to the core of the heart and to the marrow of the bones She said she was glad of it for besides her I was the only <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> left in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> And then we agreed on some matters Well Well sir that if I lived to inherit my father s estate and her house I was to take the name of <LOCATION>Keeldar</LOCATION> and to make Fieldhead my residence <PERSON>Henry Shirley Keeldar</PERSON> I said I would be called and I will Her name and her manor house are ages old and <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Sympson Grove</LOCATION> are of yesterday Come you are neither of you going to heaven yet I have the best hopes of you both with your proud distinctions a pair of half fledged eaglets Now what is your inference from all you have told me Put it into words That <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> thinks she is going to die She referred to her health Not once but I assure you she is wasting Her hands are grown quite thin and so is her cheek Does she ever complain to your mother or sisters Never She laughs at them when they question her Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> she is a strange being so fair and girlish not a man like woman at all not an <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> and yet lifting her head above both help and sympathy Do you know where she is now <PERSON>Henry Is</PERSON> she in the house or riding out Surely not out sir It rains fast True which however is no guarantee that she is not at this moment cantering over Rushedge Of late she has never permitted weather to be a hindrance to her rides You remember Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> how wet and stormy it was last Wednesday so wild indeed that she would not permit Zo to be saddled Yet the blast she thought too tempestuous for her mare she herself faced on foot that afternoon she walked nearly as far as Nunnely I asked her when she came in if she was not afraid of taking cold Not I she said It would be too much good luck for me I don t know <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> but the best thing that could happen to me would be to take a good cold and fever and so pass off like other Christians She is reckless you see sir Reckless indeed Go and find out where she is and if you can get an opportunity of speaking to her without attracting attention request her to come here a minute Yes sir He snatched his crutch and started up to go Harry He returned Do not deliver the message formally Word it as in former days you would have worded an ordinary summons to the schoolroom I see sir She will be more likely to obey And Harry Sir I will call you when I want you Till then you are dispensed from lessons He departed Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> left alone rose from his desk I can be very cool and very supercilious with <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> he said I can seem to make light of his apprehensions and look down _du haut de ma grandeur_ on his youthful ardour To _him_ I can speak as if in my eyes they were both children Let me see if I can keep up the same r le with her I have known the moment when I seemed about to forget it when Confusion and Submission seemed about to crush me with their soft tyranny when my tongue faltered and I have almost let the mantle drop and stood in her presence not master no but something else I trust I shall never so play the fool It is well for a Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> to redden when he meets her eye He may permit himself the indulgence of submission He may even without disgrace suffer his hand to tremble when it touches hers but if one of her farmers were to show himself susceptible and sentimental he would merely prove his need of a strait waistcoat So far I have always done very well She has sat near me and I have not shaken more than my desk I have encountered her looks and smiles like why like a tutor as I am Her hand I never yet touched never underwent that test Her farmer or her footman I am not no serf nor servant of hers have I ever been but I am poor and it behoves me to look to my self respect not to compromise an inch of it What did she mean by that allusion to the cold people who petrify flesh to marble It pleased me I hardly know why I would not permit myself to inquire I never do indulge in scrutiny either of her language or countenance for if I did I should sometimes forget common sense and believe in romance A strange secret ecstasy steals through my veins at moments I ll not encourage I ll not remember it I am resolved as long as may be to retain the right to say with <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> I am not mad but speak forth the words of truth and soberness He paused listening Will she come or will she not come he inquired How will she take the message Na vely or disdainfully Like a child or like a queen Both characters are in her nature If she comes what shall I say to her How account firstly for the freedom of the request Shall I apologize to her I could in all humility but would an apology tend to place us in the positions we ought relatively to occupy in this matter I _must_ keep up the professor otherwise I hear a door He waited Many minutes passed She will refuse me <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> is entreating her to come she declines My petition is presumption in her eyes Let her _only_ come I can teach her to the contrary I would rather she were a little perverse it will steel me I prefer her cuirassed in pride armed with a taunt Her scorn startles me from my dreams I stand up myself A sarcasm from her eyes or lips puts strength into every nerve and sinew I have Some step approaches and not <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> s The door unclosed Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> came in The message it appeared had found her at her needle she brought her work in her hand That day she had not been riding out she had evidently passed it quietly She wore her neat indoor dress and silk apron This was no Thalestris from the fields but a quiet domestic character from the fireside Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> had her at advantage He should have addressed her at once in solemn accents and with rigid mien Perhaps he would had she looked saucy but her air never showed less of _cr nerie_ A soft kind of youthful shyness depressed her eyelid and mantled on her cheek The tutor stood silent She made a full stop between the door and his desk Did you want me sir she asked I ventured Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> to send for you that is to ask an interview of a few minutes She waited she plied her needle Well sir not lifting her eyes what about Be seated first The subject I would broach is one of some moment Perhaps I have hardly a right to approach it It is possible I ought to frame an apology it is possible no apology can excuse me The liberty I have taken arises from a conversation with <PERSON>Henry The</PERSON> boy is unhappy about your health all your friends are unhappy on that subject It is of your health I would speak I am quite well she said briefly Yet changed That matters to none but myself We all change Will you sit down Formerly Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> I had some influence with you have I any now May I feel that what I am saying is not accounted positive presumption Let me read some French Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> or I will even take a spell at the Latin grammar and let us proclaim a truce to all sanitary discussions No no It is time there were discussions Discuss away then but do not choose me for your text I am a healthy subject Do you not think it wrong to affirm and reaffirm what is substantially untrue I say I am well I have neither cough pain nor fever Is there no equivocation in that assertion Is it the direct truth The direct truth <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> looked at her earnestly I can myself he said trace no indications of actual disease But why then are you altered _Am_ I altered We will try We will seek a proof How I ask in the first place do you sleep as you used to I do not but it is not because I am ill Have you the appetite you once had No but it is not because I am ill You remember this little ring fastened to my watch chain It was my mother s and is too small to pass the joint of my little finger You have many a time sportively purloined it It fitted your fore finger Try now She permitted the test The ring dropped from the wasted little hand <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> picked it up and reattached it to the chain An uneasy flush coloured his brow <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> again said It is not because I am ill Not only have you lost sleep appetite and flesh proceeded <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> but your spirits are always at ebb Besides there is a nervous alarm in your eye a nervous disquiet in your manner These peculiarities were not formerly yours Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> we will pause here You have exactly hit it I am nervous Now talk of something else What wet weather we have steady pouring rain _You_ nervous Yes and if <PERSON>Miss Keeldar</PERSON> is nervous it is not without a cause Let me reach it Let me look nearer The ailment is not physical I have suspected that It came in one moment I know the day I noticed the change Your pain is mental Not at all It is nothing so dignified merely nervous Oh dismiss the topic When it is exhausted not till then Nervous alarms should always be communicated that they may be dissipated I wish I had the gift of persuasion and could incline you to speak willingly I believe confession in your case would be half equivalent to cure No said <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> abruptly I wish that were at all probable but I am afraid it is not She suspended her work a moment She was now seated Resting her elbow on the table she leaned her head on her hand Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> looked as if he felt he had at last gained some footing in this difficult path She was serious and in her wish was implied an important admission after that she could no longer affirm that _nothing_ ailed her The tutor allowed her some minutes for repose and reflection ere he returned to the charge Once his lips moved to speak but he thought better of it and prolonged the pause <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> lifted her eye to his Had he betrayed injudicious emotion perhaps obstinate persistence in silence would have been the result but he looked calm strong trustworthy I had better tell _you_ than my aunt she said or than my cousins or my uncle They would all make such a bustle and it is that very bustle I dread the alarm the flurry the _ clat_ In short I never liked to be the centre of a small domestic whirlpool You can bear a little shock eh A great one if necessary Not a muscle of the man s frame moved and yet his large heart beat fast in his deep chest What was she going to tell him Was irremediable mischief done Had I thought it right to go to you I would never have made a secret of the matter one moment she continued I would have told you at once and asked advice Why was it not right to come to me It might be _right_ I do not mean that but I could not do it I seemed to have no title to trouble you The mishap concerned me only I wanted to keep it to myself and people will not let me I tell you I hate to be an object of worrying attention or a theme for village gossip Besides it may pass away without result God knows <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> though tortured with suspense did not demand a quick explanation He suffered neither gesture glance nor word to betray impatience His tranquillity tranquillized <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> his confidence reassured her Great effects may spring from trivial causes she remarked as she loosened a bracelet from her wrist Then unfastening her sleeve and partially turning it up Look here Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> She showed a mark in her white arm rather a deep though healed up indentation something between a burn and a cut I would not show that to any one in <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> but you because you can take it quietly Certainly there is nothing in the little mark to shock Its history will explain Small as it is it has taken my sleep away and made me nervous thin and foolish because on account of that little mark I am obliged to look forward to a possibility that has its terrors The sleeve was readjusted the bracelet replaced Do you know that you try me he said smiling I am a patient sort of man but my pulse is quickening Whatever happens you will befriend me Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> You will give me the benefit of your self possession and not leave me at the mercy of agitated cowards I make no promise now Tell me the tale and then exact what pledge you will It is a very short tale I took a walk with <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gertrude</PERSON> one day about three weeks ago They reached home before me I stayed behind to speak to <PERSON>John After</PERSON> leaving him I pleased myself with lingering in the lane where all was very still and shady I was tired of chattering to the girls and in no hurry to rejoin them As I stood leaning against the gate pillar thinking some very happy thoughts about my future life for that morning I imagined that events were beginning to turn as I had long wished them to turn Ah Nunnely had been with her the evening before thought <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> parenthetically I heard a panting sound a dog came running up the lane I know most of the dogs in this neighbourhood It was Ph be one of Mr <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> s pointers The poor creature ran with her head down her tongue hanging out she looked as if bruised and beaten all over I called her I meant to coax her into the house and give her some water and dinner I felt sure she had been ill used Mr <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> often flogs his pointers cruelly She was too flurried to know me and when I attempted to pat her head she turned and snatched at my arm She bit it so as to draw blood then ran panting on Directly after Mr <PERSON>Wynne</PERSON> s keeper came up carrying a gun He asked if I had seen a dog I told him I had seen Ph be You had better chain up Tartar ma am he said and tell your people to keep within the house I am after Ph be to shoot her and the groom is gone another way She is raging mad Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> resumed her square of silk canvas and continued the creation of a wreath of Parmese violets And you told no one sought no help no cure You would not come to me I got as far as the schoolroom door there my courage failed I preferred to cushion the matter Why What can I demand better in this world than to be of use to you I had no claim Monstrous And you did nothing Yes I walked straight into the laundry where they are ironing most of the week now that I have so many guests in the house While the maid was busy crimping or starching I took an Italian iron from the fire and applied the light scarlet glowing tip to my arm I bored it well in It cauterized the little wound Then I went upstairs I dare say you never once groaned I am sure I don t know I was very miserable not firm or tranquil at all I think There was no calm in my mind There was calm in your person I remember listening the whole time we sat at luncheon to hear if you moved in the room above All was quiet I was sitting at the foot of the bed wishing Ph be had not bitten me And alone You like solitude Pardon me You disdain sympathy Do I Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> With your powerful mind you must feel independent of help of advice of society So be it since it pleases you She smiled She pursued her embroidery carefully and quickly but her eyelash twinkled and then it glittered and then a drop fell Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> leaned forward on his desk moved his chair altered his attitude If it is not so he asked with a peculiar mellow change in his voice how is it then I don t know You do know but you won t speak All must be locked up in yourself Because it is not worth sharing Because nobody can give the high price you require for your confidence Nobody is rich enough to purchase it Nobody has the honour the intellect the power you demand in your adviser There is not a shoulder in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> on which you would rest your hand for support far less a bosom which you would permit to pillow your head Of course you must live alone I _can_ live alone if need be But the question is not how to live but how to die alone That strikes me in a more grisly light You apprehend the effects of the virus You anticipate an indefinitely threatening dreadful doom She bowed You are very nervous and womanish You complimented me two minutes since on my powerful mind You are very womanish If the whole affair were coolly examined and discussed I feel assured it would turn out that there is no danger of your dying at all Amen I am very willing to live if it please God I have felt life sweet How can it be otherwise than sweet with your endowments and nature Do you truly expect that you will be seized with hydrophobia and die raving mad I _expect_ it and have _feared_ it Just now I fear nothing Nor do I on your account I doubt whether the smallest particle of virus mingled with your blood and if it did let me assure you that young healthy faultlessly sound as you are no harm will ensue For the rest I shall inquire whether the dog was really mad I hold she was not mad Tell nobody that she bit me Why should I when I believe the bite innocuous as a cut of this penknife Make yourself easy _I_ am easy though I value your life as much as I do my own chance of happiness in eternity Look up Why Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> I wish to see if you are cheered Put your work down raise your head There Look at me Thank you And is the cloud broken I fear nothing Is your mind restored to its own natural sunny clime I am very content but I want your promise Dictate You know in case the worst I _have_ feared should happen they will smother me You need not smile They will they always do My uncle will be full of horror weakness precipitation and that is the only expedient which will suggest itself to him Nobody in the house will be self possessed but you Now promise to befriend me to keep Mr <PERSON>Sympson</PERSON> away from me not to let <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> come near lest I should hurt him Mind _mind_ that you take care of yourself too But I shall not injure you I know I shall not Lock the chamber door against the surgeons turn them out if they get in Let neither the young nor the old MacTurk lay a finger on me nor Mr <PERSON>Greaves</PERSON> their colleague and lastly if I give trouble with your own hand administer to me a strong narcotic such a sure dose of laudanum as shall leave no mistake _Promise to do this _ <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> left his desk and permitted himself the recreation of one or two turns through the room Stopping behind <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> s chair he bent over her and said in a low emphatic voice I promise all you ask without comment without reservation If female help is needed call in my housekeeper <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> Let her lay me out if I die She is attached to me She wronged me again and again and again and again I forgave her She now loves me and would not defraud me of a pin Confidence has made her honest forbearance has made her kind hearted At this day I can trust both her integrity her courage and her affection Call her but keep my good aunt and my timid cousins away Once more promise I promise That is good in you she said looking up at him as he bent over her and smiling Is it good Does it comfort Very much I will be with you I and <PERSON>Mrs Gill</PERSON> only in any in every extremity where calm and fidelity are needed No rash or coward hand shall meddle Yet you think me childish I do Ah you despise me Do we despise children In fact I am neither so strong nor have I such pride in my strength as people think Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> nor am I so regardless of sympathy But when I have any grief I fear to impart it to those I love lest it should pain them and to those whom I view with indifference I cannot condescend to complain After all you should not taunt me with being childish for if you were as unhappy as I have been for the last three weeks you too would want some friend We all want a friend do we not All of us that have anything good in our natures Well you have <PERSON>Caroline Helstone</PERSON> Yes And you have Mr <PERSON>Hall Yes Mrs Pryor</PERSON> is a wise good woman She can counsel you when you need counsel For your part you have your brother <PERSON>Robert For</PERSON> any right hand defections there is the Rev Matthewson Helstone M A to lean upon for any left hand fallings off there is <PERSON>Hiram Yorke Esq</PERSON> Both elders pay you homage I never saw <PERSON>Mrs Yorke</PERSON> so motherly to any young man as she is to you I don t know how you have won her heart but she is more tender to you than she is to her own sons You have besides your sister <PERSON>Hortense</PERSON> It appears we are both well provided It appears so How thankful we ought to be Yes How contented Yes For my part I am almost contented just now and very thankful Gratitude is a divine emotion It fills the heart but not to bursting it warms it but not to fever I like to taste leisurely of bliss Devoured in haste I do not know its flavour Still leaning on the back of Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s chair <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> watched the rapid motion of her fingers as the green and purple garland grew beneath them After a prolonged pause he again asked Is the shadow _quite_ gone Wholly As I _was_ two hours since and as I _am_ now are two different states of existence I believe Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> griefs and fears nursed in silence grow like Titan infants You will cherish such feelings no more in silence Not if I dare speak In using the word _dare_ to whom do you allude To you How is it applicable to me On account of your austerity and shyness Why am I austere and shy Because you are proud Why am I proud I should like to know Will you be good enough to tell me Perhaps because I am poor for one reason Poverty and pride often go together That is such a nice reason I should be charmed to discover another that would pair with it Mate that turtle Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> Immediately What do you think of marrying to sober Poverty many tinted Caprice Are you capricious _You_ are A libel I am steady as a rock fixed as the polar star I look out at some early hour of the day and see a fine perfect rainbow bright with promise gloriously spanning the beclouded welkin of life An hour afterwards I look again half the arch is gone and the rest is faded Still later the stern sky denies that it ever wore so benign a symbol of hope Well Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> you should contend against these changeful humours They are your besetting sin One never knows where to have you Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> I had once for two years a pupil who grew very dear to me <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> is dear but she was dearer <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> never gives me trouble she well she did I think she vexed me twenty three hours out of the twenty four She was never with you above three hours or at the most six at a time She sometimes spilled the draught from my cup and stole the food from my plate and when she had kept me unfed for a day and that did not suit me for I am a man accustomed to take my meals with reasonable relish and to ascribe due importance to the rational enjoyment of creature comforts I know you do I can tell what sort of dinners you like best perfectly well I know precisely the dishes you prefer She robbed these dishes of flavour and made a fool of me besides I like to sleep well In my quiet days when I was my own man I never quarrelled with the night for being long nor cursed my bed for its thorns She changed all this Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> And having taken from me peace of mind and ease of life she took from me herself quite coolly just as if when she was gone the world would be all the same to me I knew I should see her again at some time At the end of two years it fell out that we encountered again under her own roof where she was mistress How do you think she bore herself towards me Miss Keeldar Like one who had profited well by lessons learned from yourself She received me haughtily She meted out a wide space between us and kept me aloof by the reserved gesture the rare and alienated glance the word calmly civil She was an excellent pupil Having seen you distant she at once learned to withdraw Pray sir admire in her _hauteur_ a careful improvement on your own coolness Conscience and honour and the most despotic necessity dragged me apart from her and kept me sundered with ponderous fetters She was free she might have been clement Never free to compromise her self respect to seek where she had been shunned Then she was inconsistent she tantalized as before When I thought I had made up my mind to seeing in her only a lofty stranger she would suddenly show me such a glimpse of loving simplicity she would warm me with such a beam of reviving sympathy she would gladden an hour with converse so gentle gay and kindly that I could no more shut my heart on her image than I could close that door against her presence Explain why she distressed me so She could not bear to be quite outcast and then she would sometimes get a notion into her head on a cold wet day that the schoolroom was no cheerful place and feel it incumbent on her to go and see if you and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> kept up a good fire and once there she liked to stay But she should not be changeful If she came at all she should come oftener There is such a thing as intrusion To morrow you will not be as you are to day I don t know Will you I am not mad most noble <PERSON>Berenice</PERSON> We may give one day to dreaming but the next we must awake and I shall awake to purpose the morning you are married to Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> The fire shines on you and me and shows us very clearly in the glass Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> and I have been gazing on the picture all the time I have been talking Look up What a difference between your head and mine I look old for thirty You are so grave you have such a square brow and your face is sallow I never regard you as a young man nor as <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s junior <PERSON>Don</PERSON> t you I thought not Imagine <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> s clear cut handsome face looking over my shoulder Does not the apparition make vividly manifest the obtuse mould of my heavy traits There he started I have been expecting that wire to vibrate this last half hour The dinner bell rang and <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> rose Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> she said as she gathered up her silks have you heard from your brother lately Do you know what he means by staying in town so long Does he talk of returning He talks of returning but what has caused his long absence I cannot tell To speak the truth I thought none in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> knew better than yourself why he was reluctant to come home A crimson shadow passed across Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> s cheek Write to him and urge him to come she said I know there has been no impolicy in protracting his absence thus far It is good to let the mill stand while trade is so bad but he must not abandon the county I am aware said <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> that he had an interview with you the evening before he left and I saw him quit Fieldhead afterwards I read his countenance or _tried_ to read it He turned from me I divined that he would be long away Some fine slight fingers have a wondrous knack at pulverizing a man s brittle pride I suppose <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> put too much trust in his manly beauty and native gentlemanhood Those are better off who being destitute of advantage cannot cherish delusion But I will write and say you advise his return Do not say _I_ advise his return but that his return is advisable The second bell rang and Miss <PERSON>Keeldar</PERSON> obeyed its call CHAPTER XXIX <PERSON>LOUIS MOORE Louis Moore</PERSON> was used to a quiet life Being a quiet man he endured it better than most men would Having a large world of his own in his own head and heart he tolerated confinement to a small still corner of the real world very patiently How hushed is Fieldhead this evening All but <PERSON>Moore Miss Keeldar</PERSON> the whole family of the Sympsons even <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> are gone to Nunnely Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> would have them come he wished to make them acquainted with his mother and sisters who are now at the priory Kind gentleman as the baronet is he asked the tutor too but the tutor would much sooner have made an appointment with the ghost of the <PERSON>Earl of Huntingdon</PERSON> to meet him and a shadowy ring of his merry men under the canopy of the thickest blackest oldest oak in Nunnely Forest Yes he would rather have appointed tryst with a phantom abbess or mist pale nun among the wet and weedy relics of that ruined sanctuary of theirs mouldering in the core of the wood <PERSON>Louis Moore</PERSON> longs to have something near him to night but not the boy baronet nor his benevolent but stern mother nor his patrician sisters nor one soul of the Sympsons This night is not calm the equinox still struggles in its storms The wild rains of the day are abated the great single cloud disparts and rolls away from heaven not passing and leaving a sea all sapphire but tossed buoyant before a continued long sounding high rushing moonlight tempest The moon reigns glorious glad of the gale as glad as if she gave herself to his fierce caress with love No Endymion will watch for his goddess to night There are no flocks out on the mountains and it is well for to night she welcomes olus <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> sitting in the schoolroom heard the storm roar round the other gable and along the hall front This end was sheltered He wanted no shelter he desired no subdued sounds or screened position All the parlours are empty said he I am sick at heart of this cell He left it and went where the casements larger and freer than the branch screened lattice of his own apartment admitted unimpeded the dark blue the silver fleeced the stirring and sweeping vision of the autumn night sky He carried no candle unneeded was lamp or fire The broad and clear though cloud crossed and fluctuating beam of the moon shone on every floor and wall <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> wanders through all the rooms He seems following a phantom from parlour to parlour In the oak room he stops This is not chill and polished and fireless like the _salon_ The hearth is hot and ruddy the cinders tinkle in the intense heat of their clear glow near the rug is a little work table a desk upon it a chair near it Does the vision <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> has tracked occupy that chair You would think so could you see him standing before it There is as much interest now in his eye and as much significance in his face as if in this household solitude he had found a living companion and was going to speak to it He makes discoveries A bag a small satin bag hangs on the chair back The desk is open the keys are in the lock A pretty seal a silver pen a crimson berry or two of ripe fruit on a green leaf a small clean delicate glove these trifles at once decorate and disarrange the stand they strew Order forbids details in a picture she puts them tidily away but details give charm <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> spoke Her mark he said Here she has been careless attractive thing called away in haste doubtless and forgetting to return and put all to rights Why does she leave fascination in her footprints Whence did she acquire the gift to be heedless and never offend There is always something to chide in her and the reprimand never settles in displeasure on the heart but for her lover or her husband when it had trickled a while in words would naturally melt from his lips in a kiss Better pass half an hour in remonstrating with her than a day in admiring or praising any other woman alive Am I muttering soliloquizing Stop that He did stop it He stood thinking and then he made an arrangement for his evening s comfort He dropped the curtains over the broad window and regal moon He shut out sovereign and court and starry armies he added fuel to the hot but fast wasting fire he lit a candle of which there were a pair on the table he placed another chair opposite that near the workstand and then he sat down His next movement was to take from his pocket a small thick book of blank paper to produce a pencil and to begin to write in a cramp compact hand Come near by all means reader Do not be shy <PERSON>Stoop</PERSON> over his shoulder fearlessly and read as he scribbles It is nine o clock the carriage will not return before eleven I am certain Freedom is mine till then till then I may occupy her room sit opposite her chair rest my elbow on her table have her little mementoes about me I used rather to like Solitude to fancy her a somewhat quiet and serious yet fair nymph an Oread descending to me from lone mountain passes something of the blue mist of hills in her array and of their chill breeze in her breath but much also of their solemn beauty in her mien I once could court her serenely and imagine my heart easier when I held her to it all mute but majestic Since that day I called S to me in the schoolroom and she came and sat so near my side since she opened the trouble of her mind to me asked my protection appealed to my strength since that hour I abhor Solitude Cold abstraction fleshless skeleton daughter mother and mate of Death It is pleasant to write about what is near and dear as the core of my heart None can deprive me of this little book and through this pencil I can say to it what I will say what I dare utter to nothing living say what I dare not _think_ aloud We have scarcely encountered each other since that evening Once when I was alone in the drawing room seeking a book of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> s she entered dressed for a concert at Stilbro Shyness _her_ shyness not mine drew a silver veil between us Much cant have I heard and read about maiden modesty but properly used and not hackneyed the words are good and appropriate words As she passed to the window after tacitly but gracefully recognizing me I could call her nothing in my own mind save stainless virgin To my perception a delicate splendour robed her and the modesty of girlhood was her halo I may be the most fatuous as I am one of the plainest of men but in truth that shyness of hers touched me exquisitely it flattered my finest sensations I looked a stupid block I dare say I was alive with a life of Paradise as she turned _her_ glance from _my_ glance and softly averted her head to hide the suffusion of her cheek I know this is the talk of a dreamer of a rapt romantic lunatic I _do_ dream I _will_ dream now and then and if she has inspired romance into my prosaic composition how can I help it What a child she is sometimes What an unsophisticated untaught thing I see her now looking up into my face and entreating me to prevent them from smothering her and to be sure and give her a strong narcotic I see her confessing that she was not so self sufficing so independent of sympathy as people thought I see the secret tear drop quietly from her eyelash She said I thought her childish and I did She imagined I despised her Despised her It was unutterably sweet to feel myself at once near her and above her to be conscious of a natural right and power to sustain her as a husband should sustain his wife I worship her perfections but it is her faults or at least her foibles that bring her near to me that nestle her to my heart that fold her about with my love and that for a most selfish but deeply natural reason These faults are the steps by which I mount to ascendency over her If she rose a trimmed artificial mound without inequality what vantage would she offer the foot It is the natural hill with its mossy breaks and hollows whose slope invites ascent whose summit it is pleasure to gain To leave metaphor It delights my eye to look on her She suits me If I were a king and she the housemaid that swept my palace stairs across all that space between us my eye would recognize her qualities a true pulse would beat for her in my heart though an unspanned gulf made acquaintance impossible If I were a gentleman and she waited on me as a servant I could not help liking that <PERSON>Shirley Take</PERSON> from her her education take her ornaments her sumptuous dress all extrinsic advantages take all grace but such as the symmetry of her form renders inevitable present her to me at a cottage door in a stuff gown let her offer me there a draught of water with that smile with that warm good will with which she now dispenses manorial hospitality I should like her I should wish to stay an hour I should linger to talk with that rustic I should not feel as I _now_ do I should find in her nothing divine but whenever I met the young peasant it would be with pleasure whenever I left her it would be with regret How culpably careless in her to leave her desk open where I know she has money In the lock hang the keys of all her repositories of her very jewel casket There is a purse in that little satin bag I see the tassel of silver beads hanging out That spectacle would provoke my brother <PERSON>Robert All</PERSON> her little failings would I know be a source of irritation to him If they vex me it is a most pleasurable vexation I delight to find her at fault and were I always resident with her I am aware she would be no niggard in thus ministering to my enjoyment She would just give me something to do to rectify a theme for my tutor lectures I never lecture <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> never feel disposed to do so If he does wrong and that is very seldom dear excellent lad a word suffices Often I do no more than shake my head But the moment her _minois mutin_ meets my eye expostulatory words crowd to my lips From a taciturn man I believe she would transform me into a talker Whence comes the delight I take in that talk It puzzles myself sometimes The more _cr ne malin taquin_ is her mood consequently the clearer occasion she gives me for disapprobation the more I seek her the better I like her She is never wilder than when equipped in her habit and hat never less manageable than when she and Zo come in fiery from a race with the wind on the hills and I confess it to this mute page I may confess it I have waited an hour in the court for the chance of witnessing her return and for the dearer chance of receiving her in my arms from the saddle I have noticed again it is to this page only I would make the remark that she will never permit any man but myself to render her that assistance I have seen her politely decline Sir <PERSON>Philip Nunnely</PERSON> s aid She is always mighty gentle with her young baronet mighty tender for his feelings forsooth and of his very thin skinned _amour propre_ I have marked her haughtily reject <PERSON>Sam Wynne</PERSON> s Now I know my heart knows it for it has felt it that she resigns herself to me unreluctantly Is she conscious how my strength rejoices to serve her I myself am not her slave I declare it but my faculties gather to her beauty like the genii to the glisten of the lamp All my knowledge all my prudence all my calm and all my power stand in her presence humbly waiting a task How glad they are when a mandate comes What joy they take in the toils she assigns Does she know it I have called her careless It is remarkable that her carelessness never compromises her refinement Indeed through this very loophole of character the reality depth genuineness of that refinement may be ascertained A whole garment sometimes covers meagreness and malformation through a rent sleeve a fair round arm may be revealed I have seen and handled many of her possessions because they are frequently astray I never saw anything that did not proclaim the lady nothing sordid nothing soiled In one sense she is as scrupulous as in another she is unthinking As a peasant girl she would go ever trim and cleanly Look at the pure kid of this little glove at the fresh unsullied satin of the bag What a difference there is between S and that pearl C H <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> I fancy is the soul of conscientious punctuality and nice exactitude She would precisely suit the domestic habits of a certain fastidious kinsman of mine so delicate dexterous quaint quick quiet all done to a minute all arranged to a strawbreadth She would suit <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> But what could _I_ do with anything so nearly faultless _She_ is my equal poor as myself She is certainly pretty a little <PERSON>Raffaelle</PERSON> head hers <PERSON>Raffaelle</PERSON> in feature quite English in expression all insular grace and purity but where is there anything to alter anything to endure anything to reprimand to be anxious about There she is a lily of the valley untinted needing no tint What change could improve her What pencil dare to paint _My_ sweetheart if I ever have one must bear nearer affinity to the rose a sweet lively delight guarded with prickly peril _My_ wife if I ever marry must stir my great frame with a sting now and then she must furnish use to her husband s vast mass of patience I was not made so enduring to be mated with a lamb I should find more congenial responsibility in the charge of a young lioness or leopardess I like few things sweet but what are likewise pungent few things bright but what are likewise hot I like the summer day whose sun makes fruit blush and corn blanch Beauty is never so beautiful as when if I tease it it wreathes back on me with spirit Fascination is never so imperial as when roused and half ireful she threatens transformation to fierceness I fear I should tire of the mute monotonous innocence of the lamb I should ere long feel as burdensome the nestling dove which never stirred in my bosom but my patience would exult in stilling the flutterings and training the energies of the restless merlin In managing the wild instincts of the scarce manageable _b te fauve_ my powers would revel O my pupil <PERSON>O Peri</PERSON> too mutinous for heaven too innocent for hell never shall I do more than see and worship and wish for thee Alas knowing I could make thee happy will it be my doom to see thee possessed by those who have not that power However kindly the hand if it is feeble it cannot bend <PERSON>Shirley</PERSON> and she must be bent It cannot curb her and she must be curbed Beware Sir Philip Nunnely I never see you walking or sitting at her side and observe her lips compressed or her brow knit in resolute endurance of some trait of your character which she neither admires nor likes in determined toleration of some weakness she believes atoned for by a virtue but which annoys her despite that belief I never mark the grave glow of her face the unsmiling sparkle of her eye the slight recoil of her whole frame when you draw a little too near and gaze a little too expressively and whisper a little too warmly I never witness these things but I think of the fable of Semele reversed It is not the daughter of Cadmus I see nor do I realize her fatal longing to look on <PERSON>Jove</PERSON> in the majesty of his god head It is a priest of Juno that stands before me watching late and lone at a shrine in an Argive temple For years of solitary ministry he has lived on dreams There is divine madness upon him He loves the idol he serves and prays day and night that his frenzy may be fed and that the Ox eyed may smile on her votary She has heard she will be propitious All Argos slumbers The doors of the temple are shut the priest waits at the altar A shock of heaven and earth is felt not by the slumbering city only by that lonely watcher brave and unshaken in his fanaticism In the midst of silence with no preluding sound he is wrapped in sudden light Through the roof through the rent wide yawning vast white blazing blue of heaven above pours a wondrous descent dread as the downrushing of stars He has what he asked Withdraw forbear to look I am blinded I hear in that fane an unspeakable sound Would that I could not hear it I see an insufferable glory burning terribly between the pillars Gods be merciful and quench it A pious Argive enters to make an early offering in the cool dawn of morning There was thunder in the night the bolt fell here The shrine is shivered the marble pavement round split and blackened Saturnia s statue rises chaste grand untouched at her feet piled ashes lie pale No priest remains he who watched will be seen no more There is the carriage Let me lock up the desk and pocket the keys She will be seeking them to morrow she will have to come to me I hear her Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> have you seen my keys So she will say in her clear voice speaking with reluctance looking ashamed conscious that this is the twentieth time of asking I will tantalize her keep her with me expecting doubting and when I _do_ restore them it shall not be without a lecture Here is the bag too and the purse the glove pen seal She shall wring them all out of me slowly and separately only by confession penitence entreaty I never can touch her hand or a ringlet of her head or a ribbon of her dress but I will make privileges for myself Every feature of her face her bright eyes her lips shall go through each change they know for my pleasure display each exquisite variety of glance and curve to delight thrill perhaps more hopelessly to enchain me If I must be her slave I will not lose my freedom for nothing He locked the desk pocketed all the property and went CHAPTER XXX RUSHEDGE A CONFESSIONAL Everybody said it was high time for Mr <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> to return home All <PERSON>Briarfield</PERSON> wondered at his strange absence and <LOCATION>Whinbury</LOCATION> and Nunnely brought each its separate contribution of amazement Was it known why he stayed away Yes It was known twenty forty times over there being at least forty plausible reasons adduced to account for the unaccountable circumstance Business it was not _that_ the gossips agreed He had achieved the business on which he departed long ago His four ringleaders he had soon scented out and run down He had attended their trial heard their conviction and sentence and seen them safely shipped prior to transportation This was known at <LOCATION>Briarfield</LOCATION> The newspapers had reported it The _<PERSON>Stilbro Courier</PERSON>_ had given every particular with amplifications None applauded his perseverance or hailed his success though the mill owners were glad of it trusting that the terrors of law vindicated would henceforward paralyze the sinister valour of disaffection Disaffection however was still heard muttering to himself He swore ominous oaths over the drugged beer of alehouses and drank strange toasts in fiery British gin One report affirmed that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> _dared_ not come to <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> he knew his life was not worth an hour s purchase if he did I ll tell him that said Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> when his foreman mentioned the rumour and if _that_ does not bring him home full gallop nothing will Either that or some other motive prevailed at last to recall him He announced to <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> the day he should arrive at Stilbro desiring his hackney to be sent to the <PERSON>George</PERSON> for his accommodation and <PERSON>Joe Scott</PERSON> having informed Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> that gentleman made it in his way to meet him It was market day <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> arrived in time to take his usual place at the market dinner As something of a stranger and as a man of note and action the assembled manufacturers received him with a certain distinction Some who in public would scarcely have dared to acknowledge his acquaintance lest a little of the hate and vengeance laid up in store for him should perchance have fallen on them in private hailed him as in some sort their champion When the wine had circulated their respect would have kindled to enthusiasm had not <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> s unshaken nonchalance held it in a damp low smouldering state Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> the permanent president of these dinners witnessed his young friend s bearing with exceeding complacency If one thing could stir his temper or excite his contempt more than another it was to see a man befooled by flattery or elate with popularity If one thing smoothed soothed and charmed him especially it was the spectacle of a public character incapable of relishing his publicity _incapable_ I say Disdain would but have incensed it was indifference that appeased his rough spirit <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> leaning back in his chair quiet and almost surly while the clothiers and blanket makers vaunted his prowess and rehearsed his deeds many of them interspersing their flatteries with coarse invectives against the operative class was a delectable sight for Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> His heart tingled with the pleasing conviction that these gross eulogiums shamed <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> deeply and made him half scorn himself and his work On abuse on reproach on calumny it is easy to smile but painful indeed is the panegyric of those we contemn Often had <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> gazed with a brilliant countenance over howling crowds from a hostile hustings He had breasted the storm of unpopularity with gallant bearing and soul elate but he drooped his head under the half bred tradesmen s praise and shrank chagrined before their congratulations <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> could not help asking him how he liked his supporters and whether he did not think they did honour to his cause But it is a pity lad he added that you did not hang these four samples of the unwashed If you had managed _that_ feat the gentry here would have riven the horses out of the coach yoked to a score of asses and drawn you into <PERSON>Stilbro</PERSON> like a conquering general <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> soon forsook the wine broke from the party and took the road In less than five minutes Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> followed him They rode out of <LOCATION>Stilbro</LOCATION> together It was early to go home but yet it was late in the day The last ray of the sun had already faded from the cloud edges and the October night was casting over the moorlands the shadow of her approach Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> moderately exhilarated with his moderate libations and not displeased to see young <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> again in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> and to have him for his comrade during the long ride home took the discourse much to himself He touched briefly but scoffingly on the trials and the conviction he passed thence to the gossip of the neighbourhood and ere long he attacked <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> on his own personal concerns <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> I believe you are worsted and you deserve it All was smooth Fortune had fallen in love with you She had decreed you the first prize in her wheel twenty thousand pounds she only required that you should hold your hand out and take it And what did you do You called for a horse and rode a hunting to <ORGANIZATION>Warwickshire</ORGANIZATION> Your sweetheart Fortune I mean was perfectly indulgent She said I ll excuse him he s young She waited like Patience on a monument till the chase was over and the vermin prey run down She expected you would come back then and be a good lad You might still have had her first prize It capped her beyond expression and me too to find that instead of thundering home in a breakneck gallop and laying your assize laurels at her feet you coolly took coach up to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> What you have done there Satan knows nothing in this world I believe but sat and sulked Your face was never lily fair but it is olive green now You re not as bonny as you were man And who is to have this prize you talk so much about Only a baronet that is all I have not a doubt in my own mind you ve lost her She will be Lady Nunnely before Christmas Hem Quite probable But she need not to have been Fool of a lad I swear you might have had her By what token Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> By every token by the light of her eyes the red of her cheeks Red they grew when your name was mentioned though of custom they are pale My chance is quite over I suppose It ought to be But try it is worth trying I call this Sir <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> milk and water And then he writes verses they say tags rhymes _You_ are above that <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> at all events Would you advise me to propose late as it is Mr <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> at the eleventh hour You can but make the experiment <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> If she has a fancy for you and on my conscience I believe she has or had she will forgive much But my lad you are laughing Is it at me You had better grin at your own perverseness I see however you laugh at the wrong side of your mouth You have as sour a look at this moment as one need wish to see I have so quarrelled with myself <PERSON>Yorke</PERSON> I have so kicked against the pricks and struggled in a strait waistcoat and dislocated my wrists with wrenching them in handcuffs and battered my hard head by driving it against a harder wall Ha I m glad to hear that Sharp exercise yon I hope it has done you good</ner>
