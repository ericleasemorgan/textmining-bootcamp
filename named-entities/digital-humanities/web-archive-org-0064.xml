post on the Dark Side of the <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> conference yesterday Consider this In 2007 <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith</PERSON> observed When I first started attending humanities computing conferences in the mid 1990s I was struck by how many of the presentations remarked either explicitly or implicitly that concerns that had taken over so much academic work in literature of gender race class sexuality were irrelevant to humanities computing For those not held back by the sentimental and simplistic question of whether books would be displaced by electronic media the field of humanities computing brought the models and rigors of science to the intellectual work of literary and artistic criticism and theory and in that fulfilled some new critical dreams of bringing objectivity rational thought and aesthetic purity to departments of English Scientific matters of mathematics and computation objective and hard do not seem to be subject to the concerns of gender race or sexuality 2 2 so the reasoning goes always equals 4 whether you are black a woman a queer a straight or whatever HTML SGML XML the codes that make words and images texts processable and TEI conformancy are supposedly gender race class neutral The codes always work and the principles always apply whatever one s personal identity or social group or so many seemed to believe It was as if these matters of objective and hard science provided an oasis for folks who do not want to clutter sharp disciplined methodical philosophy with considerations of the gender race and class determined facts of life After all in the wake of the sixties the humanities in general and their standings in particular had suffered according to some from being feminized by these things Humanities computing seemed to offer a space free from all this messiness and a return to objective questions of representation 4 <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith</PERSON> The Human Touch Software of the Highest Order Revisiting

image <PERSON>William Cummings</PERSON> 10 May 2013 at 8 14 am Reply Two contrasting thoughts I think of DH as providing a set of tools These tools do not engage any topics on their own but only those chosen by the user So this question would be about digital humanists rather than digital humanities But then I got to thinking more and as someone who focuses on Asian history and culture it is clear that the overwhelming body of texts and data available for DH analysis are in English My interests in colonialism and non Western topics thus lags English sources and traditional historical topics are the low hanging fruit for this new approach I am waiting for say the Dutch VOC archives to attract DH projects or Chinese court records Hopefully we will get there image <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith</PERSON> 10 May 2013 at 8 58 am Reply Though HASTAC is a welcome exception an overwhelming majority of digital humanities works try to act as if tools are transparent as if the biases druthers preferences ideologies philosophical stances of the toolmakers will not inhere in the ways particular tools shape our perceptions of and stances toward information and knowledge building More than a decade ago <PERSON>Bowker</PERSON> and Star see SORTING THINGS OUT and <PERSON>George Lakoff</PERSON> WOMEN FIRE AND DANGEROUS THINGS acutely analyzed how this is just not possible I ve tried to be aware of that in my dh work In other words the tools influence how questions are formed what is seen and not seen A colleague sent me a link to an article about digitizing <PERSON>Tagore</PERSON> s work in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> We need to acknowledge the imperial nature of English which frames ideas in a particular way subject verb object and in doing so begin to work in different languages and with more flexible if just as rigorous frameworks mn image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 10 May 2013 at 9 15 am Reply Thank you for writing this <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> and Adeline It is so important It is interesting that one of the most persistent dynamics in DH is that those most dedicated to the dominance of tools are also the most resistant to viewing them critically that is they are most insistent that tool use is a fine form of theoretical humanities and yet most resistant to understanding the humanities the way many maybe even most of us do That insistence on neutrality is one of the few beliefs one might have thought the humanities in general to have overturned over several decades so it is odd but maybe expectable to see it return especially in a guise that doesn t want to talk about the very issue it is putting forward in other words we don t even get to talk about or at least we shouldn t which is exactly how many of us think ideology works rather than for the most part having a direct discussion about political investments As side notes I d advocate for the view of majority languages rather than English being imperial Spanish French German Dutch Portuguese Mandarin Japanese and many others are also imperial within some contexts Spanish is not particularly imperial within the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> but more like a minority language Getting the web to not be hostile toward speakers of minority languages is a huge urgent and non obvious task and involves much more than spreading out toward the other 200 majority languages Also I d want to stick up for <PERSON>Tara McPherson</PERSON> s Scalar project amp Vectors journal definitely another big exception to the tools are transparent perspective image <PERSON>Salvador Barajas</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 8 42 am Reply Just a quick note to your side note <PERSON>David</PERSON> I certainly do not want to take away from your comments on DH but I think it s important to keep in mind that the history of Spanish is in fact imperial in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and it s minority status is a recent discursive phenomenon Lest we forget the Spanish Crown and later <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> claimed most of the <LOCATION>US Southwest</LOCATION> as sovereign territory for a couple of centuries image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 10 03 am Reply Hi Salvador That s absolutely correct and I m sorry if I even seemed to be suggesting otherwise if anything I meant to draw attention to the fact that despite the negative affect displayed toward Spanish in the English speaking <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> today which I do believe should be called out and countered when possible it is mostly an imperial language when seen from global an and historical perspectives Even what we today call Spanish itself Castilian was imperial within the territories that went to make up <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> etc <PERSON>David</PERSON> image andrew smart 10 May 2013 at 9 35 am Reply Adding to the comments above maybe I think since at least the 90 s the reduction in cost and simultaneous increase in power of PCs and extending now to the cloud has enabled the development of types of analysis that allow us to see things at levels of description that were unimaginable just 30 years ago In my area neuroscience and human computer interaction we can now pretty reliably infer certain cognitive states based on munging enormous amounts of high dimensional EEG data almost in real time all on one mostly normal computer I fully agree that the tools we use the computers machine learning algorithms the EEG sensors all come with their own biases and assumptions And we who program the computers do the experiments analyze the data have our own assumptions just as any human does who investigates things I agree 100 with putting all your implicit assumptions and biases on the table so that you can discuss them and hopefully improve them The same algorithms that we use on EEG data can and have been applied to massive text archives to reveal relationships among semantic concepts musical genres power relationships etc there are references I m in too much of a hurry to get right now image The advantage of this approach is that you can process far more text in a few seconds than any individual humanities researcher could process in a lifetime And people in the computer science world would claim that their methods are objective in that the algorithms do not have human biases even though I think it s obvious that the algorithms are biased because they were designed by humans Nevertheless I think this approach can be an important tool in studying oppression racism sexism because there tends to be resistance to the idea of structural oppression toward minorities and women when this oppression is pointed out by individual scholars working from selected texts For example it is possible to process millions of news paper articles from digital archives or from <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> books etc and with semantic algorithms reveal how power racism and sexism is expressed in text I guess this is otherwise known as Big Data But it s mostly used now to sell us more useless crap or see if we re terrorists These tools can also be used to reveal and resist those things I think The interesting thing is to see how closely the algorithmic approach mimics our own human intuitions about such things Because some of the algorithms are meant to be models of how the human brain learns and processes semantic information So while you don t escape the bias problem by using these tools you can discover perhaps latent or hidden relationships by moving the level of analysis to these enormous scales Sorry that s long winded image Roopika Risam 14 May 2013 at 6 44 pm Reply Thanks for your comment Andrew In response to your observation about technological innovations since the 90s I d add that you have unintentionally alluded to a different sort of DHPoco concern for the vulnerable labor sources of cheap products many of whom work under dubious and unregulated conditions in the Global South Pingback cesgnal image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 10 May 2013 at 12 45 pm Reply I don t think anyone is reluctant to fuse digital methodologies and questions of politics or identity On the contrary this is a combination of approaches that s very likely to interest a wide audience No researcher would want to avoid that sort of topic unless they have a morbid fear of getting published in a prestigious venue But questions of identity are also challenging to address digitally I think what people need is not encouragement to try this project but assistance overcoming specific obstacles For instance we don t have good metadata for most of these categories at least not on the scale where I find digital methods most useful In collaboration with <PERSON>Mike Black</PERSON> I ve created a bit metadata for gender but there s a lot more work to be done If someone decided to create metadata about nationality for instance they could very quickly discover publishable results image <PERSON>Brian Lennon</PERSON> 10 May 2013 at 1 05 pm Reply Responding to bullet point 3 above scholars who do affiliate with DH ought also to know and use work on digital colonialisms that can t necessarily be claimed as existing DH work on that topic should

<PERSON>Martha Nell</PERSON> s panels at <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> entitled Agora Techno Phobia Philia Feminist Critical Inquiry Knowledge Building Digital Humanities Parts I and II were among the most stirring and thought provoking I ve heard at DH over the years and I ve heard many I remember in particular excellent talks by <PERSON>Laura Mandell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Susan Brown</PERSON> among others I wonder if it s time to re ignite those discussions perhaps by holding the next panel in the series image <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON> M rquez 10 May 2013 at 3 11 pm Reply One thing that occurs to me reading this thread is that perhaps one of the issues facing DH is its inability to recruit and retain practitioners from diverse backgrounds don t love the word diversity but you know what I mean people of color working class people women queer people people with disabilities etc I wonder if part of the reason that DH hasn t been as widely applied to questions of coloniality and while we re at African American and Latin studies is because of the lack of diversity in its ranks While there are some amazing organizations like Black Girls Code that try and incorporate marginalized communities into the practice of computing for the most part i think that it can be an alienating world There are few models for what it looks like to be for example a queer person of color in a DH world In sum I guess I think that an important first step might be trying to create fellowships or bootcamps or some other infrastructure that brings together current DH practitioners of color and allies with students who are not traditionally represented in DH and start to have these conversations about race gender sexuality and disability as well as create a safe space in which to learn those skills necessary to be involved in computing and coding Pingback cmarque image <PERSON>Josh Honn</PERSON> 10 May 2013 at 3 16 pm Reply Thank you for this open thread this is a fantastic idea that I hope recurs in the future I m just now diving into <PERSON>Nell Smith</PERSON> s piece and when she writes standards need also to be more interdisciplinary and take into account the messy facts of authorship production and reception race class gender and sexuality I think as a librarian instantly to the work of the radical cataloger <PERSON>Sanford Berman</PERSON> who has been fighting for years to alter and extend the often racist and sexist subject headings of the Library of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> In DH we do a lot of cataloging curating encoding and other types of sorting and classifying that all too often are un thought of as impartial inert and neutral though as probably most people reading this know that is most certainly not the case I would like to keep alive <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> s efforts furthering them to include radical re conceptions of definitions of what we do as well DH librarianship programming criticism etc A second and slightly unrelated thought I think we give a lot of lip service to issues of access when creating digital projects but have not historically done a good job on this front I would like to see more responsive designs responsive not only to the multiplicity of screens and devices but to types of users including hearing and seeing impaired users with slower connections etc I think a lot of this links back to <PERSON>Nell Smith</PERSON> s idea of adding the messy into our standards and this includes leveraging web standards to afford greater access to our projects I think in a way this is an approach very much aligned with the open access movement too I m often frustrated when I confront radical critiques of digital culture published in such exploitative and closed ways online work given away to corporate publishers and sold back to the very institution who created the work The reasons for this are many of course tenure pressures usually being the biggest but I d like to see increased discussion and consideration on this topic as well We re doing a better job critiquing the capitalist structures that create and control digital culture and technologies but maybe not as good a job at critiquing those same structures that perpetuate our work image <PERSON>Amy Earhart</PERSON> 16 May 2013 at 9 26 am Reply Thanks for the reference to <PERSON>Sanford Berman</PERSON> I ve been looking at the <ORGANIZATION>LOC</ORGANIZATION> classification to try to think about problematic ontologies of categorization I m going to follow up on <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> s work You are absolutely right about the consideration of disability I ve said for years that the way to engage with this problem is to have grant agencies tie money to compliance I ve seen good work in disability studies on design that would really enrich DH image <PERSON>Ian Bogost</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 8 39 am Reply On the one hand anyone who believes computational platforms are transparent doesn t really understand those platforms But on the other hand a blind focus on identity politics above all other concerns has partly prevented humanists from deeply exploring the technical nature of computer systems in order to grasp those very understandings image adelinekoh 11 May 2013 at 8 58 am Reply Could you elaborate on what you mean by a blind focus on identity politics above all concerns preventing humanists from deeply exploring the technical nature of computer systems Thanks image <PERSON>Ian Bogost</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 9 22 am Reply It s a matter of methodological oversealousness Of refusing to look at hardware and software engineering as areas that might educate the humanist and improve his or her efforts rather than simply serving as ideological targets for clever accusatory trumps <PERSON>Nick Montfort</PERSON> and I wrote a paper for DAC 2009 on myths of platform studies which addresses some of this It is on my website somewhere Anyway after presenting it we were criticized for not taking the body as a platform That s a good example The body isn t a computer But talking about computers doesn t preclude us from also talking about bodies Sorry for not saying more tapping this out on my phone image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 11 27 am Reply I think I can turn the screw one more time on that one in a way you may agree with there has been a distinct impulse within some parts of DH not ALL parts by any means but a substantial part and in digital culture more generally that in resisting the view of the digital as culturally constructed thereby discourages others from engaging with digital tools at a more productive level Which goes back to <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> s original essay And to which again I think <PERSON>Tara McPherson</PERSON> s questions about feminist software amp implementation of <ORGANIZATION>SCALAR</ORGANIZATION> and some similar efforts on HASTAC have been the exceptions image <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 12 01 pm <PERSON>David</PERSON> and all I really wish we could go further than detached observations like there has been a distinct impulse within some parts of DH and thereby discourages others etc Please I m not asking for anyone s good name and reputation to be dragged through the mud but I m honestly curious as to who it is that is making influential arguments about the digital not being culturally constructed which others among us then take up as influential and propagate in such influential ways as to discourage or prohibit counter arguments Can we be good enough disciplinary historians to get down to the level of something like a particular series of papers its derivatives and impact Not to indite but to at least place a commonly held example before us Wouldn t that be the thing to genuinely further discussion image <PERSON>Ian Bogost</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 2 39 pm Notwithstanding the branch of conversation <PERSON>Matt</PERSON> opened up and that continues below I do think this characterization describes a real pattern <PERSON>Tara McPherson</PERSON> s work on feminist software offers a window into the degree of difficulty at work here to really show how gender assumptions are baked into computer systems is such an enormous task it s hard to know how to begin sometimes So I fear we often see a kind of centrifuge effect in which the easiest heaviest observations e g rightfully observing the connection between issues of identity and computation spin out to the edges and take the place of the more intricate harder and often less immediately gratifying analysis and system building that we truly require to make progress on this matter image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 9 00 am Reply I think there s actually a lot of good work being done that grapples with categories of identity From the Brown Women Writers Project to that piece by <PERSON>Neal Caren</PERSON> about the representation of gender in NYT http nbviewer ipython org 5105037 to <ORGANIZATION>Matt Jockers Macroanalysis</ORGANIZATION> which has quite a lot about race and ethnicity as well as gender Basically these topics interest people You d have to be peculiarly self destructive to seek a refuge from them Postcoloniality is probably one of the harder categories to get at because digitized collections aren t evenly global in scope because you might have to work in multiple languages and because the 1923 wall is especially frustrating here But I don t see any obstacles that can t be overcome <ORGANIZATION>HathiTrust Research Center</ORGANIZATION> is working hard to find ways around copyright barriers and I m guardedly optimistic Pingback Ted_Underwood image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 12 46 pm Reply in reply to <PERSON>Matt</PERSON> I ll risk two examples 1 the MIT Press Digital_Humanities book which on my reading stays far away from discussing the tools as cultural products and could only even mount a legitimate claim to do so in a positive valence It repeats a great number of canards with an anti corporate valence but not seeming to realize that these are routinely promoted within the business world about the revolutionary aspects of tool use but rarely if ever discusses the circulation of particular tools and methods in culture as a whole that is it appears not to take seriously any of the sort of cultural analysis of computers and computation found in work like mine <PERSON>Paul Edwards Phil Agre Wendy Chun</PERSON> s <PERSON>Tara McPherson</PERSON> s although her project is actually mentioned favorably but not her line of critique <PERSON>Lisa Nakamura</PERSON> s and many others and moves forward as if these lines of reasoning do not exist 2 <ORGANIZATION>Speclab</ORGANIZATION> a foundational DH project lab and an experience in which I was forced to participate in violation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> s own guidelines and practices on use of junior faculty in which we were routinely told that the codex book is an unstable object or machine for producing interpretations yet on the few occasions when I dared to ask are representations on the computer itself not also unstable in just the same way my questions were tossed off with bemused grins And in return for my forced and involuntary service to other people s research projects although given as cheerfully and willingly as I knew how I have now been written out of that history entirely Someone might even have published a book about it in which my name does not appear a single time despite being one of only two faculty members who participated in it anywhere near as long as I did and the only English professor I don t think it s fair to ask me to read that book but I ve heard nothing about it suggesting that there is any consideration there of the tools as cultural objects as I understand the concept 3 Building on that I don t think Radiant Textuality applies anything like the critical pressure to the computer that its author does so ably to textual objects Photoshop is not an unstable interpretation machine it s a transparent tool that can be used to produce deformations etc In more recent work its author has taken a more expansive view from what I can tell but I see little of it in that book image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 12 46 pm Reply i risked three image <PERSON>Alan Liu</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 1 15 pm Reply This post is also online on my site http liu english ucsb edu the digital humanities and identity issues I think that the distinctive identity issue to address in considering the intermingling of race class gender sexuality and disability and the digital humanities is the political economy of digital human identity today Such identity consists in a relational set of overlaps and differences between at least two groups of the digital human those who stand in the position of producers or managers of the technologies and media that shape life in the information age and those whose power of identity to use <PERSON>Manuel Castells</PERSON> term from his trilogy about network society is shaped by or against those technologies and media without having direct access to producing or managing them More accurately agency over technologies is fluid for each individual such that one s experience as a digital identity is constantly in flux between controlling and controlled e g even the savviest tech person is cattle in a <ORGANIZATION>TSA</ORGANIZATION> security line though it is certain that some national racial gender and other population or sociological groups have greater agency or more always on agency than others I bracket the word groups above because it is a placeholder term What I find generally unsatisfactory so far about the way we try to discuss identity and social justice issues in the digital humanities as well as technology and media generally in new media studies is that we seek to factor identity and social groups directly into the political economy of the digital human and vice versa Missing in our discourse is a whole set of meso level group identities that act as transmission agents filters frames etc but that are neither the home nor the refuge of humans in the digital age but uncannily both There are at least two of these meso identity formations that really matter institutions and professions What I mean can be quickly sketched in the portraits or perhaps passport pictures of the many engineers and programmers whose entire social cultural national and ethnic identity has been mediated shaped constrained but also emancipated by finding refuge sometimes they are literally refugees in an institution and a profession Recognizing the agency of these meso level identity formations moves us into a whole other register of issues about identity There are plenty of problems and contradictions at that level including hypocrisy and injustice But it cannot be said that the institutions and professions involved with their diversity management programs lobbying for H 1B visas domestic partner policies etc not to mention the institutions that are against all that are simply neutral or oblivious in regard to race class gender sexuality and disability It s that the problems are shifted onto an additional level that must be factored in alongside the social and cultural group levels At that meso level we re witnessing today a gigantic historical change in the relation between the two formations I mentioned institutions and professions which overlap but are not isometric with each other Operationally what we call neoliberalism and postindustrialism proceeds through a shift in power within institutions from professionals to upper managers and within the phylum of managers specifically to finance people Restructuring is thus a kind of internal colonization of professionals many of whom in tech firms by the way immigrated from the original colonies What we call privatization is the aggressive propagation of this trend from business institutions in particular to the so called soft institutions like universities and government agencies that either have indirect relations to efficiency metrics or that have multiple or contradictory missions all of which makes them susceptible to pressure to conform to the trends of hard institutions with clearer metrics and missions Much of this is from neoinstitutionalism scholarship in the sociology field which theorizes and studies empirically the non rational forces that drive the formation and propagation of institutions e g normative cultural cognitive symbolic and other forces So in my view thinking about the intermingling of race class gender sexuality and disability and the digital humanities requires that we think simultaneously about the institutional and professional identities that are today the staging ground for that intermingling I like very much for example <PERSON>Natalia Cecire</PERSON> s comments along these lines in her Introduction Theory and the Virtues of <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities Discussing</ORGANIZATION> the epistemology of building in DH she writes digital humanities thus comes to be represented as a return to a white male industrial order of union jobs and visible products when in reality it is the subdiscipline of the humanities most closely implicated in the postindustrial feminization of labor with all that follows upon it the rise of contingent and modular work interstitiality the hegemony of immaterial labor the monetization of affect She adds I am troubled by the ease with which the epistemology of building occludes and even through its metaphors legitimizes digital humanities complicity with exploitative postindustrial labor practices both within the academy and overseas Of course I think we should also be mindful of <PERSON>Stephen Ramsay</PERSON> s rebuttal of 5 Sept 2013 to <PERSON>Daniel Allington</PERSON> s The Managerial Humanities <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> reacts strongly to overt connections being made between digital humanities and corporatism neo liberalism anti intellectualism etc and repudiates the view that the digital humanities can be held responsible for the managerial humanities the death of the humanities the downfall of the university or any of the other facile notions with which they are <ORGANIZATION>associated DH</ORGANIZATION> is a small player in much of this and can t be asked to bear outsize responsibility for either representing or resisting the historical forces of our times But the neoinstitutional approach I suggest is helpful in thinking about where and how DH does shape and is shaped by the multilevel problems of human identity today The direct responsibility that the DH field has is to its institution of higher education and related cultural or heritage institutions through which its relation to institutions in other social sectors is mediated DH has not been shy to exert critical and agential force within its institution not only through its building activities but through its vocal often passionate support of open access collaboration alt ac etc The trick is to open that critical force outward so that DH is aware that in specializing in the technologies and practices in its own institution it is also in the sweet spot for thinking about the premises it shares and does not share with other great knowledge work institutions today that rely on the same kinds of technologies and practices At the end of the day it s useful to cast these issues in pedagogical terms What do I as a digital humanists want to teach my students I want them to come out of university with the intellectual methods and technical skills needed to interoperate across the institutions and professions for which they are headed But I want them also to have retained enough of a comparative sense of the differences in premises and identities vested in society s institutions and professions that they can enter that fray as what we used to call well rounded human beings The companies call that flexible these days But in educational and cultural institutions we call that being ethical having the ability to think critically seeing things through others eyes etc The difference between those two shades of flexibility is what society needs different institutions and professions for and why there shouldn t just be a single great <ORGANIZATION>Google Inc</ORGANIZATION> or any other Inc The digital humanities can really be a sweet spot for teaching such differences encoded as it were as low in the stack as how databases are appropriately used in different social contexts <PERSON>Todd Presner</PERSON> s truly

<PERSON>Todd Presner</PERSON> s truly wonderful work in progress on The Ethics of the Algorithm is image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 2 52 pm Reply Just a brief comment to register that I m persuaded here DH can and should be a sweet spot for this sort of self reflexive institutional social critique It strikes me that it s not going to be at all easy to do this well It would be easy to convey a generalized suspicion of authority which btw is not a bad thing But the program <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> is proposing is not a simple matter of advocacy it would require us to grapple seriously with several social sciences as well as all the other disciplines we re already trying to understand I don t say that in a discouraged way On the contrary I think this is an inspiring mission for the humanities But perhaps it s a responsibility that needs to be broadly distributed across departments and disciplines On the other hand it s true that people doing digital work could be in a particularly good position to speak to these issues image <PERSON>Alex Gil</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 3 14 pm Reply Alas I was writing mine while this one was being posted <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> breaks down here what I clumsily hinted at when I called for an awareness of different institutional contexts at stacked levels of analysis Very useful Alan Looking forward to reading the sociological tradition you re pointing to I agree with <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ted</PERSON> that DH while probably inordinately burdened with the responsibility for larger forces might be the perfect tight rope between the scylla of critique and the charybdis of design image <PERSON>Alan Liu</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 5 27 pm Reply Just some quick comments on Ted s and <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> s replies in place of what if I had time could really be full posts in themselves I do think that the kind of mission I describe requires a more broadly distributed set of disciplinary alliances than we usually imagine for DH We often talk about bridging to engineering and CS to the arts etc But we need social scientists to be part of our orbit as well The relation of DH to critique is a rich rich topic one of the most interesting parts of the theory issue in DH I m influenced at present by <PERSON>Rita Felski</PERSON> s ongoing work criticizing critique e g this piece a piece I ve read by <PERSON>James Smithies</PERSON> a really good essay that I don t think is published anywhere yet and <PERSON>Bruno Latour</PERSON> on compositionism PDF DH s so called epistemology of building is iterative ad hoc and processual in a way that is often post critically critical any oxymoron meaning that DH can be structurally critical of absolute finished stable grounds not to mention platforms of truth without being tonally critical That makes it uncannily similar yet I would say somehow also different from postindustrial enterprises whose ideology of innovation implemented through restructurings at all levels processes organizational units staffing etc is also post critical disruptive of established realities while somehow also being buoyantly hyper enthusiastic i e emphasizing creative destruction and not creative destruction The puzzle that a comparative institutional framework might help solve is how DH overlaps with but is different from other kinds of post critical flexible iterative and processual knowledge work facilitated by technology Is an infinitely flexible and fungible set of database relations or other structured relations encoded in a DH curated set of knowledges for instance the same as knowledge hoards in private enterprise as they now exit the digital version of what <PERSON>Marx</PERSON> called primitive accumulation to become aggregators in highly structured and cross partnered ways image <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 1 17 pm Reply Thanks for those <PERSON>David</PERSON> and the bonus third With regard to number 1 I would submit it s too early to judge the lasting reception and influence of a book that was published not six months ago indeed and at the risk of contradicting myself the intensity of the online debate which met it

<ORGANIZATION>IATH</ORGANIZATION> but being discouraged by being shunted around to the marketing reps as opposed to anyone on the tech team In any case as you say the work has evolved and indeed much of my own for better or for worse has been about applying exactly that sort of critical pressure to computers as unstable objects albeit along primarily materialist and historical lines But the examples <PERSON>David</PERSON> furnished here at my request above can and should also speak for themselves so do others find that these in particular have been notable in terms of shutting down cultural critique Or are there others that ought to be considered as well image <PERSON>Brian Lennon</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 3 00 pm Reply In some ways it seems to me that we ought to have more voices joining this conversation not least because it now offers several different strands to be followed But regarding <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> s most recent question we might certainly continue by identifying specific publications and projects that some of us may see as having at least actively attempted to shut down cultural critique <PERSON>Kirschenbaum</PERSON> s phrasing in various ways I do not think we can conclude that such efforts have succeeded I m sure much dispute might follow from that and that that in turn might produce clarification and thus be worthwhile But that would also displace the framing of this discussion originally as I took it at least by a question about refuge and taking refuge that is as a structural question about overlooking or avoiding something as distinguishable from actively working to suppress it In her comment above <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON> M rquez remarks on the lack of diversity in the ranks of self identified digital humanities enthusiasts and wonders as I read it if the problem begins there with consequences for what is noticed becomes known and is valued as an object of research No responsible thinker could discount all the complexities of the mediation that <PERSON>Alan Liu</PERSON> so persuasively identifies as in play here But I can t help sensing that there s also something somewhat more direct and conclusive to be said about that responding to the particular and I think productive way this discussion was originally framed image <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 9 55 am Reply Here I will simply remind that my identification question was a response to <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> s contention above that there is a substantial constituency within DH resisting the view of the digital as culturally constructed a move which thereby discourages others from engaging with digital tools at a more productive level I requested examples of that discourse preferably at the level of citation which <PERSON>David</PERSON> provided and I proceeded to comment on the extent to which I found them compelling <PERSON>David</PERSON> s language of a distinct impulse amongst a substantial segment of self identified DHers speaks to a broad and highly developed phenomenon surely one that must extend beyond the three examples he has already provided which in fact are historically localized to a very specific strain of DH I still think this particular line of discussion must continue its descent from innuendo to specifics if it is to advance productively though I of course agree that this is not the only productive line the entirety of discussion might take As for the language of shutting down cultural critique I am happy to defer to <PERSON>David</PERSON> s phrasing of discouragement image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 10 17 am Reply I don t want to turn this into a pissing contest but I m not sure the word innuendo is especially charitable You dismissed one of my examples because you weren t there but I was pointing to a published book emerging from that experience which I ve heard widely referred to as are the other two books and to start questioning their degree of influence as a kind of innuendo seems odd I mentioned my personal experience only to point out that for being a well known cultural critic of the digital I was erased from the public history of SpecLab despite being a major contributor to it for two years the only evidence you need of that is a the published book which does not mention me and b my pledge that I was there for two years and participated heavily These are prominent books by major DH scholars and 3 of the most prominent recent DH books They constitute examples of the turn away from cultural criticism in DH that is not paralleled to my knowledge in literary studies of the same period This thread begins with an excerpt from <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith Alan Liu Tara McPherson Rita Raley Wendy Chun Richard Grusin</PERSON> me <PERSON>Brian Lennon</PERSON> and quite a few others have said we feel a distinct difference in the way some DH operates as a form of literary criticism Instead of taking seriously these concerns by a wide range of technically and culturally knowledgeable scholars they are termed innuendo Even this thread instead of discussing the issues raised by <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> s original essay in a productive sense is turning into a defense vs offense form of combat in which one notices not many women or people of color contributing I will ask as was asked on the Managerial Humanities thread do you really want to say that all of us are just making things up or expressing some kind of buried fear of technology Would you dismiss all our assembled perspectives on any other topic related to current scholarship as innuendo I will also point to the fact that this thread was in part engendered by a review I wrote of the Dark Side of the <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> conference whose proceedings a major voice in DH pronounced as silliness based only on reading the publicity materials for the conference and whose subject was explicitly cultural criticism of the digital I have been trying to be charitable about the current mindset in most of DH but if that remark in and of itself and its maker s belief that the readers of Humanist would likely assent to it is not an indication that there remains to this day a significant bias against cultural critique and particularly cultural critique of the digital in DH I don t know what would be image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 10 21 am Reply By the way I am working on a piece about this which will hopefully come out soon but it is worth reading what the recent D_H book says about cultural studies and the state of literary studies today It is not something most cultural critics will be happy about image <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 11 00 am I didn t dismiss the example <PERSON>David</PERSON> I said I couldn t comment on it And I really can t As for innuendo I don t think it s especially in appropriate given the construction of your original language but it really wasn t meant to be especially uncharitable either Honest So please consider it retracted As for the silliness remark it was voiced by one scholar in the context of a listserv discussion and I note that <PERSON>Ken Wark</PERSON> in another venue has inclined to not overly fixate on it In any case myself <PERSON>Steve Ramsay</PERSON> and others who would no doubt be pegged as part of the DH establishment have distanced ourselves from it I was sincere when I said I appreciated your review I myself do not think c21dsd was silly or otherwise misguided or misaligned nor would I personally shy from terming it digital humanities not least because so many of the papers there clearly emerged from longstanding hands on engagements with various forms of digital work image <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 11 03 am Gad Especially inappropriate is what I meant to write If my typing betrays me so be it image adelinekoh 12 May 2013 at 12 32 pm For some reason I can t respond to <PERSON>Matt</PERSON> s last comments directly But I did want to ask re specifics I think as you both know it s a touchy subject to raise particularly by people who don t have a lot of standing within the community As <PERSON>Domenico</PERSON> rightly points out below with an example But is it possible to criticize specific DH totems without risking rapid isolation or being held up to public ridicule image <PERSON>Matthew Kirschenbaum</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 1 29 pm It is a touchy subject and I won t insist further that it be discussed here but I do think at some point we have to bring the same level of material historical scrutiny to bear on DH that we might see in other areas of for example science and technology studies where the work often descends to very specific readings of papers citation networks grants labs and the like indeed <PERSON>David</PERSON> himself has done some of that on his own blog and effectively <PERSON>Patrik Svensson</PERSON> has done it I like to think I ve done it So the claim is not that it hasn t happened but that the work of a disciplinary archaeology genealogy remains very incomplete That is not the only way to accomplish critique but it is one way and a way that enjoys significant intellectual precedent image <PERSON>Brian Lennon</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 2 10 pm With <PERSON>Keguro Macharia</PERSON> s remarks below also in mind I ll suggest another methodological precedent for historicizing DH one more directly consonant with the host rubric <ORGANIZATION>Postcolonial Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> of this open thread That is the historicizing of modern philology that we find in postcolonial studies beginning if that s even the right word quite debatable with <PERSON>Said</PERSON> s Orientalism and moving in many different directions I d say that the intellectual history and legacy of that effort has somewhat more geohistorical intellectual historical and literally agonistic breadth than the debates within STS whose domain as <PERSON>Amit Prasad</PERSON> and others have observed is quite narrower The Postcolonial Science and Technology Studies Reader which I mentioned in an earlier comment is a bit of a novelty in that respect though of course the precedent established by <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> s own work goes back to the 1990s image <PERSON>Chuck Rybak</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 3 19 pm Reply I applaud your repeated calls for specific examples As someone new to DH I ve had an especially difficult time sorting out blanket criticism I ve had some exchanges with people where we try to sort this out Is it this project This initiative Who I also appreciate your response concerning the book Digital_Humanities I actually like that book quite a bit maybe because I m in many ways the intended audience for such an introductory text I didn t find the book at all dogmatic or unaware of the field s protean contested terrain I learned quite a bit from it and was surprised to see some condemn it so quickly image <PERSON>Alex Gil</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 3 05 pm Reply At the edge of dawn I encourage all of us to continue the practice of building and transforming the systems platforms standards as <PERSON>Sanford Berman</PERSON> above communities digital archives classrooms and yes tools that will help us move forward At the edge of dawn we must remain alert to the different realms in which we fight academy nation or the rhyzomatic world While the largest digital corpus available for experimentation might very well still be the pre 1923 English corpus while the institutional history of humanities computing in the North might as well point to a retrenchment of canonical work parallel to the rise of historically excluded groups in departments and academic presses n b that institutional history of DH still needs to be teased out collectively and rigorously while <ORGANIZATION>Wikipedia</ORGANIZATION> recaps a truly provincial world history while English does bring to code several unspoken cultural assumptions as <PERSON>Domenico Fiormonte</PERSON> and others have pointed out and while participation in the professional structures where our DH cultural capital is being doled out in the North seems still to be mostly a white anglo affair the center cannot and does not want hold The world continues to be mostly someone other writ large and we re on it Most folks I know who self identify with our para discipline would welcome such a development I agree wholeheartedly with <PERSON>Ian</PERSON> that we should not refuse to look at hardware and software engineering At the same time I don t share his deterministic conclusion that a blind focus on identity politics prevents us from achieving a working knowledge of the former For that statement to be true the systems themselves would have to operate on a realm where issues of identity cannot reach which contradicts the very point he s trying to make We can and are doing both Yup Martha the builders I know within the academy act as if very little because for the most part they shun the limelight In my experience that does not mean that they are unaware that in principle bias is built into systems At the same time I agree with you that we must do the work to recover the places where they don t know what they know Let s do it as we transform the systems themselves All to github now At the edge of dawn remember the work of Aim C saire He has been often critiqued for his exclusive use of the French language in his poems and plays Even <PERSON>LePen</PERSON> admires him for it ugh Imperial machines ex English and English based code are double edged swords While we must constantly don <ORGANIZATION>G K Chesterton</ORGANIZATION> s fedoras on the chase for fake transparencies and universalisms we cannot deny the usefulness of these machines for South South alliances nor the ways in which these machines are vulnerable to cannibalization into Armes miraculeuses miraculous weapons as C saire would have it And we need those if we are going to resist the pressures of assimilation and make our gambit for true transparency and the universalisms to come Accommodez vous de moi Je ne m accommode pas de vous Here s a sensitive one That same tradition where <PERSON>David</PERSON> had a less than ideal experience is also a branch of the DH family that continues to inspire me While I wasn t part of the Speclab I was there for the beautiful aftermath where playfulness and deformations of all sorts flourished both real and virtual both tacitly and loudly How can we not see the connection here between C saire s miraculous weapons and the impish generosity of the C ville crew <PERSON>David</PERSON> I m not lancing you just acknowledging benevolence where I see it Surely a parallax of sorts is tricking us And to those of you just joining us if you feel unwelcome find us We are here If you give us some time we ll find you This world is not as coherent nor white as it may seem image <PERSON>Ian Bogost</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 3 19 pm Reply I think my blog comment shorthand may have confused my message Because I think you re agreeing with me yet you seem to think you are not I m not sure I am likewise confused about what is deterministic here If it means what I think it does then you may illustrate my clarification My point is that doing hardware and software studies sometimes requires one to bracket identity even if just for a moment in order to learn something in the latter s service But those of us who do that work are frequently chides for failing to focus all energy and all attention at all times on the accuser s notion of what comprises the entire discourse on social justice It s the blindness that s the problem not the focus image <PERSON>Alex Gil</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 4 06 pm Reply Yeah I wasn t sure what you meant That s why I thought it was a bit contradictory Then yes we see eye to eye There is non critical work to be done for the learning process to go apace I can vouch for that The one does not prevent the other nor does it make one subservient to the other I would go even farther and claim that we are not even compromised by this oscillation I think we all get that I hope so anyway image <PERSON>Alex Gil</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 5 45 pm Reply After reading <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON> s comment below it strikes me that I might have been too hasty to generalize based solely on my experience I think for very real pedagogical reasons we should be able to have recourse to both an oscillatory model and one in which identity takes center stage in the learning process What that would entail in and outside of the classroom remains to be seen I know that the Scholars Lab s Praxis Program has been learning how to improve their pedagogical model to address identity at different stacks of the instructional package image <PERSON>Anne Balsamo</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 4 46 pm Reply I didn t know where to insert this comment it isn t a critique of <PERSON>Ian</PERSON> s or anyone s notes in this discussion but queer feminism post colonial thinking race aren t really about identities but rather about technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions such that the plentitude of what reality is gets processed to be one thing and NOT another I elaborate this approach in my chapter Gendering the Technological Imagination that draws deeply from feminist physicist <PERSON>Karen Barad</PERSON> who herself was revisiting foundational insights of <PERSON>Nils Bohr</PERSON> For some of us identity politics and approaches were abandoned many moons ago because of exactly the problems raised in these disucssions I would argue that doing hardare or software studies is about close reading the logics enacted spoken written express where one reads for what is there as much for what is unexpressed Identity based criticism IMHO leads only to a retrograde biological essentialism that is philosophically untenable image <PERSON>Salvador Barajas</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 7 52 am Reply Thank you for adding this post to the discussion <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> It is often easier to categorize the critical inquires that queer feminist post colonial and decolonial thinking as simply identity issues and not fundamental questions of epistemology image <PERSON>Andr Brock</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 12 25 pm Reply Thank you for saying this There s a reason I do critical race rather than simply ethnic studies I m trying to figure out the rhetorics of technoculture rather than simply the empirics of representation image <PERSON>Michael Kramer</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 1 23 pm Andre I find your contrast between rhetorics of technoculture and empirics of representation really productive and clarifying And also the implication is this fair to say that the two are not forever opposed but rather related in important ways that need illumination as are the linkages and differences between critical race studies and ethnic studies more broadly In dialogue even when rhetorically and empirically in tension Thanks <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> image <PERSON>Ian Bogost</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 5 29 pm Reply Actually there s more to say about this but I m tapping responses on my phone

Underwood</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 3 28 pm Reply After reading this thread it strikes me that anyone who did go into DH as a refuge from social theory is going to be very disappointed image andrew smart 11 May 2013 at 3 52 pm Reply I agree with <PERSON>Ian</PERSON> I mean I agree with what I think <PERSON>Ian</PERSON> is saying that learning to engineer hardware of software is itself seen as some kind of betrayal of La R sistance One thing I believe very strongly is that radical theorists humanists and social justice activists have to become as good at the digital however defined as the very white male military industrial complex which originated the computer and the internet is It s a daunting task because that complex has almost unlimited resources and attracts clever people who almost without exception do not ever question their own cultural construction I know because full disclosure I worked in the military industrial complex and largely kept my radicalism secret until I wrote a book that s not why I left blah blah etc anyway I wouldn t go so far as for example <PERSON>Douglas Rouskoff</PERSON> goes in Program or Be Programmed because becoming a really good programmer and a really good humanist scholar might not be possible in a single person s lifetime hence maybe the sentiment that all one s energy must be devoted to the cause But that is exactly why the cliche of interdisciplinary research is actually crucial Every discipline does this physicists are usually not software experts so they have to hire them neuroscientists too etc Many scientists like me can code just well enough to make some pretty graphs out of some data but generally write terrible code that has to be fixed by someone who is an expert I also think there is a limit to the social construction of the digital by virtue of the fact that digital technology at its lowest level relies on the physical laws of how information is represented in voltage The way computers and networks work is determined or maybe very constrained by the laws of physics Obviously what you use these tools for is more open but still limited or constrained We can t yet use computers to travel back or forward in time But DH people can and should I think use computers to empirically study social theory image <PERSON>Ian Bogost</PERSON> 11 May 2013 at 4 51 pm Reply Yeah we re on the same page And I liked the rest of what you said here too Pingback JessieNYC image <PERSON>Domenico Fiormonte</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 5 51 am Reply Thanks to <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> for his post and thanks to everyone for this wonderful conversation I would like to add one item to the race class gender sexuality and disability list language Actually I think that s the first disability of colonized subjects In fact I confess I am not sure I understood everything correctly the prose of this thread in some cases is too sophisticated I wonder how this undermined the basis of their own post colonial argument which is typical of any competitive intellectual discussion I guess It would be difficult for me to compete with such well known and highly rhetorically skilled scholars so I will limit myself to two observations taken from my own and by all means marginal experience 1 In responding to one comment I d like to stress that in academia the worse fate is to be ignored than to be suppressed I was stimulated to speak or to be listened to about the Anglo American dominance of DH when I was invited by <PERSON>Manfred Thaller</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>Cologne Dialogue on Controversies</ORGANIZATION> in the Digital Humanities But that was not the first time I spoke about these issues My first article on cultural colonialism in Humanities Computing some may remember DH is a recent label was published in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in 2001 and I translated circulated and finally put it online after even publicizing it on Humanist http dhhumanist org <LOCATION>Archives Virginia</LOCATION> v17 0645 html in 2004 see now http www academia edu 429118 The_international_debate_on_humanities_computing_education_technology_and_the_primacy_of_languages However I repeat what I already said in my old Humanist post we colonized de colonized and post colonized people do not need to seek legitimation from the center of the world To be at the margins today in theory means to have fewer economical resources but where And for how long but in practice more freedom to create alternative solutions and less dependence on the so called standard tools and models I was pleased to see <PERSON>Bowker</PERSON> et al cited by <ORGANIZATION>Martha Innovation</ORGANIZATION> has little to do with legitimation So maybe after The Day of DH we ll have the Occupy DH day image 2 The lack of a critical reflection on its own tools and methodologies is recognized as one of the main problems in DH today But is it possible to criticize specific DH totems without risking rapid isolation or being held up to public ridicule This month I spent hours with my Masters students trying to make sense of the TEI P5 Guidelines We re working on an encoding of the manuscripts of <PERSON>Federico De Roberto</PERSON> s novel I Vicer one of the masterpieces of Italian XIX century literature The first thing to say is that the students complained a lot because the information on the <ORGANIZATION>TEI</ORGANIZATION> website is confusing and it s hard to find what they need The Italian translation is partial and clumsy so the students are always forced to translate from English And you know TEI is one of the most international DH projects we have in the West But the most striking problem is that 99 of the online examples are taken from Anglo American sources we are using chapter 10 Representation of primary sources something that for obvious reasons drives my students crazy They ask very simple questions like why should we encode our cultural heritage with tools designed by and for an English speaking audience As always we are having trouble representing many of the writing phenomena something the experts call overlapping hierarchies and which after years and years of struggle I have begun to see as the favorite regime s metaphor for a long lasting guerrilla resistance They told you everything s going to be all right and then suddenly these little textual Tupamaros come out from the jungle to spoil your immaculate digital representations All these problems I ve been told for ages by my TEI friends can be solved by looking at similar TEI projects in my case genetic texts good practice from around the world customization <ORGANIZATION>RTFM</ORGANIZATION> etc It might be true But even so you ll need to invest a lot of time and money and when you have money and resources you ll look for mainstream solutions following people and institutions that have invested all their credibility in those solutions So day after day the vicious circle is completed and alternative ideas become useless or dangerous because no one has any interest in throwing away a project that cost millions of dollars The real imperial machine however is XML in itself XML is an historical thanks <PERSON>Brahma</PERSON> application born out of SGML which was NOT believe it or not invented for representing cultural objects So the most serious weakness of its son XML is its most powerful strength its universality While this can be true for any computer languages algorithms etc in this case the consequences seem particularly serious because markup languages impose an epistemological bias on a hermeneutical activity i e transcribing texts DH projects like many other things in our life are like onions made up of different layers of theoretical cultural social linguistic technical sexual etc prejudices or choices if you prefer <PERSON>TEI XML</PERSON> represents the institutional layer of a universally accepted distortion of how a document i e cultural object should be represented digitally But to express these opinions in a public DH gathering is blasphemy because 95 of the most influential DH people institutions and associations are somehow involved in TEI XML or related digital infrastructures But I dare to insist TEI XML like any other successful computing application or language is not the manifest destiny of humankind image andrew

exactly these problems within the defense industry Using these tools they will be able manipulate and own history to a far greater degree than before which is why as I wrote in my last post I think these techniques should not be the sole provenance of <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Martin NSA</ORGANIZATION> etc I would liken it to being able to mass produce books half a millennium ago But today anyone has access to XML and related technologies I too think the issues you raise about XML are being worked on with web ontologies http en wikipedia org wiki Web_Ontology_Language no But there are likely inherent limitations to what kinds of concepts can be represented from any natural language or record of that language which I think is an interesting topic for research image <PERSON>Kevin

ratio of the green font image image adelinekoh 12 May 2013 at 11 51 am Reply Thanks everyone so much for their thoughtful contributions to the thread so far I am sympathetic to much of the concerns raised about the ways in which these are important but complicated questions that require true interdisciplinarity that require assistance overcoming specific obstacles I wonder though whether it is really possible to bracket out race class gender disability postcolonialism or as <PERSON>Domenico</PERSON> rightly points out the role of language in structuring a global DH community It seems to me that that some can afford to bracket out considerations of marginalization is due to what whiteness studies scholars have termed privilege <PERSON>Peggy McIntosh</PERSON> has written about this clearly in her landmark essay on the Invisible Knapsack of white privilege I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege as males are taught not to recognize male privilege So I have begun in an untutored way to ask what it is like to have white privilege I have come to se white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day but about which I was meant to remain oblivious White privilege is like an invisible weightless backpack of special provisions maps passports codebooks visas clothes tools and blank checks My schooling gave me no training in seeing myself as an oppressor as an unfairly advantaged person or as a participant in a damaged culture I was taught to see myself as an individual whose moral state depended on her individual moral will My schooling followed the pattern my colleague <PERSON>Elizabeth Minnich</PERSON> has pointed out whites are taught to think of their lives as a morally neutral normative and average also ideal so that when we work to benefit others this is seen as work which will allow them to be more like us http www isr umich edu home diversity resources white privilege pdf I wonder if readers so far find any resonance in McIntosh s characterization of privilege with regard to DH projects and issues of marginalization No one has claimed that tools are neutral But doesn t bracketing these considerations in building and using these tools indicate a type of privilege Why for example is there little metadata on gender in DH projects available as <PERSON>Ted</PERSON> suggests What does this say about what information has been deemed important and identifiable and how this feeds into invisible forms of privilege image <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON> M rquez 12 May 2013 at 12 14 pm Reply I completely agree with this and I m so happy you brought up <PERSON>McIntosh</PERSON> s work I can t think of a moment when identity disappeared or dissipated even for a moment Especially because as I am coding or doing anything I have the acute awareness that I am not supposed to be able to do this for historical and contemporary reasons I also know for me as a DH newbie the process of learning to ask questions was incredibly difficult and entirely inflected through my identities as a queer woman of color It took a while for me to feel comfortable asking questions I often felt that it revealed that I had been put in this world by mistake or just my general ignorance While I think I have gotten much better about asking questions and not feeling an associated shame I still am hard pressed to think of a moment when my identities are not interacting with the work that I am doing image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 1 31 pm Reply I noted above that we don t have much metadata on gender or nationality and that at <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Mike Black</ORGANIZATION> and I had to create it manually Similarly I think people at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> had to create metadata on gender and nationality for their corpus But I have to say it s not like we started with great metadata on anything else either When I wanted information about genre for instance I had to to create that myself partly manually and partly algorithmically I don t mean to deny that all kinds of privilege have shaped library collections They absolutely have White privilege colonialism it s a familiar story But the collections that resulted are not sufficient for digital research A whole lot of work has to be done on them before they can be used for anything So if you look at what researchers are doing now I don t see a lot of bracketing going on On the contrary I see researchers desperately trying to create organized information about a whole range of issues prominently including issues of identity and difference We re working as hard as we can to address those issues not frankly because we re altruistic but because issues of identity and power pose huge obvious research opportunities No sane person would want to bracket them If certain kinds of identity that you care about haven t received enough attention in this process yet my candid response would be Roll up your sleeves You can view things that haven t been done yet as objects of critique which is fine I have no objection at all to critique But it s also possible to view things that haven t been done yet as research opportunities Get a couple people together and figure out how to create a list of HathiTrust volumes that were published in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> It s worth doing and it will produce a resource you can use for further research image adelinekoh 12 May 2013 at 2 13 pm Reply A careful read of this comment stream itself <PERSON>Ted</PERSON> will reveal that there have been calls for this bracketing No one is denying that these issues are important But even in this thread we have seen suggestions that occasionally doing hardware and software analysis requires occasional bracketing Projects like DHPoco are a form of sleeve rolling Many DH projects with this focus on marginalization exist See the TransformDH Google Document here https docs google com document d 15caTX2281lvG4J0EN9YwgN0pcsbpXeiUVj1m59N5J0Y edit Whether these projects receive the substantial funding and administrative support that others have is another question and this I believe is what <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> s <PERSON>David</PERSON> s <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> s <PERSON>Domenico</PERSON> s comments and remarks have made clear For that matter I don t think the people with our concerns have ever stopped rolling up their sleeves building more traditional DH projects <PERSON>Amy Earhart</PERSON> s essay in Debates in DH regarding the disappearance of DIY recovery projects by people of color is an excellent example But did this recovery work receive substantial institutional and federal support Well how many of these projects are online today And given that most of them are not what does this say about the line of argument that DH has always been open to race class gender sexuality etc image <PERSON>Amy Earhart</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 2 40 pm Reply While there is no doubt that lots of collections aren t ready for much that doesn t mean that we shouldn t directly address complicated issues of race gender nationality etc It makes more sense to think about how to form metadata at the start of the project that considers this rather than trying to tack it on at the end I ve been in a couple of project discussions recently that are thinking through what metadata can do for the nuances of race How does on tag a person for multiple forms of race For example <PERSON>Jean Toomer</PERSON> resisted defining himself as African American but many anthologies add him to the black tradition as a black author He s also at times passed for Italian Does passing itself indicate a cultural form that has been applied that we need to nuance I actually think these sorts of ontological questions in relationship to technology are fascinating and truly help to address some of the concerns of Martha Here is a perfect example of some of the most traditional DH folks having important conversations about technology that has cultural implications http sourceforge net p tei feature requests 425 page 3 I really like the links that focus on trans identity and metadata and think we should focus on these conversations as potential examples of how we might proceed in DH I d also like to point out that if the <ORGANIZATION>TEI</ORGANIZATION> folks are focusing on issues of gender that speaks well for all of us Even though some of the comments clearly resist consideration of cultural studies concerns the change to TEI means that we are seeing shifts in practice There have been ample projects underway they just don t necessarily interact with what often is called DH I m not interested in thinking through the in out dh debate as that isn t productive I am interested in thinking through issues of why scholars of color or scholars that come out of certain cultural studies traditions feel underrepresented by DH What might we do to increase participation Even better what should we learn from those traditions I think an easy overlap is the activist traditions found in both DH and cultural studies fields Thanks <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> for this thread image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 4 03 pm Reply I agree that DHPoco is a form of sleeve rolling and that s an impressive list of projects I m familiar with many of them Re the fate of previous recovery projects I think we re sort of comparing apples and oranges here Building new collections from the ground up seems to me a very difficult task I haven t attempted it because it would require a more durable sort of institutional commitment than I m likely to get from my own university I can only think of a few places that have sustained that sort of commitment over time Brown Women Writers might be the most prominent example For the most part the work I ve attempted is much less ambitious I ve started with existing digital collections and corrected them or enriched their metadata in order to pose particular research questions Of course existing collections have limits and I understand why they won t work as a resource for certain projects But they re also not chopped liver I suspect there are resources that could support research on gender and class and race and sexuality and disability somewhere in the 10 million volumes already stored in HathiTrust I hope it s clear that I m not saying we shouldn t attempt to build new collections The Brown Women Writers Project seems to me a central DH success story and I ve used their archive in my own research I m just saying that kind of thing is hard image <PERSON>Melissa Rogers</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 2 40 pm Reply Thanks for starting this thread I think it s really important that there is a space like this to have these very necessary if difficult conversations As many here have highlighted in different ways feeling comfortable enough to even enter such a conversation is not a luxury we all have participation can produce extreme anxiety not only when your identity feels at once invisible and glaringly obvious but also when you inhabit a space of institutional precariousness such that your very presence in a conversation like this could count against you personally and professionally As a graduate student who has not yet earned her PhD as a queer white woman in her mid twenties who fully benefits from the privileges and status conferred by a major research university I still do not always have the power to make the critiques I want to make in the way I want to make them all this to say that I appreciate the courage exhibited here I m particularly interested in approaching these questions from the angle of a genealogy of the field or fields of DH and that s why I m particularly grateful to <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> for drawing attention to <PERSON>McIntosh</PERSON> s essay I also link to <PERSON>McIntosh</PERSON> s essay in my recent post for <PERSON>Matt Kirschenbaum</PERSON> s graduate seminar in the digital humanities here http mith umd edu engl668k I was presenting on transformDH which I m sure many here are familiar with and which is not as was importantly pointed out on twitter the same project as dhpoco Here s a long excerpt from my post when <PERSON>Tara McPherson</PERSON> reports being asked Why are the digital humanities so white as her essay in Debates in the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> is so provocatively titled we need to ask ourselves what we are doing when we observe whiteness in one space or another How does whiteness and the power and privileges it accrues organize and shape disciplinary spaces and imaginaries in ways that may be invisible to some but glaringly obvious to others How is whiteness represented or not and how does it come to dominate our fields of vision without naming itself What work does whiteness do as a racial logic or a racial formation that critical whiteness studies understands to operate without or even beyond the actions of individual white people There is definitely more than meets the eye here especially when whiteness goes unmarked Thus we might putatively say the digital humanities are so white and in doing so mark and name whiteness yet we would also be constructing a narrative that actively erases or ignores the vital presence contributions and ongoing interventions of scholars and thinkers of color individuals who might also be queer might also be women might also be trans might also be poor and working class might also be alter and disabled might also be working in contexts that do not center the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> might also not be doing their primary work within the multiply privileged site of the academy might also In our discussion today therefore I want us to strategically and temporarily re center whiteness in order to be able to track where it goes and how it moves yet I also want us to recognize and remember that the margins are very real that they do not cease to exist because we who is that anyway cease to think about them and that they are a precarious space where conversations are happening work is being done and lives are being lived What do we want to do when we move what has and continues to be marginalized to the center What is tactical about the space of the margin I think it is essential that digital humanities accounts for its whiteness as <PERSON>McPherson</PERSON> s essay brilliantly begins to do and that it explicitly theorizes it as part of its critical genealogy In women s studies and in queer studies we know or at least we should See <PERSON>Keguro Macharia</PERSON> s most recent Bullybloggers post http bullybloggers wordpress com 2013 01 13 queer genealogies provisional notes that the specifics of the genealogy we tell about the field are fundamental in shaping our field s imaginary what is capable of being thought in a discipline what projects we are allowed to undertake or imagine right down to watch catches our critical interest as an object of study in the first place What could we make newly visible if we told a genealogy of DH as a genealogy of whiteness In doing so what would we risk and how would that be a different set of risks than those at stake in current narratives of the field s formation and consolidation What hopes are we pinning DH For whose benefit do we do this work One brief example In a recent HASTAC forum Alan Turing The First Digital Humanist here http hastac org forums alan turing first digital humanist a number of participants draw attention to <PERSON>Judith Jack Halberstam</PERSON> s generative 1991 essay Automating Gender Postmodern Feminism in the Age of the Intelligent Machine What if we read and taught this essay or the forum as a fundamental digital humanities text If that were the case could we really argue that digital humanists don t do race class gender and sexuality Could anyone really claim going forward that digital humanities is not a space for cultural critique or for examination of identity politics massive scare quotes here because I m not sure any of us could really say definitively what that phrase means It s worth

comments here <PERSON>Melissa</PERSON> and with the caveat that I worry about how whiteness studies recenters whiteness in a way that runs counter to the progressive work that many of its scholars want it to do I think taking a look at DH and other computing fields as a genealogy of whiteness that makes strategic exclusions of women people of color and Third World workers to tell a particular story about itself would be incredibly revealing I m surprised that the rich body of work on colorblindness ideology has not made its way into this conversation Scholars have been looking at problems like this in other disciplines rooting out where cultural power structures even the disciplines like math and science where many least expect it <PERSON>Eduardo Bonilla Silva</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tukufu Zuberi</PERSON> s collection _<ORGANIZATION>White Logic White Methods Racism</ORGANIZATION> and Methodology_ is a great look at how racial power operates in the statistical methods of the social sciences While it has been the work of feminist critical race postcolonial disability and other theorists to uncover these structures all over the place and I don t want to gloss over that work there are some folks who are working specifically on the invisible nature of racial power In the humanities we can look to scholars like <PERSON>Carl Gutierrez Jones Charles Mills Toni Morrison Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze Robyn Wiegman</PERSON> and others The very fact that these meta DH conversations keep circling around the question of whether or not identity matters to these methods seems to me to indicate that it is of utmost importance to the history present and future of the field I will echo the sentiment that has been going around in my feminist tech circles recently if you are not doing the extra labor to ensure that your tool theory conference whatever is specifically inclusive of the groups it has historically left out then your work is exclusionary Full stop The body of work on the operations of colorblindness ideology makes a convincing case that even and especially when you don t see power operating it is there This is a frustrating hard line approach to take for some but it is in the spirit of non tokenistic affirmative action practices And just like affirmative action practices if the digital humanities weren t so white the hard line wouldn t be as necessary

whiteness studies <PERSON>Wiegman</PERSON> s work has really helped my thinking here I also like your attention to the extra and quite intentional labor of widening the circle of conversation I have met so many scholars especially women of color and queers of color who feel that they just cannot take the valuable time and energy from their own work to put toward repeatedly explaining their existence and their interest in the digital to the communities that primarily do work on tech it is stressful and it is draining I think we would be remiss to overlook the affective and other kinds of labor that we would need to practice to create more inclusive and welcoming spaces that actively combat oppressive structures I am glad that twitter conversations and the space offered by threads like this one can become places where we practice public displays of affection and solidarity for one another image <PERSON>Michael Kramer</PERSON> 12 May 2013 at 12 02 pm Reply Does This Post Make Me a Tool This is a rich and multifaceted discussion I just want to add one observations that it has made me ponder The discussion has made me think about the metaphor of tools in digital humanities work This makes sense because the word tools is full of all kinds of associations It is most of all a way to imaginatively bridge the troubling gap between the individual and the machine between older modes of production and autonomy and newer ones It alludes to the romantic vision of handicraft labor it hints at masculinized visions of work in ways that <PERSON>Natalia Cecire</PERSON> convincingly proposes are profoundly gendered it offers a way to overcome questions of scale between the individual and larger overwhelming and dehumanizing structural forces tools are held in the hand safe and under control mastered machines are scary semi autonomous out of control things watch out it s Frankenstein tools are at once something from the deep past often conceptualized as what makes us human as in it is our species nature to create and use them and they are also somehow futuristic key to a cyborgian vision of humans fusing with machines tools are a way of mediating between navigating between compromising between culture and counterculture I m thinking of <PERSON>Fred Turner</PERSON> s great work here on <LOCATION>Stewart Brand</LOCATION> in From Counterculture to Cyberculture as in tools sound are ostensibly small and mobile enough that they can be wielded in an oppositional way by the marginalized oppressed impoverished even though it takes the massive infrastructure of modernity military industrial style to create them and while we re at it let s make a bad joke about tools and all the sexual innuendo therein Tools are doing a lot of work for us not only in building things digitally but in building the theoretical apparatus for this construction zone Men at work Is this union restrictive in its membership Who s working for whom anyway What kind of shop is this Won t get tooled again OK I ll stop I could go on but the main point is this I wonder if part of developing a better critique of digital humanities as refuge from questions of identity structure and power might focus a bit more on this concept of tools and the work that this term is doing conceptually politically institutionally in DH Do we want to imagine platforms software hardware code institutions universities funding agencies bodies identities language discourse networks the digital itself all as tools Or are tools some subset of one of those other categories If everything is a tool what does that framework get us What does it obfuscate What I m proposing is not that tools are part of the problem but rather that the use of that word offers a way into better theorizing and critiquing of what is at stake in digital humanities work Type 1 1 5 2 etc see <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> post and all the responses in relation to questions of identity structure and power into concepts of building and critical analysis of that building into issues of individual agency collective negotiation and institutional organization into the nature of things and people and all that gets

a loss to choose any single thread to engage Instead I ll describe a concern that arises from my experience around these topics I m an island Puerto Rican who has studied literature in English departments for my whole post secondary education I specialize in electronic literature and blog extensively about it bringing to bear my expertise in poetry in English new media studies code studies and other aspects of what I understand to be the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> As a result of my interests and training my I E Poetry blog is in English for a primarily English speaking audience and analyzes works from the contexts of so called American literature and technologies And while many of the poetic traditions I bring to bear are international in scope and I certainly use my knowledge of Spanish and French literature and culture that is not my primary focus I don t foreground my Puerto Rican ness in my research or writing and it doesn t come across as being a big part of my academic identity to the extent that people have commented that I don t count as Hispanic or Puerto Rican This has happened more than once and sometimes off handedly as if it wasn t even an issue Sometimes passing feels like failing image And yet I don t feel compelled to hit the books so to speak and study Latin American and Spanish literature poetry and poetics to foreground my heritage on my research There are several great e lit projects in <LOCATION>Spain Argentina</LOCATION> and other countries that are already doing the same kind of research but in Spanish and for Spanish speaking audiences I read some of them and reference them when possible And that needs to be enough because if I want to be effective as a scholar I need to focus on the research I m passionate about which is not necessarily on my ethnic cultural or national heritage I m Puerto Rican on my own time and because I live in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> present year excepted it is effortless That is a different context from a Puerto Rican in the U S Another context as my year as a Fulbright scholar in Digital Culture in <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> draws to an end I read this comment thread and see absolutely legitimate concerns voiced by scholars of an extraordinarily diverse <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> But with distance comes the sense that this conversation is occuring within the context as a very American discourse bracketed because <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is a very large continent and even North American tends to subsume <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> s own identity under the discourse of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and excludes its territories in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> and the world is a very large place During this year I have had conversations with scholars who have expressed that they and their institutions prefer not to use American software because it is too culturally specific Yet is it unproblematic for me to go about waxing eloquent about the latest DH product to emerge from a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> institution I along with <PERSON>Alex Gil</PERSON> and others brought a THATCamp Caribe to my home institution UPR Mayag ez yet I didn t see a single colleague from the <ORGANIZATION>Estudios Hisp</ORGANIZATION> nicos department Were they resisting digitality or colonization We should recognize the diversity ideologies and social concerns expressed or not in digital technologies and who better than humanists to attune others to these concerns And we need to be attuned to scholars who are researching these issues in order to recognize and address these issues in our work But we also should recognize that other scholars may not be interested in engaging in cultural critique in their own research which doesn t make them any less fill in the blank And we shouldn t forget the cultural contexts from which our conversation arises image heatherfroehlich 13 May 2013 at 9 37 am Reply Thank you <PERSON>Leonardo</PERSON> for pointing out the overwhelmingly North American discourse here this has been a recurring concern of mine as I read through this thread I also note that many of the active members of this discussion are American based men which also raises some flags for me and hopefully have for others This is not to point fingers but rather to suggest that perhaps the people we should be actively seeking out for opinions are not yet here Much earlier someone suggested that English as a dominant mode of discourse might be exclusionary which I completely agree with but I also want to point out that perhaps the digital humanities whatever that is and I make no claims of defining that here is merely following the predominant lingua franca of the academy This in some ways is severely limiting the output we could be doing as digital scholars there already are very effective annotation schemes for English it would be a far more worthwhile endeavor to put energy towards the creation amp implementation of a similar annotation schemes for non English languages Wonderful as it is to have these sorts of resources available for English speaking cultures imagine what we could do with resources for other languages though this will require some very careful handling to ensure that we are not imperalizing our own perspectives on someone else s cultural artifacts We don t need another digital <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> but we could use a digital <PERSON>Les Miserables</PERSON> for example I ve found in doing my personal flavor of digital humanities work large scale text analysis is that the ability to uncover some lesser known authors who may have been excluded from the canon because of race gender class or one of any other intersecting identities is one of the most exciting things about this kind of work <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> work is most successful when returning to close reading and placing these lesser known contributors to the forefront of our findings gives them a voice and a context they have previously been lacking I can only hope that as we continue to strive for a digital version of the humanities we strive equally to avoid whitewashing for convenience s sake we don t know who this person is so we ll ignore them image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 05 am Reply This is a great comment and at the risk of continuing to talk too much on this board I think it important to expand a bit on a point I hope to write up more thoroughly which is that when we expand not just to multilingualism among imperial majority languages French Spanish Italian Mandarin Japanese Russian Hindi Tamil Arabic Swahili even Quechua but to minority indigenous and endangered languages the question of what counts as DH and why something should be labeled as DH becomes extremely vexed To keep to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> but turn to the indigenous aka <ORGANIZATION>First Nations</ORGANIZATION> people of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> most of the major <ORGANIZATION>First Nations</ORGANIZATION> groups now maintain rich community governmental websites with a great deal of information on history geography culture and language a lot of what might go into at least the archive if not the tool version of DH type 1 But none of this work or little of it is perceived or labeled as DH particularly as Type 1 one of the earliest DH projects I worked on was the Cree language site http www eastcree org cree en and I have had trouble getting this recognized as DH and for a lot of reasons have stopped trying To my mind in many ways these are better than archives because they are the marks of living communities using any form of communications to keep themselves active and alive It would make DH look a lot less parochial and majority culture oriented if this stuff counted as DH but it s hard to see how it would benefit the communities themselves This is one of the deep cruxes that DH as a label has created for itself it needs this material in order to de colonize itself but taking that material in looks like a colonizing gesture one that is meant to benefit us

<PERSON>Alan Liu</PERSON> broke down much better We are at a threshold point I think where we can start building a comparative institutional and extra institutional analysis that spans the globe In the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> we share <PERSON>Keguro</PERSON> s broad view of the production of knowledge in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> Most of the researchers and artists I know and break bread with in <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> have day jobs Banking and industry are prominent ones for some reason This should put in perspective the anxieties about the crisis of the humanities in the North West Mostly because I see the humanities survive everyday in less than ideal conditions carried on by displaced professionals and non professionals alike That said survival and full steam ahead are two very different affairs The goal my dream at least is to see the work of the humanities well remunerated in sustainable and equitable ways everywhere In that world where I grew up the brutal industrial complex rhetoric of Andrew and <PERSON>Ian</PERSON> to some extent resonates more than our concerns about race gender disability and sexuality among those who are exploring technology for the humanities I will use that open source technology does not necessarily come accompanied by I m not sure about the assumptions of this technology But I DO want to encourage the work of those anywhere who go after the poetics of everyday and rarified systems With that goal in mind I think we should not confuse the rhetoric of realism with the real power of poetics to inform our praxis Many of the concerns here are internal to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> politics of diversity and fail to universalize The word marginal as it has been used here for example gravitates towards that context That s ok but bears reminding In the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> lies on the margins pesky or useful depending on the occasion Even in that <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> right next door <LOCATION>Washington Heights</LOCATION> the center seems to be elsewhere DH seems to have a center inasmuch as we refer to the band of cousins who memed the hell out of the words The development of technology for broadly humanist purposes is the global affair of tinkerers and pirates that the meme will have to adapt to Be under no illusions that the babel of tenure structures institutional support and the more common extra institutional activity will leave the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> intact Accommodez vous de moi Je ne m accommode pas de vous At <ORGANIZATION>Global Outlook Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> we are hoping to net these centers and hopefully push the ADHO and DH more broadly beyond its current confines while organizing <LOCATION>South South</LOCATION> communities of mutual support and dialogue The center cannot and does not want to hold We are already starting to learn enormously about the different

conversation has developed around the very issues that are central to our mission I m always struck by the insistence that DH is is somehow automatically or necessarily cultural and I find that to be a specious claim DH writ large tends to spend a lot of time writing about itself and constructing its genealogies it is well theorized At times it seems like the tendency for reflectiveness within DH is offered as evidence of its cultural inclinations However well theorized does not necessarily mean cultural Case in point in <ORGANIZATION>Matthew Gold s Debates in Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> has a section called Theorizing the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> and another one called Critiquing the Digital Humanities How curious that race and disability fall under Critiquing along with <PERSON>Amy Earhart</PERSON> s article under Practicing the <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> We might consider why work addressing such categories falls under Critiquing and Practicing but not Theorizing or even Defining In a collection that has the potential to be so definitive for DH it s interesting that those cultural sorts of contributions are positioned as Critiquing it certainly makes an impression about the relative position of race and disability within DH Identity politics can be useful here given how significant the categories we inhabit are to how we view and construct the world and in turn to the scholarship we produce Consider who is doing that theorizing and the very narrow demographic profile of what we might call a DH vanguard To me as a woman of color and as someone deeply invested in postcolonial studies and minority discourse in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> it seems the argument that DH is necessarily cultural is a luxury and not a luxury that I have Without the kinds of engaged cultural critiques that we are proposing and ones proposed by TransformDH and by other scholars deeply invested in questions of culture and DH

scholars promote this important work On the other hand I have to echo what <PERSON>Leonardo Flores</PERSON> said up above To what degree are the issues being mentioned here not only American centric but conditioned by the digital humanities as a buzzword Other disciplines concerned with digital studies computers and writing media studies computer mediated communication internet studies have a long history of the kinds of critical engagement being mentioned here And certainly few fields that engage in that critical work expect all of the scholars within the field to participate in the same kind of analysis Do we run the risk of repeating scholarship simply because digital humanities is in the title To this end I repeat some of <PERSON>Kimon Kermandes</PERSON> s concerns about the term digital humanities from the most recent issue of The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy the term remains too contested too fractured and too frequently held up as a banner for radical change to be safe enough in the development of digital practice across an entire institution and with a wide range of constituencies Because of its connections to such particular ideologies it can become one of those dangerous flashpoints that inadvertently turns people away from a project that is focused more on the evolution of humanities methodologies and forms of practice than a radical dissolution and reconception of humanities research If we think about DH as a radical dissolution of traditional humanities practice cultural studies historicism then of course these critiques make sense If on the other hand DH is simply seen as the addition of new methodologies to academic traditions that are already taking place the critique seems not so different from broader cultural insights about digital technology that have been central to forms of digital studies from the past few decades I m thinking for example about the work done on Universal Design by the EdTech field the many connections between the rhetoric of technological interfaces and race and gender in Computers and Composition and the wide ranging discussion of the complexities of intercultural communication in

although I wish I had time to develop several especially in response to some of specific points and challenges being made It is this critics of DH 1 to use <PERSON>Ramsay</PERSON> s recent category honestly and deeply believe following <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> that politics defines the horizon of interpretation of anything and everything and more specifically that race gender class identity defines the horizon of politics The problem is that this is a frame within which no successful discourse is possible if by success we mean some form of intellectual agreement or social accord No one can win an argument about identity and no one can escape a conversation about it without being accused It is very much like a game of tag This is not necessarily a bad thing but there is another view of interpretation out there that one must juxtapose to <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> s the machine is the horizon of interpretation and the abstract machine as represented by computation provides a deep and rich source of reflection a meta discourse a la <PERSON>Gregory Bateson</PERSON> that can allow us to play out the politics of identity in a new and perhaps more fulfilling way In this view politics is as <PERSON>Hobbes</PERSON> argued just another discourse that emerges from a special kind of machine society I like to imagine DH 1 as a kind of post anthropological anthropology something in line with <PERSON>Levi Strauss</PERSON> s remark that the ultimate goal of the human sciences to be not to constitute but to dissolve man The machine is not pre interpretive but it does wonderfully blur the boundaries between nature and culture causality and meaning and it provides a way out the klein bottle of identity talk So there is nothing inherently at odds between these two discourses the embeddedness of computation in culture is not at issue What is at issue is whether the discourses of an <PERSON>Adorno</PERSON> or a Butler can be transposed and slotted into to the area of computation and conduct business as usual I do not believe they can and this I believe is something like what Type I digital humanists have in mind when they resist the charges of Type I digital

<PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 9 47 am Reply This is quite a good assertion of what I would call exactly the view that concerns me most Coupled with some serious dismissals of the project of literary studies as most understand it no successful discourse is possible no one can win an argument about identity we have the view that the abstract machine allows us to play out the politics of identity in a new and perhaps more fulfilling way Had this view come out of cultural studies discourse were there a rich history of theoretization of it along the lines <PERSON>Anne Balsamo</PERSON> indicates above it might have more credibility But there is very little of this with the possible exception of some cyberfeminist discourse like <PERSON>Donna Haraway</PERSON> but I don t think even she would agree with the sentiments expressed here As it is there is a rich theoretical history indicating much the opposite in which I d include my own work as well as that of many others including <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> himself suggesting that the abstract machine has always been with us and has never on its own without the kind of serious restraining work suggested by <PERSON>Amanda</PERSON> done anything but work to concentrate and expand on power that already exists The computer does not provide a way out of the <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> bottle of identity talk and to the degree that it does that way out aims toward just the colorblindness others have written about There is no way out of the politics of the world that has gotten us where we are except by dealing with it head on The quest for a way out is deeply troubling it seems to me not conceptually distinct from <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> s original term of refuge image <PERSON>Rafael Alvarado</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 05 am Reply I am glad that I have articulated the position well enough to draw out from you some of the issues that most concern me at least regarding what I will call the naive poco critique of DH 1 Most troubling is the genealogical card check had this view come out of cultural studies No the position has nothing like this degree of ideological purity In reality practitioners of DH 1 trace a variety of genealogies in my own case it s cultural anthropology which has never needed the support of cultural studies having invented and developed the concept of culture and the critique of practical reason in some many ways Also troubling is the doctrinaire treatment of the history of the abstract machine concept It is easy to say that it has always been with us but this is retroactive land grabbing Turing is among the first to grasp it in the sense that folks in humanities computing have found compelling but <PERSON>Leibniz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lovelace</PERSON> are interesting in this sense as well Finally I also find troubling the assertion that we are stuck with what I consider to be a tedious and failed discourse regarding the political Politics is not the horizon and by insisting that it is so you cut off human creativity and the potential to develop resources to resist the political when it goes bad image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 26 am You left out the word discourse My point is not ideological purity tests it is that DH as a practice of English does not have the written theoretical argumentation to stake out the position you are articulating As I read it you are affirming <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith</PERSON> s original statement and disagreeing with her you think it is a refuge and that s good I think it s important for people to hear that I ll presume your statements about the abstract machine are directed at the genealogy I provide in some detail in my book where it s clear that I find the Leibniz Turing version extremely doctrinaire a canard even and tied very directly via figures like Hobbes to a specific high rationalist and in the Western tradition deeply conservative politics image <PERSON>Rafael Alvarado</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 39 am Re your comment below First DH is not a refuge it s just a more interesting conversation Second I do find your work compelling but I disagree with your conclusions Having ventured from literary criticism into social science you must expect that social scientists will question such direct causal relations between intellectual ideas and political positions And you must admit that any attempt to directly link the possession of an ontological claim with a political position will strike many as ideological purity testing It is the very essence of the inquisitional style to force these linkages image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 50 am Who has ventured from literary criticism into social science this is a conversation about <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities</ORGANIZATION> it s pitched as about the Humanities Again rather than ideological purity tests I was asking the question what humanists have articulated the position you describe about identity politics and race class gender studies especially humanists not directly invested in the project of Type 1 DH This is not a question of ideology it s a question of discipline and of history If DH has developed its own internal account of these topics one that does not have significant uptake in the rest of the humanities it seems deeply incumbent on it to be able to articulate to other humanists why it does not constitute a turning away from the concerns shared by most non DH humanists image <PERSON>Rafael Alvarado</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 11 11 am If you make claims about the social consequences of cultural logic then in my view you are doing social science But let s leave that to one side I agree that the view that I expressed has not been articulated I am referring to the spirit of DH as I have known it for twenty years It has not been fully articulated and perhaps it should be But your concerns sound so officious as if DH to have any legitimacy has to show its papers to the Ministry of Cultural Studies That is what I object to that we are somehow beholden to this particular discourse When you say that it seems deeply incumbent on DH to be able to articulate to other humanists why it does not constitute a turning away from the concerns shared by most non DH humanists you write as if there are a clear set of concerns there and you are waiting with your foot tapping for proof that DH is part of the group But no one has an obligation to report in this manner unless one finds it compelling and interesting to do so I don t want to come off as dismissing the concerns of DHpoco or of cultural studies but I do find this requirement to participate in a particular conversion a bit chilling We will have this conversation we are having it but it will not succeed under the shadow of ethical accusation and moral scandal that seems to characterize your criticisms of DH and I say this fully agreeing with your recent criticisms of DH having two conflicting meanings image <PERSON>Brian Lennon</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 08 am Reply I have to agree wholeheartedly with <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> s comments here <PERSON>Alvarado</PERSON> is misrepresenting the spirit of <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> s thought and its place in recent intellectual history As for the partition suggested by the statement there is nothing inherently at odds between these two discourses I also see there the escape attempt described by <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith</PERSON> in her words at the head of this thread image <PERSON>Rafael Alvarado</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 23 am Reply Well I think <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> seriously mischaracterizes DH 1 here Her observation seems to be founded on a simplistic opposition between the clear and distinct world of computing and the messy world of gender and politics that is she projects this opposition onto those whom she observes But what draws people into DH is precisely the discovery that the computational is not clear and distinct that it incredibly fuzzy and interpretive and that it admits of what I call transductive plasma As such it provides a way of thinking of being without identity of what <PERSON>Simondon</PERSON> calls transduction although he misuses the word there The problem I have with the cultural studies criticisms is that they proceed from the assumption that their discourse is already suited to handle this domain that the same categories used to critique film and fascism can be applied directly to this meidium I would rather trace a geneaolgy to thinkers like <PERSON>Bateson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Suchman</PERSON> to make sense of the digital and its relation to culture and identity Is this heresy image <PERSON>Roger Whitson</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 38 am Reply I want to reiterate the question I outlined above in the context of this discussion Because I did need to mention <PERSON>Roopika</PERSON> in terms of DH Poco but I fear that my point was lost in the structure of the thread While I don t fully agree with <PERSON>Rafael</PERSON> that the machine is the horizon of interpretation rather than the political I m not sure a single horizon of interpretation is either possible or desirable I do think some of these questions can be attributed to institutional rather than purely ideological or political concerns To what degree are we defining DH in an American centric way that ignores potentially applicable work in other fields like CW CMC Media Studies New Media Studies Media Archaeology etc Further to what degree is there an assumption about DH being connected to a specific field i e literary studies or history and not others sociology anthropology etc Also what degree is the concern due to the revolutionary assertions of some of the figures w in the DH community to do the humanities in a fundamentally different way As an aside I m not saying DH essentially embodies this revolutionary discourse because not all members participate in it just that it has become tethered to this discourse There might be institutional reasons for this parallel as well i e the connection between DH II and the altac movement the exhaustion of humanities scholars trained in traditional ways that do not land them jobs etc I think we need to be honest about ourselves as a community not just on a political ideological level but also on a historical and an institutional level Pingback Ted_Underwood image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 8 24 am Reply Just to thank

<PERSON>Roopika</PERSON> and Adeline When I look at the opening quote I immediately wanted to paste in the entirety of <PERSON>Marjorie Perloff</PERSON> s essay Crisis in the Humanities Instead of the entire piece I ll settle for this paragraph It is I would argue the contemporary fear and subordination of the pleasures of representation and recognition the pleasures of the fictive the what might happen to the what has happened the historical cultural that has trivialized the status of literary study in the academy today If for an aesthete like <PERSON>Walter Pater</PERSON> art was always approaching the condition of music in our current scheme of things art is always and monotonously approaching the condition of culture Indeed the neoPuritan notion that literature and the other arts must be somehow useful and only useful that the Ciceronian triad docere movere delectare should renounce its third element delight and even the original meaning of its second element so that to move means only to move readers to some kind of virtuous action has produced a climate in which it has become increasingly difficult to justify the study of English or Comparative Literature Since I m a creative writer and lit prof who teaches a lot of poetry <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> means a lot to me as a critic My sense is that <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> would reject the word refuge and replace it with something like return But a return to what Simply a focus on poetics form rhetoric When I first started dabbling in DH work I was immediately struck by how text centered the enterprise is and that has proven very useful pedagogically especially when working with an undergraduate population who often prefer to flee the text as quickly as possible and get right to ideas in the abstract In short I m sympathetic to <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> here because I think it approaches this question in terms of embracing an interest rather than primarily rejecting something else <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> in that essay gives respect to cultural readings of works like <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> and Heart of Darkness especially as they relate to empire etc Still what <PERSON>Martha Smith</PERSON> might describe as a refuge or seemingly so I hear someone like <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> saying what s needed is a return to poetics <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> wasn t writing about DH but I imagine one thing <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> would respect about some DH tools are their ability to hone in on language aesthetics and treat a poem as a unique rhetoric stylistic artifact etc I m learning so much from reading this thread but I chafe a little bit against the notion of a refuge from a specific set of concerns largely because it might attribute an act of will where someone might just be pursuing their particular interests And having written this I can also hear the response <PERSON>Perloff</PERSON> as you demonstrate is exactly someone who would see this as a refuge I m not sure I could completely rebut that PoCo is not my area of study specialization so I really am offering this very generally image <PERSON>Michael Kramer</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 11 59 am Reply I am interested in connecting <PERSON>Anne Balsamo</PERSON> s articulation of post identity social analysis queer feminism post colonial thinking race aren t really about identities but rather about technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions such that the plentitude of what reality is gets processed to be one thing and NOT another to the current debate between <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rafael Alvarado</PERSON> about digital humanities and cultural studies I m approaching this as a cultural historian who spends a lot of time learning from cultural studies gender and sexuality studies literary studies and cultural anthropology but is not deeply embedded in any of those worlds It strikes me that <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> s articulation of one way we might think about identity in non essentialist ways in place of static identity we shift to understanding it as generated by technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions points toward a fascinating strange and intriguing alignment of cultural studies <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> is it fair to call your work cultural studies and digital humanities around conceptualizations of technologies as the means by which power operates And I mean power here in all its senses electronic material technical political epistemological ontological historical economic ecological psychological biological racialized gendered classed normalized resisted Technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions Can we go a bit more into what we mean by technologies here Is technology simply a metaphor for talking about cultural logics Is it a way of referring to machines whether abstract or material Jamesonian or Turingian Are words such as tools technologies machines precise enough for the work we need to do to better understand DH as a refuge whether that s a good or bad thing and for whom and on what terms Most of all what does it mean in the contested spaces of digital humanities to in some sense restrict technologies to digital operations alone to the workings of ones and zeroes bits and bytes on off electrical pulsations this puts me in mind of <PERSON>Tara McPherson</PERSON> s work on lenticular logics In other words I want to know more about what happens when we start to use the concept of technologies as a way of thinking about both power in the social sense and power in the epistemological sense When we come to know things through computers what different kinds of technology are at work Another observation and a few musings on it I fear this is rather abstract abstract machine and half formed but perhaps it is useful It seems to me there are really two conversations going on sparked by <PERSON>Roopika</PERSON> and <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> s open thread One is about inclusion and exclusion in the digital humanities what projects get to count who does the speaking and what voices must they use or ventriloquize to speak Who remains silent or silenced too scared to participate The other is about trying to crack open the discourse itself of digital humanities to see what s going on inside this new vexing technology that has raised so many hopes and hackles in equal measure These two matters inclusion exclusion and discourse are of course utterly connected The challenge we face is how to move between the two On the first count we must confront the static identities that are present named or unnamed how do we confront these and redress the injustices they create On the second count we need to grapple with the underlying overlording forces into and out of which those static identities arrive as if fully formed The deeper question being debated here however is how the surface appearances of identity and the deeper logics producing them being produced by them interact And this relationship can perhaps be better understood by grappling more with what we mean when we use the term technologies For instance there is a way in which the debates about digital humanities tend to break down into binaries who s in who s out Type I vs Type II etc What I wonder about is whether the digital has intensified thinking in binaries It s either binaries or fluidity Two sides or rhizomes As a technology at the material level why is it that digital code asks us indeed seems to require us to toggle between either putting things and people into binaries or imagining them in endless networks of decentered fluid entanglements Is this all we have at our disposal as our technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions What else might we discover invent render produce foster join imagine This goes to a deeper issue technology haunting the debate here What are the precise links between the material qualities of the digital and the intellectual ideological logics of social relations Is the link direct Homological Oppositional A correlation A horizon An organization Is there no link at all Is there a hyperlink here When we think through binary code does it render everything around it into binaries of a static nature or can it crack open the world into more fluid possibilities Do we want that fluidity or not What would it mean Is there something else to imagine and enact here in place of either static binaries or endless fluidities These are but some queries some terms for searching more deeply into what the technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions are exactly when it comes to debating the stakes of digital humanities <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> image <PERSON>Andrew Keener</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 12 47 pm Reply Very thought provoking Michael Your thoughts here on <PERSON>Balsamo</PERSON> s technologies of thinking of processing and of making distinctions suggest to me a series of ways to address different varieties of technologies and their different kinds of materiality In particular I m reminded of the notion of a technology of the self which <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> articulated and pressed upon toward the end of his life so early 80s It isn t difficult to find obvious and materialized definitions of technology around you name some of them here and I was also thinking about earlier technologies including the printed book and the manuscript codex But <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> s technology of the self which harkens back to a idealized technique of classical era meditation and self reflection seems related to the ideological and contemplative possibility that you and <PERSON>Balsamo</PERSON> are gesturing toward here especially if mobilized towards purposes in queer theory <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> saw this notion and its parallel concept of askesis as a kind of intellectual commitment that sought not to discover but rather to invent ways of being this includes the improbable of course that he mentions specifically in the Friendship interview This would emphasize not a community but rather the self as the presumably ethical center of humanity This is a haphazard suggestion on my part but I think <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> s fluid use of the word technology uttered in an era when the history of the book was just finding its legs may occupy a useful position in this conversation It s been remarked that <PERSON>Foucault</PERSON> s perspective is shortsightedly Eurocentric so there s that problem But one might still usefully engage his notion of invention and a manner of being that is still improbable in conjunction with the traditionally material notion of technology in reference to DH practice image <PERSON>Aaron Kashtan</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 12 04 pm Reply Another way in which class and race intersect with the digital humanities is in terms of who has access to DH tools and to the ability to engage in DH scholarship In From Gutenberg to <ORGANIZATION>Google Peter Shillingsburg</ORGANIZATION> suggests that electronic knowledge sites could be financed by micropayments a system which incidentally was tried and failed as a means of financing webcomics and that the fee would be small enough to deter only misers and the indigent 106 In saying this in such a flippant way he s ignoring the fact that a large number of grad students are indigent And this relates to the larger point which <PERSON>Shillingsburg</PERSON> admits but doesn t fully explore the implications of that because of the high cost of such knowledge sites they will tend to be centralized in the largest libraries and universities Does this mean that students and faculty at smaller institutions and community colleges will be left behind I know that people like <PERSON>Anne McGrail</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Berg</PERSON> have been doing interesting things

Kramer</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 12 32 pm Reply Right so many comments later I forgot your initial positioning of the open thread Historical forgetting Humanities computing as part of a sort of conservative move back to the text in literary studies and to narrative in historical writing and to aesthetics in philosophy after the feeling that cultural studies had reached a dead end after the culture wars and related dreams of socialism a dead end after 1989 That d be one way not the only way of historicizing what <PERSON>Martha Nell Smith</PERSON> is talking about I d wager based on the responses by many of those involved in humanities computing that they didn t see it feel it this way for the most part But it could well have been part of underlying logics of the digital turn The way in which new technological vistas TEI information superhighway etc collided with feelings of political and intellectual exhaustion and hopes for revival within academic political apparatuses <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> image <PERSON>Jacque Wernimont</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 6 13 pm Reply I m in full support of this discussion and I m also troubled by some of it Even if we go back to the era of humanities computing it seems a bit too easy to place a singular label on what was very varied work It strikes me that this is even more the case for DH now Part of the danger of seeing HC or DH as a field that has been a refuge from issues of gender race class sexuality is that it misses perhaps even erases a great deal of work Take for example all of the early feminist projects that <PERSON>Amy Earhart</PERSON> has drawn our attention to Or the many early e lit projects that have engaged an array of people commonly thought of as excluded from DH I worry that in our effort to highlight existing institutional pressures differential access and lack of equity we make the case too strongly and thus erase the work of those that we are hoping to support Gender has been a central issue for some of the most foundational projects the Women Writers Project and the <ORGANIZATION>Orlando Project</ORGANIZATION> are great examples do they do all that we might want now No Does that mean that we should act as if they haven t been around transforming the work of DH for at least the last 20 years I don t think so These are scholars many of them women who have been thinking hard about the relationship of tools to content Who don t think that technology is transparent Who have asked hard questions about gender sex and words markup infrastructure and transformation procedures And their work has shaped and continues to shape the field I think we do ourselves and the field a serious disservice if we write a history that says that DH or Humanities Computing hasn t been a site of thinking about gender and technology I can t speak to whether or not there are equally good examples for issues of race class sexuality etc Although I do know that I ve been following the work of people like <PERSON>Angel Nieves</PERSON> for longer than we ve been having this conversation Similarly while <PERSON>Alan Liu</PERSON> s important call to action is relatively recent his work and its deep engagement with cultural studies is as old sorry <PERSON>Alan</PERSON> as humanities computing I think the critique is important but I also want to draw our attention to the long history of the critique and to the important field changing work that has already been done To miss that history is to pretend that we re inventing the wheel all over again and to deprive ourselves of much needed support and experience image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 6 52 pm Reply 1 image <PERSON>Roger Whitson</PERSON> 13 May 2013 at 10 57 pm 1 from me too see the two comments I made above

computing projects that have focused on race class gender I would be very leery of arguing that they should be used to fuel the narrative that DH has always been cultural Many of these projects have experienced opposition from their beginnings and have not been considered humanities computing or digital humanities projects because they focus on women and gender for example Now that the DH tide is turning where big tent DH needs to incorporate cultural concerns as many people have noticed I fear that these projects will be co opted into a narrative of which many of us are suspicious These earlier projects were hard won battles But whether or not they should be used to claim that DH has always been open to these issues is another point that needs to be teased out more finely image <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> 14 May 2013 at 11 50 am I am really limiting my comments here in respect of <PERSON>Heather</PERSON> s very accurate comment but while I agree with both <PERSON>Jacque</PERSON> s and <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> s points let me also stick up here for a second for the view which I suspect you will agree with that I don t see postcolonial studies theory in DH as solely and maybe not even mostly a question of who is represented in archives and tools or who is making the tools There are deeper questions about orientations theories technologies identities and many other topics many of them named here that postcolonial theory asks us to keep out in the open to keep open and to reflect on in our research and teaching How to keep those questions open while engaging with digital technology in any number of ways seems to me a topic that needs much more discussion from a very wide group of contributors and I think we are seeing the beginnings of it right here image <PERSON>Jacque Wernimont</PERSON> 14 May 2013 at 1 26 pm I agree with you both <PERSON>David</PERSON> and <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> I don t want to argue that DH has always been cultural I m more inclined to follow <PERSON>Jaime Skye Bianco</PERSON> s suggestion that This DH Is Not One and recognize that a myth of a unified field is just that a myth My turn is then to recognize the genealogies that do exist where they exist even as we challenge the erasures and exclusions This would include acknowledging the pressures that those early projects scholars faced in the work of writing their histories <PERSON>David</PERSON> you re absolutely right that this isn t a numbers game and your point is well taken image <PERSON>Ted Underwood</PERSON> 14 May 2013 at 3 25 pm 1 to <PERSON>Jacque</PERSON> s reply here In fact I d put this a bit more strongly I m not convinced that DH names a definable field at all and thus not convinced that it matters much to decide whether it has always been cultural I tend to see DH as a name for a fuzzy zone of overlap between a lot of different projects and disciplines I find it hard to make any meaningful generalizations about it

please go easy on me it s been a while since I ve read Fanon The idea of using code or more generally tools like ArcGIS to dismantle the structures that these things were created to support and extend

British the British But I m less sure about or familiar with the code layer than I am with the soft fleshy layer of DH and programming more generally A long time ago I had the chance to sit in a meeting with the CEO CFO and COO of a <ORGANIZATION>AAA</ORGANIZATION> gaming company and the <ORGANIZATION>COO</ORGANIZATION> was regaling the group with his dream game he thought it was possibly to make horribly mundane tasks like assembling and packing boxes at <ORGANIZATION>UPS</ORGANIZATION> into a game with game like elements This was long before gamification was a term but the idea that he wanted to use gaming elements in this way where the menials were tricked into being more productive by taking advantage of lessons learned in the production of entertainment software always stuck with me This kind of rhetoric in the deployment of public facing software has power rhetorics embedded in it It s typical in my experience for designers and developers to refer to dumb users who have no attention span who need to be tricked into using something or who would not understand the inner workings of their software Collaboration as colonization is real and I think we could look at local decolonization as a counterpoint to the broad theoretical issues brought up here The demystification of programming at the individual level among humanities scholars and through them to the larger community is one of the great services of digital humanities scholarship But it can t happen unless the professor of literature or graduate student in Classics who is working alongside a software engineer or less credentialed developer like myself understands how code works so she can understand when the explanation she s receiving is more a reflection of the biases of the coder and not a reflection of the structure of the code tool language Finally it s been my general experience that <PERSON>Ben Schmidt</PERSON> s <ORGANIZATION>Digital Humanities Using</ORGANIZATION> tools from the

could mark a break from previous struggles over identity and identity politics That these should be understood more as new moves within the terrain of identity formation transformation narrativization and agency and structure in conflict alignment with each other Debates about identity and post identity social analysis aside I am wondering about if and or how we might utilize the term technology analytically to pivot between what <PERSON>Ernesto Priego</PERSON> describes as critique of DH and application of DH Does the term if developed into a more robust one allow us to get into that space between thinking about DH in new ways and doing DH in new ways To me they really are connected in crucial but easy to miss ways Since I m not positioned within the poco cultural studies world institutionally I m not as invested in the debate about identity vs post identity politics though I recognize the profound intellectual value of that debate in all its provoking of anxiety and its emphasis on how we might better talk about power identity social production etc I think that your response to <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> s comments does offer enormous opportunities for DH work to be

adelinekoh 14 May 2013 at 11 48 am Reply Thanks for this <PERSON>Sangeeta</PERSON> I appreciate your point that strategic essentialisms are sometimes important and useful But my reading of <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> s comment is not that she s advocating a post identity form of analysis but to remind us that identity goes beyond the marked forms of the body I am reminded for instance of <PERSON>David Theo Goldberg</PERSON> s notion that the concept of race is best understood through how it is signified through the various discourses and practices that signify it rather than in isolated racial markers that are tied to identity <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> s post makes a useful and important point in my view image <PERSON>Michelle Moravec</PERSON> 14 May 2013 at 11 54 am Reply re these themes I cannot recommend highly enough <PERSON>Katie King</PERSON> s new book Networked Reenactments image heatherfroehlich 14 May 2013 at 4 22 am Reply Yesterday evening 6pmGMT I gave a quick eyeball through this thread and found that the ratio of men to women commenting was nearly 2 1 not considering repeated commenters I m not going to do it again but someone else is welcome to I just want to point out that it s worth mentioning that in a discussion of gender amongst other things there seems to be a gendered imbalance as to who s talking Earlier in the thread I suggest that the people whose voices we desperately need to hear aren t present and I want to reiterate that but with the emphasis of access this time In the digital humanities we constantly talk about the importance of open access and the idea of build it and they will come But this presumes that everyone has access to our digital realm which is wholly untrue We have been making some big assumptions about class in saying that Everyone has access maybe everyone has a computer these days but certainly not everybody has a computer that can handle the minimum requirements to run some seemingly basic software packages simultaneously <ORGANIZATION>Digital</ORGANIZATION> work requires digital training which requires funding to achieve Interestingly I m seeing amp feeling a larger and larger divide between the North American model of digital humanities and the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> model of digital humanities making this gap even more difficult to bridge <PERSON>Jacque Wernimont</PERSON> makes an excellent point above about gender being a central issue to digital projects from the early days of humanities computing But we re still working on gender cf this recent change in the TEI standards for gender http sourceforge net p tei feature requests 425 from last month We are so far away from solving this issue that we re not touching some of the others because they are as yet too complex to cleanly disambiguate even gender requires making some confidence decisions and sticking to them <PERSON>Melissa Rodgers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amanda Phillips</PERSON> also above make excellent points about whiteness which we should be revisiting closely when we begin to think about who we are doing our digital work about and how we are going about it image <PERSON>Jacque Wernimont</PERSON> 14 May 2013 at 8 57 am Reply <PERSON>Heather</PERSON> you re absolutely right about access It s one of the many dark sides of DH that needs to be addressed I d add to your point that even if we supposed that access were universal design targets an ideal user and there is very little design that seeks a user who is not a white male teen I find <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> s critique of modernist interface and design helpful for thinking through the biases embedded in a singular notion of good design Thanks also <PERSON>Heather</PERSON> for directing my attention to the thread with <PERSON>Melissa</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amanda</PERSON> I had missed it in the first reading Pingback Going Strong dhpoco Open Thread on Race Class Gender Sexuality Disability in DH Diaspora Hypertext the Blog image Ernesto Priego ernestopriego 14 May 2013 at 9 51 am Reply It is exciting to see more than a hundred comments here It s been done but once again thanks to <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> for posting this and opening it up for discussion The first thing I want to say is that whoa one needs time and the right setting to sit down and go through this discussion and reply as one would like too thoroughly including correct references and hyperlinks engaging respectfully with the different points of view remembering people s names etc That in itself is a kind of privilege I once published a post on U of Venus Inside Higher Education that was inspired by <PERSON>Spivak</PERSON> s Death of a Discipline which is on comparative literature but I thought then it could also be used to engage in debates around the theory and practice of the digital humanities My post asked if the subaltern could tweet By this I meant that under represented voices often have to face much more obstacles than well represented voices in online and academic discourse I agree with several different aspects of what several people have expressed here I also second those who have pointed out that a mere eyeballing of the names commenting here is indicative of the state of this particular debate If I am allowed a quick informal opinion I would say that no if you build it they will not come one needs to build the thing and also build the community They will not come because you have built it It will be fully built until they come and they inhabit it Even though I am sick and tired of the definitional debate I have to say I like this metaphor of building when speaking of the digital humanities I echo what others have said apologies if I don t name you personally and link to you directly here if I say there I believe there is a difference between the need to interrogate the discourse of around in on inside outside the digital humanities and technology in general and the need to do something with those technologies for research They are indeed not mutually exclusive but there can come the point in which they need to be distinct activities A simile might be useful Often the academic critique of say colonialist representations of the Other and the act of creating colonial representations of the Other are clearly distinct One is performed by the cultural scholar the latter by the film maker photographer advertising agency It is possible to create representations that are critical of those colonialist represenations and indeed address in practice the need to interrogate colonialist represenations and in so doing offer an example of how to do it differently ethically better I suppose the same happens with the digital humanities we can spend the rest of our days hopefully with funding we have obtained to do so critiquing discourse or practices and calling for the need to do engage with digital technologies differently This activity it seems to me requires a different kind of investment than that of working directly with those technologies no matter how imperfect This is indeed a dilemma because many of us are very much aware of the in built discourses in the technologies systems structures superstructures but at the same time we face the danger of then not engaging with them at all If we take the critique to its ultimate circumstances we wouldn t even dare to invest our time in leaving a comment here using these specific technologies that require such a long set of often uninterrogated a prioris It might be that the critique of the digital humanities has come too early before we have even begun to understand what they can be I am not saying this critique is unnecessary On the contrary It is What I guess I am trying to say is that the much needed so called postcolonial critique of the digital humanities is in fact not different from the critique we all need to make of the whole academic endeavor This also means realising that sometimes these debates reflect a <LOCATION>USA</LOCATION> centrism which can be alienating for those of us outside the everyday practicalities of the USAmerican Higher Education system Deep down what I perceive is a general dissatisfaction with the to many of us painfully obvious lack of equality of opportunity in academia in general and even more in the digital humanities given that in most cases significant funding and infrastructural support is needed to get a project center up the ground From a non USAmerican perspective it seems that suddenly DH became this trendy panacea making some people feel included and many others excluded Those excluded are not happy Once again this is not specific of DH So the question is where do we go from here I believe there is room from all the different approaches The fact some people are busy doing text encoding does not mean they are not sensitive to the discursive formations that govern most code Needless to say these are personal opinions expressed quickly I may be entirely wrong and anyone is always already entitled to disagree image Ernesto Priego ernestopriego 14 May 2013 at 10 19 am Reply Apologies for all the typos I also

comment on building in the digital humanities image <PERSON>Sangeeta Ray</PERSON> 14 May 2013 at 11 21 am Reply I am sorry I cannot participate more fully in the debates about DH except in a general fashion But first I believe we should parse some of the issue that have arisen here One is the concern with representation in terms of numbers How many men work in DH versus women how many men are participating here instead of men how many are people of color how many are queer etc Two There is a concern about representation in terms of who is representing or standing in for whom Once again <PERSON>Spivak</PERSON> s distinction between <LOCATION>Vertretung</LOCATION> and Darstellung Can the Subaltern Speak would be useful here Third is a question of tools itself In many ways this reminds me of the much much earlier question that haunted academia in the mid eighties with a difference of course as to who does theory who applies theory what counts a theory can we topple the master s house with the master s tools etc Thinking here about <PERSON>Barbara Christian</PERSON> s Race for Theory and the debates that ensued and the dismissal of that And as a counterpoint to Christian one can turn to <PERSON>Chela Sandoval</PERSON> s Methodology of the Oppressed that shows how western high theory can be productive to think with when engaged with questions of the other and minority formations Fourth and I think this is of great concern to me In what ways is Postcolonial itself differently differentially engaged positioned here vis a vis engagements with a nationally based <LOCATION>US UK</LOCATION> etc issues of color race ethnicity sexuality As those of us who have practiced poco for a while now we know how we have been used and been complicit with functioning as an alibi for race in academia While I am happy to be counted as one of Bell Hooks Third World Diva Girls the point she makes in that early essay can be useful to think about the relationship between <PERSON>Poco</PERSON> and other minority formations Fourth It is interesting to me that the question has not been framed as the relationship between DH and Minority Discourse formations here Thinking through minoritization a la <LOCATION>Delueze</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Guattari</PERSON> again a whole history here thinking about the 2 early issues of Cultural Critique in the mid 80s could produce for a productive discussion rather than in terms of say a cultural studies approach Fifth questions of critical genealogy is so necessary here not just in DH but in what i would call Minority Discourse so that we do not have to reinvent the wheel every time a field is called upon to think about itself as a refuge from engagements with questions of the other Some are some are not and some could be or become How we tell our stories is significant in the production of genealogies Why Stories Matter by <PERSON>Claire Hemmings</PERSON> is one good example There are other examples that one could use from QueerTheory stories that are very divergent say <PERSON>Weigman</PERSON> s Object Lessons Orgasmology by <PERSON>Annamarie Jagos Munoz</PERSON> Cruising Utopia and <PERSON>Halberstam</PERSON> s Queer Art of Failure No story is complete and critiques are important Think here about the contested genealogies in Poco studies starting with <PERSON>Edward Said</PERSON> gets us one story starting with <PERSON>Fanon</PERSON> gets us another and so on People in this forum who allude to 20 years of DH are saying one story a story that they feel are in danger of being erased or ignored Others are invested in a different story And finally since someone brought up Science Studies one can learn from the history of that field itself couldn t one I could name many names and books but for the purpose of brevity one could just think about <PERSON>Gyan Prakash</PERSON> s Another Reason as one intervention Thank to <PERSON>Adeline</PERSON> and

been recognized as DH work and its acknowledgment was hard won We aim to be part of a new move towards foregrounding many of the issues you mention in the hope that these questions of race class

The question of tools is an important one especially the concept of master s tools master s house Worth unpacking more who is the master what are their tools and what is their house And alongside that whose view of postcolonialism are we addressing here Are we committed to a dominant nationality or continentality of postcolonialism by virtue of the overwhelming location of commenters on this thread

<PERSON>Michael Kramer</PERSON> I spent a good chunk of my time typing a comment and what gets picked up is who I did not mention It should be obvious I did not mean to exclude <PERSON>Roopika</PERSON> or anyone else that was not the point of my message I merely looked at the byline of this post and the name I saw was adelinekoh It does not matter if the name appears elsewhere in blogging byline equals authorship I m afraid I never meant any disrespect This for me shows the levels of hyper sensitivity that can take us away from some of the issues It is as if <PERSON>Domenico</PERSON> had made an issue of his name being mis spelt in one of the reples above do we see that as an expression of the anglo centrism of DH or even DHpoco or should we just see it as a normal human typo I am very happy it was seen as the latter Moreover this is a good case in point The byline is the convention to express authorship The fact most blogging interfaces only allow as default one author will not escape to most advocates for collaborative authorship If the message we want to communicate is that we need to interrogate in practice how technologies impose certain discourses for example that authorship is not always the individual effort of a single author we need to find ways to re wire them There are WordPress plug ins that allow different authors to get their own byline like <ORGANIZATION>Co Authors Plus</ORGANIZATION> image Ernesto Priego ernestopriego 14 May 2013 at 12 25 pm Reply Awesome to see the post now includes both authors in the byline
