                <p>This case study outlines how writing for Wikipedia can benefit students in an
                    undergraduate literature class by having them undertake scholarly research, read
                    unmediated texts, and write for a real-life audience. In keeping with the
                    collaborative spirit of Wikipedia, the rubrics provided here were primarily
                    created by the class as a whole. Estill demonstrates how this assignment
                    encouraged students to question received notions of literary canon and to engage
                    critically with Wikipedia itself. Perhaps paradoxically, writing for Wikipedia
                    gave students ownership of their writing and research. Ultimately, this
                    assignment facilitated students to become experts on understudied topics and
                    helped them learn about how to do literary research.</p>

                hearing that we were going to be writing <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" onclick="window.open('http://www.wikipedia.org'); return false" class="ref">Wikipedia</a> entries. In an unscientific straw poll conducted through a show
                of hands, they all admitted to using the online encyclopedia despite their
                professors’ warnings.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e179">[1]</a> This article explores the benefits of and
                rationale for having students in a literature class write Wikipedia articles<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e193">[2]</a>: in this case, students in a third-year
                Renaissance Drama class analyzed existing Wikipedia articles about early modern
                plays, devised the rubric for how their articles would be evaluated, adopted and
                researched a play, presented their work to the class, and had the option of
                publishing their writing on Wikipedia. Ultimately, being part of the assignment
                design process and writing for a public audience led students to undertake primary
                research, to question received ideas of literary canon, and to take ownership of
                their writing. This research-based writing project relies on the digital humanities
                principle of having student-scholars leverage digital publication in order to
                participate in social knowledge creation that benefits both the students and the
                larger (often academic) community. </div>

                and case studies by professors who have successfully had students write, edit,
                expand, or translate Wikipedia articles. Professors who ask students to write for
                Wikipedia agree that having an actual public audience for their writing galvanizes
                students to research more thoroughly and to write better [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#kill2012">Kill 2012</a>].
                Recent academic interventions have focused on the need for clearly theorized and
                inclusive (of race, gender, sexuality, language, and more) approaches to this
                digital platform [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#edwards2015">Edwards 2015</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#gruwell2015">Gruwell 2015</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#koh2013">Koh and Risam 2013</a>]. Indeed, as Amanda I. Seligman argues, writing for
                encyclopedias is a scholarly and valuable pursuit [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#seligman2013">Seligman 2013</a>].
                Erin Glass points out that “the benefits of integrating NPS [Networked
                    Participatory Scholarship] in higher and graduate education are clear”; yet
                too few undergraduate literature classes take this approach [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#glass2015">Glass 2015</a>]. This case study serves as an example and template of how writing for Wikipedia
                can be productively incorporated into an undergraduate literature course.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">With over three hundred classes that have used the Wikipedia Education program, and
                many others classes that were not officially affiliated with the program that also
                wrote articles, why do we need an article about Wikipedia in the university
                literature classroom? Because discipline-based Wikipedia editing initiatives have
                been very successful pedagogically. The American Sociological Association has had
                more than 3,300 students write and edit Wikipedia articles, with three goals: “(a) to develop communication skills for general audiences;
                        (b) to discover the importance of logic, strength of argument, flow and
                        clarity of writing, and the need to cite the appropriate literature; and
                        (c) to experience the significance of accuracy in scientific writing”
                     [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#vandendorpe2015">Vandendorpe 2015</a>]. As outlined below, by writing for Wikipedia, literature students can gain
                general and transferable research and communication skills, while also considering
                the nature of digital texts (particularly hypertext and ontologies) and literary
                texts (with a focus on canon and textual studies). Furthermore, the assignment
                outlined here takes the collaborative nature of Wikipedia’s platform one step
                further: students collaboratively created their own learning goals by choosing the
                rubric on which their Wikipedia articles would be graded.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Writing for Wikipedia in a literature classroom engages students to question the
                literary canon, to consider the role of editors and editions, and to undertake
                research using primary and secondary sources. As is often the case with writing
                Wikipedia articles, this research and writing helped students develop a sense of
                mastery of the material and provided exigence for real-world writing. The stakes of
                defining a literary canon and understanding editorial interventions are always high,
                but especially so when confronting Renaissance Drama, that literary period and genre
                dominated by Shakespeare. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Almost ten years ago, Michael Best surveyed information about Shakespeare studies on
                Wikipedia, and found that, predictably, Wikipedia “does a good job of dealing with
                    the facts about [Shakespeare’s] life and works, and provides some good starting
                    places for further studies in the main articles,” yet, “as links take the intrepid explorer into the byways of
                        Early Modern minor writers the quality becomes more uneven”
                     [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#best2006">Best 2006</a>, 109, 114]. Best concludes by exhorting <cite class="title italic">Shakespeare Newsletter
                </cite>readers to “take the plunge and wade into Wikipedia waters to update,
                        improve, and extend the information Wikipedia is making available to our
                        students, and to the world”
                     [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#best2006">Best 2006</a>, 114]. A decade later, Best’s call to action still holds true: “minor
                    writers” and anonymous works are often entirely overlooked. As Matthew
                Steggle notes, “Wikipedia’s coverage of the Renaissance varies considerably
                        from article to article and even within articles”
                     [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#steggle2010">Steggle 2010</a>]. In writing Wikipedia articles about these lesser-known plays, my students
                responded to a genuine need—they were not writing the traditional paper for an
                audience of one, the professor. The professor-as-audience is, furthermore, someone
                who presumably already knows the material, whereas those reading a Wikipedia article
                are actively seeking new knowledge. Writing for Wikipedia means students have to
                consider what readers might know before coming to that particular article; they
                learn to consider audience and rhetorical situation in concrete ways that improves
                their writing.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6"> Before the digital age, scholars attempted to make early modern plays accessible by
                editing and publishing editions that would not, like the original playbooks, be
                safeguarded in rare book rooms. Digital projects followed this model, making works
                findable and searchable in even more ways. Early digital projects began with
                canonical texts: for instance, Best founded the <a href="http://www.ise.uvic.ca" onclick="window.open('http://www.ise.uvic.ca'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Internet Shakespeare Editions</cite></a> (<cite class="title italic">ISE</cite>) in 1996, to meet the demand for scholarly, edited,
                online versions of Shakespeare’s plays [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#best2012">Best 2012</a>]. In 2015, Brett D.

                    “kindred project” that moves beyond Shakespeare’s plays to
                publish works by lesser-known or anonymous authors, including John Redford, Walter
                Mountfort, and Richard Edwards [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#hirsch2015">Hirsch 2015</a>]

                the earliest and most detailed entries deal with canonical authors and plays. I
                contend that Wikipedia entries not only reflect the current literary canon but also
                help to shape it. As a first stop for undergraduates, graduate students, and even at
                times professors [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#knight2012">Knight and Pryke 2012</a>], Wikipedia offers at-a-glance
                information that can be used as a starting point: and without even a
                    “stub” (a short placeholder article that needs to be
                expanded), overlooked works are absent from the literary landscape and commonly- and
                communally-held cultural narrative Wikipedia presents.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e354">[5]</a>
                Without conscious interventions such as this that seek to expand the canon,
                Wikipedia and other digital projects will only reinscribe our existing canon [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#earhart2012">Earhart 2012</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e368">[6]</a></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7"> Many undergraduate literature students have never heard the term
                    “canon.” They have not questioned why there are entire
                courses listed in the university catalogue about Shakespeare, yet none on Ben Jonson
                or Mary Sidney. Students instinctively want to begin any written assignment with
                    “William Shakespeare is the greatest writer of English literature” (or
                words to that effect), while instructors help students see the historical reasons
                the Bard has been positioned over other writers. Finding and researching
                understudied plays for Wikipedia helped students start to question the shape of the
                English literary canon and consider how anthologies and university course catalogues
                reify canon.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e383">[7]</a>

            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8"> In the spirit of Wikipedia, students collaboratively created the rubric on which
                their assignment would be graded. I determined that a portion of their grade would
                be established by their presentations and their pre-research. The bulk of the
                pre-research was a short “Wikipedia Analysis,” where they
                analyzed existing articles about Renaissance plays and evaluated what made the
                articles most useful (see “Process Elements” in the rubric in
                Appendix A). I encouraged students to read the Wikipedia pages about the plays we
                were reading that semester. Some of the questions they considered were: “What
                    should every Wikipedia page about a Renaissance play have? What headings? What
                    information?” and “What kind of notes are most useful? What sources are
                    cited?” When prompted to suggest which articles would make good or bad
                templates, the response was almost unanimous: lots of plays we read that semester
                had strong Wikipedia pages (such as <cite class="title italic">The Spanish Tragedy</cite>
                and <cite class="title italic">A Chaste Maid in Cheapside</cite>), but <cite class="title italic">The Tragedy of Mariam</cite>, the only play we read by a female
                author, had an inadequate page. This led students to discuss the treatment of women
                writers both historically and today.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e421">[8]</a> Reading the well-written write-ups,
                furthermore, gave students valuable background information that allowed them to
                engage with the canonical texts we studied in deeper ways. Much of the information
                on a Wikipedia page about a Renaissance play will appear in a modern introduction to
                that play; reading either an introduction or a Wikipedia page can be a passive
                experience. Analyzing Wikipedia pages, however, encouraged students to think about
                the value and reasoning behind the information presented. Furthermore, as we
                discussed together in class, with its hyperlinking, Wikipedia can facilitate deeper
                research than a print introduction: students can be easily drawn into related fields
                of inquiry as they click through to new pages on (literally and figuratively) linked
                topics. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">After handing in their 300-500 word Wikipedia Analysis, students brainstormed in
                class what makes an effective Wikipedia page on a Renaissance play and what headings
                and content need to appear in the page. We grouped their suggestions into categories
                and finalized their rubric for the written component (see Appendix A). This
                assignment gave students ownership over their material in two ways: one, they were
                responsible for a play that nobody else would read; and two, they decided the
                desired outcomes for this assignment by collaboratively creating the rubric.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e431">[9]</a> Students determined that introductions
                to each play needed to contain some basic, key information (when available): the
                play’s title and alternative titles, genre, playwright(s), setting, initial
                performance information (date, company, theatre, patron, occasion), and initial
                publication information (date, publisher, location). This is the kind of information
                that students take for granted: they skim over it when reading a play’s
                introduction; they glance at it on Wikipedia. Finding this information when it is
                not made readily available, however, gave students the opportunity to undertake true
                scholarly research. Students also start to see the holes or slippages in the
                narratives we have of Renaissance theatre history: often, scholars cannot agree on
                where or when a play was first performed, let alone who wrote it.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10"> Before they could undertake their research, however, students had to adopt a play. I
                gave students a list of eighty-nine plays that had no Wikipedia pages (or, in some
                cases, stubs).<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e442">[10]</a> As their guidelines read, “There’s no Wikipedia page,
                    and you can’t read all of these... so what should you do?” (see Appendix B).
                I suggested they pick two or three plays based on their title and do a little
                research on the play. I also advised choosing a play they could access in a way they
                would feel comfortable. In order to adopt a play, each had to locate an edition:
                some chose plays that can only be found on <a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com" onclick="window.open('http://eebo.chadwyck.com'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Early English Books Online</cite></a> (<cite class="title italic">EEBO</cite>), <a href="http://literature.proquest.com" onclick="window.open('http://literature.proquest.com'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Literature Online</cite></a> (<cite class="title italic">LiOn</cite>), or in facsimile reprints of the first editions, whereas others
                opted to read plays that were recently recuperated by online publication (some
                edited, some not) in <a href="http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/emlsetxt.html" onclick="window.open('http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/emlsetxt.html'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Early Modern Literary Studies</cite></a> or Risa Stephanie

            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">As the plays my students adopted were generally under-studied, my students had to
                learn both new ways of reading and new research methods. For many, this was the
                first time facing an unedited early modern text: for students used to anthologies of
                Shakespeare, even the non-standard orthography could come as a surprise. Some
                students learned that act and scene breaks could be editorial. By comparing how
                plays have been historically treated (or ignored), my class began asking questions
                about scholarly editing, that is, about how the texts we read are mediated in ways
                we often take for granted. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Beyond reading the play itself in order to write a summary, students had to undertake
                primary research to write the introductory paragraph about their play. As we had
                established, a good Wikipedia entry always gave a play’s initial publication, and,
                when known, details about the first performance, such as the company, theatre, and
                date. I devoted an entire 50-minute class and to how to research their plays.
                Although my students undertook research using primary and secondary materials, this
                assignment did not violate Wikipedia’s “no original research”
                policy, which “all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable,
                    published source”: it did, however, challenge the standard research
                undergraduates are asked to undertake.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e515">[13]</a> I
                encouraged students to use both print tools such as the <cite class="title italic">Annals

                [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#harbage1989">Harbage et al. 1989</a>] and the <cite class="title italic">Records of Early English

                performance history).<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e552">[15]</a> All, however, learned to navigate <cite class="title italic">The Database of Early English Playbooks</cite>, and many turned

                play-texts looked like. Upon finding that we had access to three digital facsimiles
                of Samuel Daniel’s <cite class="title italic">The Tragedie of Cleopatra</cite> in quarto,
                my student who adopted this play exclaimed, “I’m going to compare all three!”
                The last portion of the research methods class was devoted to finding secondary
                sources, an important skill that would also serve them in good stead for their other
                university classes. Although scholars talk about digital natives,<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e587">[16]</a> in this class period I was reminded that
                students do not actually have an innate understanding of how to search for things
                effectively. Searching, however, is not endemic to online sources, and students
                similarly needed guidance with how to search using print sources. Showing students
                how to find the information they seek and discern its value (rather than telling
                them the answers) empowers them to come up with even more exciting research
                questions. Furthermore, these research skills are foundational to writing a
                Wikipedia article. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Equipped with the ability to use new research tools, students had two main parts of
                the assignment to complete: write the Wikipedia page, and present about their play
                in class. We all know the old adage that you learn something best by teaching. In
                this context, student presenters benefited from having an in-person audience to
                speak to as well as their online audience. As audience members, students learned
                about a variety of plays and genres that we would not have had time to all read
                together, including domestic tragedy, farce, roman history, and pastoral. Taken
                together, these presentations offered an overview of English Renaissance drama that
                no single anthology could provide. Indeed, students in this class gained a more
                realistic view of what was actually available to audiences in Shakespeare’s day, as
                well as the key genres that preceded and followed. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">For their presentations, I encouraged students not to give a plot synopsis. Some,
                however, could not resist the temptation, as they had put in quite an effort to
                learn all of the details of, in some cases, very intricate plots. Others, however,
                managed to keep to the main points we wanted to hear: the themes in the play, why
                this play is interesting (or not), and why this play has been neglected so
                    far.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e604">[17]</a> For instance, one student who
                discussed Ben Jonson’s <cite class="title italic">The Irish Masque at Court</cite>,
                taught the class about masques, those performances designed especially for the King
                or Queen; she also explained Ireland’s political turmoil in the early modern period,
                and, most importantly for this text, examined the English audience’s attitudes
                towards the Irish and the anticipated reactions to Jonson’s harsh portrayal of
                uneducated, ill-mannered, and ridiculous-accented Irish. Exploring non-canonical
                plays led to student-driven discussions that reflected on an array of primary
                sources and that truly supported classroom dialogue and critical thinking. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">During these presentations, I discovered that my students had taken the
                    “adopt” a play metaphor seriously. Some students felt
                protective of their plays and wanted to justify their play as worth studying. One
                student wrote about <cite class="title italic">Cupid’s Whirligig</cite>, a city comedy by
                Edward Sharpham that nobody reads.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e619">[18]</a> She expressed
                her shock that <cite class="title italic">Cupid’s Whirligig</cite> was not regularly
                taught or anthologized. This possessiveness, born of truly caring about the texts
                they read, was a recurring theme in the presentations. Upper-level English majors
                were, some for the first time, grappling with ideas of canonicity because they had
                identified gaps in both in the curriculum and what seems like Wikipedia’s universal
                content. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Reading non-canonical works, presenting “their” adopted play to
                the class, and writing for Wikipedia gave students an incentive to excel:
                specifically, writing for Wikipedia increased the exigency of their work, as they
                were addressing an actual lacuna. As Wikipedia advertises, writing in the classroom
                can be “the end of throwaway assignments and the beginning of <em class="emph">real-world
                        impact</em> for student editors” (emphasis in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program" onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program'); return false" class="ref">original</a>). These students created Wikipedia articles that, in some cases,
                actually contributed to a broader knowledge community.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">I qualified my previous assertion about student contributions because I did not
                require that students publish their writing on Wikipedia. Asking students to share
                their work, even pseudonymously, is an ethical quandary. Posting on Wikipedia is
                different from, for instance, our course website: on a course website, I can protect
                all of the material by requiring a password and, even if the site were open-access,
                it would not get much traffic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites" onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites'); return false" class="ref">As

                did not require them to post it to the online encyclopedia for credit.<a class="noteRef" href="estill-collaborative.html#d32504e647">[19]</a> Some students creatively formatted their word document

                anonymous play from 1632 (see Figure 1). Even though posting to Wikipedia was
                optional, about a third of my students gave it a try. Those students, on their own,

                marked as “orphans,” that is to say, no other pages linked to
                them. Even though students were not required to upload their work to Wikipedia, we
                talked about how they should categorize their plays and where their articles should
                both link to and be linked from. They had to indicate what links they would include
                even if they handed in their paper in a word document. While most students were able
                to include appropriate links, many did not understand the “categories” of articles
                on Wikipedia, nor what the benefit of linking <em class="emph">to</em> your page versus
                    <em class="emph">from</em> the page might be. Uploading new pages to Wikipedia (and
                writing as if your work were to be uploaded) leads students to consider how to
                classify information. Exploring ontologies and taxonomies—those categories that we
                apply (“1631 plays”) or sometimes choose not to apply
                    (“plays published in quarto”) when creating a Wikipedia
                page—helps students approach disciplinary knowledge systems. Wikipedia’s categories
                makes assumptions about how users will navigate the pages and what might interest
                them; Wikipedia’s explicit organization can prompt students to interrogate implicit
                ontologies in literary studies.</div>

                dozen Wikipedians read and edited the page (see Figure 5): most of the
                post-assignment edits involved normalizing the spelling to American, and, yes,
                sometimes adding or changing the categories. Beyond those Wikipedians who actively
                edited the text, there are the users who simply read this page and made no changes,
                which we cannot track. Perhaps most impressively, the most recent update to the page
                (15 November 2014, Renaissancefan) is from the same person who created it in 2012:
                no longer a student, this person is still engaging with the texts and ideas from
                their class. Although it might seem counterintuitive, writing for Wikipedia—that is,
                putting your work on the internet for all to use and change—can allow students to
                feel intellectual ownership. Renaissancefan is not just a consumer of knowledge
                shared by a professor, but an expert contributing to broader discussions.</div>

                Steggle suggests that we can perhaps better understand models of early modern
                writing by engaging with Wikipedia: <blockquote><p>
                    It is one thing to know that, in principle, Renaissance
                        drama is at home with co-authored, repatched plays; with plays that
                        plagiarize pieces of earlier plays; and with plays that change radically
                        from version to version. But to realize that we happily use Wikipedia
                        articles whose status is comparable helps us to see how well that might work
                        in practice.
                     [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#steggle2010">Steggle 2010</a>]
                </p></blockquote> We might tell students about the highly collaborative practice of writing
                early plays for a public audience; this assignment helps students engage with the
                largest collaborative writing project ever undertaken. Of course, all collaborative
                modes of writing are not the same: an early modern playwright revising an older work
                is not the same as a student contributing to Wikipedia. That said, writing for
                Wikipedia can help students think of authorship models beyond the often fallacious
                idea of the single-author-genius.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Admittedly, writing about Renaissance plays on Wikipedia is a finite project. At some
                point in the future, all the plays listed in the <cite class="title italic">Database of
                    Early English Playbooks</cite> could have complete entries. If and when that
                halcyon day comes, class projects in this field can move to new related topics that
                are not yet covered adequately, such as royal progresses and processions, acting
                companies and actors, and even manuscript sources for early modern drama. The future
                of digital pedagogy projects that promote editing Wikipedia is, at its heart, one
                that both defines and reflects future avenues for scholarship.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="estill-collaborative.html#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">This article has demonstrated the concrete benefits of having students write pages
                for Wikipedia, including self-motivated learning, improved communication skills,
                writing for a real-life audience, and undertaking scholarly research. Some of the
                benefits to writing articles discussed here are field specific, such as reading
                unedited plays, considering notions of literary canon, and exploring how and what we
                study as literary scholars. Beyond the values that Wikipedia itself touts and those
                discipline-specific skills that students gained, this assignment fosters critical
                thinking about Wikipedia itself: what’s in, what’s out, and what these bounds
                suggest about our cultural values. Learning about Wikipedia prompts students to
                question how other, sometimes seemingly monolithic, sites are conceptualized and
                created, as manifested in our class discussions. Analyzing Wikipedia also promotes
                what might be called digital civic engagement: this kind of action can help make
                digital spaces more inclusive and representative, although this is currently an
                uphill battle. </div>

                Wikipedia was best used in the pre-research phase, and not cited in the

                out of class, “this is more work than a research paper.” Yes, doing scholarly
                research, reading unmediated texts, and writing for a real-life audience is work: it
                is the work we undertake as literary scholars. As the students in my Renaissance
                Drama proved, students are eager to learn to undertake real literary scholarship
                when we offer them the chance to gain and share their expertise by writing for

                    Having students behave as experts in both the genre of writing and the topic

                    Personally, I have had students request to have their written assignments
                    removed from publicly facing websites when they went on the job market; allowing
                    students the choice to publish their work (rather than requiring it) is
                    respectful of their privacy and ability to make decisions. HASTAC (Humanities,
                    Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory) suggests that students
                    be encouraged to write under a pseudonym and not be required to publish their
                    work online because of legal ramifications, including America’s FERPA: Family
                    Education Rights and Privacy Act [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#hastac2015">HASTAC 2015</a>]. Erin Glass
                    acknlowledges that “privacy, control, and ownership” are not yet
                        “adequately addressed” in relation to online student writing [<a class="ref" href="estill-collaborative.html#glass2015">Glass 2015</a>]. Neither Glass nor this HASTAC post focuses on
                    Wikipedia, which allows students to publish pseudonymously. This assignment
                    does, however, participate in what Glass terms “Networked Participatory
