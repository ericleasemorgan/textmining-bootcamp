texts containing about 4 of all books ever printed Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively We survey the vast terrain of culturomics focusing on linguistic and

collective memory the adoption of technology the pursuit of fame censorship and historical epidemiology Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities View Full Text image Science 331 6014 Science Vol 331 Issue 6014 14 January 2011 Table of Contents Print Table of Contents Advertising PDF
