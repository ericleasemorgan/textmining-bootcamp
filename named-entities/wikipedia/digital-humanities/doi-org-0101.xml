towards automation of scientific research has recently resulted into what has been termed data driven inquiry in various disciplines including physics and biology 1 5 The automation of many tasks has been identified as a possible future also for the humanities and the social sciences particularly in those disciplines concerned with the analysis of text due to the recent availability of millions of books and news articles in digital format 6 7 bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p2 To date research into media content has been constrained by two key factors Firstly the most common form of analysis is labour intensive relying upon people to physically examine interpret or code media content 8 9 Even those studies that employ meta analysis struggle to find large sample sizes and consistent coding frames across the sample of different studies examined 10 This inevitably limits sample sizes both in terms of the range of media outlets and the time periods covered This has become particularly problematic as the range of media outlets has increased While databases exist for generating larger samples such as LexisNexis which provides a commercial database of news content available at http www lexisnexis com the analytical tools they provide are limited Secondly scholars are obliged to impose their own analytical frameworks on media content they can only find those trends or patterns that they already know or suspect are there formulate very specific assumption about these patterns and then set out to verify if they are present or not In other words these investigations are inherently hypothesis driven bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p3 Automating the analysis of news content could have significant applications due to the central role played by the news media in providing the information that people use to make sense of the world 11 Public policy makers businesses NGOs and scholars from a wide range of disciplines regularly conduct research to investigate media content The automation of content analysis is highly desirable but involves high level tasks such as detection of topic style and possibly translation Several systems have been developed for continuous media monitoring like the European Media Monitor EMM family of media monitoring applications 12 and the <PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> system 13 that have been used for detecting events spatial and temporal distribution of entities in the news etc <ORGANIZATION>Newsblaster</ORGANIZATION> 14 and NewsInEssence 15 for generating multi document summarization of news or even commercial systems like those from <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> and Yahoo We have a different goal than those media monitoring systems and that is to detect patterns that can provide some insight of the structure of the European mediasphere It is worth mentioning that datasets commonly used as benchmarks in text mining works such as <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> RCV1 RCV2 16 are not fully relevant to this project since our work is concerned with combining information from multiple sources bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p4 In this study we report what we think is the first large scale content analysis of cross linguistic text in the social sciences by deploying various artificial intelligence techniques including recent advances in machine translation 17 18 and text analysis 19 We examined the content of media outlets based in the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> what we might call the <LOCATION>EU Mediasphere</LOCATION> in order to see some of the patterns and trends that emerge We took advantage of the large scale digitisation of large sections of the mediasphere thereby opening up significant new possibilities for the analysis of global media Our approach not only allows us to examine huge samples across the mediasphere but allows the data itself to generate patterns and trends In other words this study is largely data driven and illustrative of the scale and scope of the forms of analysis our approach makes possible bookmark article1 body1 sec1 p5 We analyse 1 3 M news articles in 22 languages proving that the choice of stories covered by an outlet is significantly affected by objective national geographic economic and cultural relations among outlets and countries e g outlets from countries sharing strong economic ties are more likely to cover the same stories We also show that the deviation from average content is significantly correlated with membership to the eurozone as well as with the year of accession to the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> bookmark s2 Results bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p1 We selected the top ten news outlets established by the volume of web traffic for each of 27 <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries that have a presence online and offer their content in the Really Simple Syndication RSS feed format This provides an easy means for machines to automatically collect the content of a web site For six countries we found less than ten outlets with appropriate online presence resulting in a set of 255 outlets and from those we managed to successfully parse a total of 215 for the period of study Supporting Table S1 contains the list of news outlets The media we monitored are of various types notably newspapers and broadcast media Most of these have off line versions that is they are the websites of traditional news media In order to make them comparable we used news items that appear in the leading news feed of each roughly corresponding to the first page or the main page of the news outlet bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p2 In total we gathered 1 370 874 news items from the top stories of the top outlets of each <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> country for a period of six months from August 1st 2009 until January 31st 2010 The non English language news items 1 2 M were translated automatically to English by a system based on Moses 18 Although the method does not create human quality translations it gives sufficient quality for our purposes since the bag of words representation we use next is not affected by a possibly incorrect ordering or inflection of the translated words bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p3 The English and the translated news items were then preprocessed by typical text mining methods that include stop word removal indexing stemming and transferral to the TF IDF bag of words space 19 Any untranslated words are also removed to ensure that the similarity of two articles is not affected by the language in which they were originally written In order to allow comparable patterns of content to emerge from the data the news items of each day were linked by content to form clusters corresponding to the same story Clustering was made using the Best Reciprocal Hit method borrowed from the field of bioinformatics 20 The similarity of two articles was measured using the cosine similarity 19 Every outlet was hence associated with the set of stories it had covered in the given period bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p4 For each pair of outlets we calculated the chi square test statistic to measure statistical dependence A threshold was applied to chi square values to obtain a network of significantly correlated news outlets To investigate the underlying structure we applied a high threshold chosen to maximize the modularity 21 of the inferred network We reached a modularity of 0 93 The resulting network after removing unconnected nodes is formed of 31 connected components as displayed in Fig 1 which were found to correspond roughly to the 27 countries Given the structure of that network we calculated the probability that two outlets from the same country end up in the same connected component This probability is 82 95 and it is significant with p lt 0 001 as estimated by a randomization test permuting country labels of the outlets 1000 shuffles The software pipeline starts with the acquisition of 1 3 M articles and ends with the identification of subsets of news outlets that have a strong similarity in the kind of stories they choose to cover This could seamlessly be applied to much larger datasets bookmark pone 0014243 g001 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Figure 1 The communities of news outlets in the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> mediasphere bookmark article1 body1 sec2 fig1 caption1 p1 We created the network of the top news outlets per <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> country We connected two outlets if they reported the same stories more than expected by chance as measured by chi square testing A high threshold on the chi square results that maximizes the modularity of the network was used for the current plot This network is comprised of 147 nodes outlets and 263 edges organized in 31 communities Each outlet is coloured by the country of its origin Disconnected nodes are omitted This way the relation of the strongest connected components and countries is revealed https doi org 10 1371 journal pone 0014243 g001 bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p5 Given that the network of outlets decomposes into connected components roughly corresponding to <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries we have then explored the structure of the network of countries As for the outlets network each country is described by the set of stories that appeared in the top stories feed of the top outlets of this country Once more chi square scores were used to quantify the statistical independence of the countries in the content of their media This allowed us to identify similarities and differences between the content of news media in the 27 <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries with a resulting pattern across the <LOCATION>EU Mediasphere</LOCATION> bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p6 We explored three of the many possible factors that may affect the stories that news media choose to cover and we measured the Spearman correlation of each of these factors to the chi square scores between countries The factors we focused on are trade relations between countries cultural relations and existence of common land borders bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p7 a For trade relations we used data from <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Statistics Division Commodity Trade Statistics Database</ORGANIZATION> using the total of all trade between the respective countries in 2008 We used the fraction of the total trade of the country in question that is directed towards each other country We found significant correlation of 31 03 p lt 0 001 bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p8 b For cultural relations we used data expressed in the voting patterns of <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries competing in the Eurovision song contest from 1957 to 2003 We used the fraction of total points awarded by the country in question to each other country over the whole period of time Countries present in the voting data but not in the current <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries list were removed prior to normalization We found correlation of 32 05 p lt 0 001 bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p9 c For geographical proximity we used the proportion of length of the common land borders between countries Correlation was 33 86 p lt 0 001 bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p10 The predictability of these correlations is important for this study we would expect patterns of news content to reflect geographic economic and cultural patterns since it confirms the ability of our approach to use computer generated means to establish highly plausible patterns in news content bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p11 Next we threshold the chi square scores between countries to get a network of relations between them The threshold is chosen as high as possible while still maintaining a connected network We call this the co coverage network and we present it in Fig 2 Several expected connections between countries were found such as <LOCATION>Greece Cyprus Czech Republic Slovakia Latvia Estonia United Kingdom Ireland Belgium France</LOCATION> etc Links between countries not explained by borders trade or cultural relations could be due to other factors and are potentially the basis of further research from social scientists bookmark pone 0014243 g002 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Figure 2 The co coverage network of <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries bookmark article1 body1 sec2 fig2 caption1 p1 This is the network of the most significant relations among <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries that cover the same stories in their media The network has 27 nodes that correspond to the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> countries and 112 links between them The sparseness was chosen as high as possible with the restriction that all countries must link to at least one other country https doi org 10 1371 journal pone 0014243 g002 bookmark article1 body1 sec2 p12 If we choose not to threshold chi square scores between countries we can use non metric Multidimensional Scaling to treat these scores as similarities and embed them in a 26 dimensional space N 27 points projected in N 1 space In that space we found the centre of mass of all countries which represents the average behaviour of news content in the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> and measured the Euclidean distance of each country from that centre We found that the ranking of countries based on that distance has a significant p 0 0096 correlation of 48 94 to their year of accession in <LOCATION>EU Spearman</LOCATION> correlation As we might expect on the top of the list are the Eurozone countries presented in Table 1 We can for example see that while the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> share the same language news coverage in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> appears to be closer to an <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> norm than news coverage in the more Eurosceptic <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> By accepting some loss of information we project the countries into a two dimensional space instead of the 26 dimensional space used previously In this space we can reveal their relative positions where we expect countries that share interest in the same topics to be closer together and those with less common interests in their media content to be further apart We visualize this in Fig 3 This illustration presents another insight into the relations between media in different countries of the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> bookmark pone 0014243 g003 image thumbnail Download PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Figure 3 The co coverage map of the

article1 body1 sec3 p1 We have presented the first large scale comparative analysis of the news content of the leading <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> news outlets We have detected significant patterns and differences in news media content and have found significant relations between the content of the news media in <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> and national geographic trade and cultural relations This is the first comparative analysis of news content performed on a massive scale across 27 countries in 22 different languages and over 1 3 M articles where insights of the structure of the European Mediasphere were obtained and which was performed largely by automated means These results could not have been obtained without automated translation and clustering of news and are just examples of what can currently be achieved in the field of news content analysis by applying automated means of text processing to massive datasets bookmark article1 body1 sec3 p2 Our approach opens up the possibility of analysing the mediasphere on a global scale using automated means to identify clusters and patterns of content While this approach inevitably lacks the degree of qualitative subtlety provided by humans we believe that it is a significant breakthrough in the analysis of media content allowing for a data driven approach to social sciences and the exploitation of the huge amounts of digital data that have become available in recent years bookmark s4 Methods bookmark s4a Selection of Outlets bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec1 p1 The selection of the most influential media outlets per country among different types of media outlets is inherently difficult How can we compare the differences of impact between broadcast and printed media Since all outlets we study have online presence we used as a measure of their impact the traffic of their websites This ranking is reported by <PERSON>Alexa</PERSON> com <ORGANIZATION>Alexa Traffic Rank</ORGANIZATION> index and we collected the rank of each outlet on May 20 2009 Similar strategies have been used before in literature e g 22 bookmark s4b Machine Translation bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p1 We applied a <ORGANIZATION>Statistical Machine Translation SMT</ORGANIZATION> approach for translating the non English articles to English SMT is based on a noisy channel model 17 where a Markovian Language Model coupled with a phrase to phrase translation table are at the heart In recent years the noisy channel model has been extended in different directions The most fruitful has been the phrase based statistical machine translation PBSMT introduced by <PERSON>Koehn</PERSON> et al 23 that is based on the use of phrases rather than words We use Moses a complete phrase based translation toolkit for academic purposes It provides all the state of the art components needed to create a PBSMT system from one language to another For each language pair an instance of Moses is trained using Europarl 24 data and <ORGANIZATION>JRC Acquis Multilingual Parallel Corpus</ORGANIZATION> 25 bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p2 We translated all non English articles of the following 21 official <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> languages into English Bulgarian Czech Danish Dutch Estonian Finnish French German Greek Hungarian Italian Latvian Lithuanian Maltese Polish Portuguese Romanian Slovak Slovene Spanish and Swedish bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec2 p3 We make the working assumption that SMT does not alter significantly the geometry of the corpus in the vector space representation This is corroborated by results such as 26 a work on cross language information retrieval where bag of words representations of translated documents are successfully used bookmark s4c Clustering of news articles bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec3 p1 News articles were clustered using the Best Reciprocal Hit BRH method 20 An article i in outlet I is a BRH of article j in outlet J if a query on outlet J with article i yields j as the top hit article and the reciprocal query of outlet I with article j yields i as the top hit article As a similarity measure between two articles we adopted their cosine distance in the bag of words space This results in pairs of articles from different outlets that publish the same stories Connections of these pairs in larger components is based on the logic that friends of friends are also friends i e the pairs of articles i j and j k form the cluster i j k The advantages of this clustering method for the current problem are that a we don t need to specify the number of clusters we want to discover since it is unknown and non stationary per day and b we take advantage of the natural separation of the articles into sets of articles published in different news outlets bookmark s4d Network Reconstruction bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec4 p1 We used an approach based on chi square test statistic 27 to reconstruct the network of news outlets and observe the underlining structure The chi square test measures statistical independence between two variables In our case the two variables are two outlets and we run the test for each possible pair of outlets If a test concludes that the two outlets are not independent then we connect them with an edge otherwise we do not To measure the chi square statistic between outlet A and outlet B we count how many stories both outlets published S11 how many stories A published but B didn t publish S10 how many stories B published but A didn t publish S01 and how many stories other outlets published that neither outlet A or B published S00 Then we compute the expected counts that we would have if A and B were independent E11 S11 S01 S11 S10 N where N is the total number of stories E10 S10 S11 S10 S00 N E01 S01 S11 S01 S00 N and E00 S00 S01 S00 S10 N The chi square statistic of A and B is given by the quantity bookmark image bookmark article1 body1 sec4 sec4 p2 This quantity is associated with the probability that the two outlets being independent If it is above a threshold we consider A and B dependent and we connect them with an edge The same approach was used to reconstruct the network of countries bookmark s5 Supporting Information bookmark pone 0014243 s001 Table S1 bookmark article1 body1 sec5 supplementary material1 caption1 p1 The list of media outlets used in research The
