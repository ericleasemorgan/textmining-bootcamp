        Poemage is a visualization system for exploring the sonic topology of a poem. We define sonic topology as the complex structures formed via the interaction of sonic patterns — words connected through some sonic or linguistic resemblance —  across the space of the poem. Poemage was developed at the University of Utah as part of an ongoing, highly exploratory collaboration between data visualization experts and poets/poetry scholars. Additional details are provided in the companion paper .

          Poemage

          Poemage is open source. Please check back periodically for updates.

          Web version coming soon!

           

          Executables

			Executables are no longer supported. Please check back soon for a web version of the tool.
 If you would like to be notified when the web version is up and running, please send email to nina@cs.utah.edu.

        
        Source
Poemage was developed using the Processing language (v 2.2.1). The source code is publicly available to run in the Processing environment. The code has been tested for Processing version 2.2.1

       RhymeDesign

       As part of this collaboration we have also developed a system, called RhymeDesign, for querying complex rhyme in a poem. RhymeDesign provides the back-end for Poemage. For more information about the system, and to download the application/source, please visit RhymeDesign.org .
