                <p>This article argues that digital humanities projects can promote social change,
                    collaboration, equity, and creativity through a focus on pedagogy in the
                    undergraduate classroom. We analyze a pedagogical project that overtly set out
                    to challenge structures of power and privilege in the undergraduate classroom
                    through the use of an open-source online learning community. The Futures
                    Initiative Commons in a Box site was developed and modified by the university
                    faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students that make up the community of
                    users. This learning community invites undergraduate and graduate students to
                    become active knowledge-producers who contribute to their own teaching and
                    learning. As such, the site works to increase students’ agency and reconfigure
                    hierarchical relationships of power and knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">At its best, education catalyzes student agency, encourages critical, creative, and
                collaborative thinking, and promotes equity, even amidst conditions of widespread
                inequality and injustice. But how often are these values promoted, or even
                reflected, in our digital learning environments? As Miriam Posner argued in a recent
                keynote delivered at the Keystone Digital Humanities Conference, “For all of its vaunted innovation, the digital humanities
                        actually borrows a lot of its infrastructure, data models, and visual
                        rhetoric from other areas, and particularly from models developed for
                        business applications”
                     [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#posner2015">Posner 2015</a>]. In digital learning spaces, there is a similar problem: design often borrows
                from a traditional instructor–centered model of learning, with little room for
                collaboration among students, peer review, or opportunities for students to design
                aspects of their courses. In addition, as Audrey Watters recently argued, learning
                management systems collect massive amounts of student data that is not necessarily
                owned or protected by universities [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#watters2017">Watters 2017</a>]. While closed and
                proprietary educational technologies often maintain hierarchies between instructors
                and undergraduates and discourage creative student–driven learning, user–designed
                and student–centered digital tools can, in fact, redistribute power and contribute
                to the much larger project of social change. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In this essay, we examine how an open-access online learning space can work to
                enhance the egalitarian and participatory nature of an educational community. Based
                on our experiences creating a customized online network to advance the pedagogical
                goals of a course taught at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York
                (CUNY), “Mapping the Futures of Higher Education,” we
                will consider two questions: 1) What might a digital humanities project look like if
                you start with the educational needs and desires of diverse undergraduate students
                in a sprawling, vibrant public university system? 2) How can online community spaces
                enhance undergraduate digital humanities pedagogy? By exploring these questions, we
                hope to support others in bringing the insights of humanistic inquiry and critical
                pedagogy to bear on the production of digital learning spaces that maximize
                participation, equity, and collaboration within and beyond the undergraduate
                classroom.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Selecting and developing a platform that would help both graduate and undergraduate
                students form a generative learning community was not only an educational technology
                project, but one that required the insights of humanistic knowledge and inquiry. It
                required thinking about power dynamics in the classroom and multiple ways of
                conceiving student-teacher relationships. For these insights, we turned to critical
                pedagogy, and the work of thinkers such as Paulo Freire, Jacques Rancière, and bell
                hooks [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#freire1970">Freire 1970</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#ranciere1991">Rancière 1991</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#hooks2003">hooks 2003</a>]. Critical pedagogy challenges teachers and students to
                reconfigure hierarchies of power and knowledge in classrooms, institutions, and
                society. Thinking alongside Freire, who argues that liberatory pedagogy can only
                emerge by working “<em class="emph">with</em>, not <em class="emph">for</em>”
                     [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#freire1970">Freire 1970</a>, 48] those marginalized by the social order, we took a grassroots approach to
                knowledge production by developing this platform with ample input from the graduate
                student instructors and undergraduate students who were using it. Our work was also
                informed by Rancière’s emphasis on teaching students to learn from one another,
                rather than having to rely on an authority figure. Cognizant of ways that classrooms
                often reproduce power hierarchies, we sought to create an online community that
                would support learning through a more egalitarian, collaborative, creative,
                student–centered, and participatory experience. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">While the online community we built can be understood as one possible answer to
                Posner’s call for critical interrogation and radical reimagination, our digital
                humanities praxis is also inspired by an earlier interlocutor, Audre Lorde, a poet,
                activist, and theorist who was also both a CUNY alumni and professor. In her essay,
                    “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s
                    House,” Lorde argues that feminists need a different relationship to
                difference: one that understands racial, sexual, and gender differences as sources
                of vital creativity, the kind of creativity necessary to imagine and bring about a
                more just and equitable world. In our efforts to build a user-friendly tool that
                would welcome and celebrate differences among undergraduate student users, we also
                used the insights of intersectionality, which, as Roopika Risam has recently argued,
                encourages digital humanities practitioners to “begin their work with an understanding of the
                        particularities necessary to design projects that account for influences of
                        difference on knowledge production”
                     [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#risam2015">Risam 2015</a>]. As such, we sought to build a learning community that would help draw out
                the wide range of experiences and knowledges that diverse undergraduate students
                bring to their classrooms. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">With these considerations in mind, we embarked on our project to create an online
                environment that would unsettle academic structures of power and privilege, in part
                by treating differences — including differences in learning styles — as a valuable
                resource necessary for institutional and social change. We wanted not only to
                critique the structures of power reproduced through proprietary, hierarchical, and
                closed-access educational technologies, but to provide horizontal networked and open
                alternatives developed through structured collaboration between public university
                teachers and students. As we refined our online community, we sought to actualize
                these principles, remaining conscious of the ways in which one-size-fits-all
                assumptions about pedagogy, assignments, composition, and assessment have
                historically discouraged and excluded students who learn in distinct and creative
                ways [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#davidson2011">Davidson 2011</a>]

                    inaugural course of the Futures Initiative, a program established in 2014 by
                    Cathy N. Davidson at the Graduate Center, CUNY, in order to advance equity and
                    innovation in higher education. A federated university system that consists of
                    twenty–four colleges spanning the five boroughs of New York City, CUNY has
                    historically been a hotbed of progressive pedagogy, in part due to its diverse,
                    working–class student population.<a class="noteRef" href="savonick-building.html#d22328e267">[1]</a> The Free Academy (now CUNY’s City College) was initially
                    described as an educational “experiment” that would test “whether the children of the people, the children of the

                        Education” at the Graduate Center. While a graduate seminar may seem
                    like an unlikely site from which to rethink undergraduate teaching in the
                    digital humanities, this radically interdisciplinary course focused explicitly
                    on the unique dual role of graduate students as formal learners and teachers: it
                    brought together graduate students who were teaching undergraduate classes with
                    the explicit aim of empowering their students by moving beyond academic models
                    of apprenticeship, expertise, and hierarchical authority — the same ideals that
                    have structured higher education since the mid-nineteenth century. The course
                    thematized the discrepancy between our current, standardized forms of education,
                    still shaped by the Taylorized Industrial Age (1865-1925), and the new modes of
                    distributed agency, knowledge production, and communication made possible by the
                    Internet. Graduate students and their undergraduates explored “new methods of peer learning and teaching,
                            interdisciplinary research collaborations, experiential learning, new
                            digital tools, and public (online) contributions to knowledge”

                    Lehman College, Queens College, and Kingsborough Community College. While the
                    graduate student teachers came from many disciplines, and were teaching
                    undergraduate courses in topics ranging from chemistry to theater, all used
                    student-centered, peer-driven pedagogy to achieve successful student outcomes.

                    was important to have a website that was accessible, served to facilitate
                    learning and exploration, could be used by instructors across different
                    disciplines, and also connected community members. Using CBOX, with its
                    open-source and CUNY-based roots, was a logical choice for us, as it aligned
                    with our expectations and needs for a dynamic website structure. According to
                    the platform designers, “CBOX will be useful to any organization that is looking

                <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Many of our decisions regarding our CBOX installation involved finding a balance
                    between the benefits of public-facing pedagogy and the need to create a
                    supportive learning environment in which students could experiment with new
                    ideas and take intellectual risks without the fear of public scrutiny. While
                    there are certainly benefits to having undergraduates write and learn in public,
                    doing so can make them susceptible to “trolls” — people
                    prowling the Internet looking to attack, rather than meaningfully engage with,
                    those whose viewpoints differ from their own (see, e.g. [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#berg2015">Berg 2015</a>]). Though we are committed to working transparently in public, we also respect
                    the privacy of the individuals participating in our program. Therefore, we have
                    given courses and groups the option to be private or partially-private on the
                    site, so that students and their instructors can decide how public they would
                    like their learning and teaching to be. Upon creating a site or group, users
                    determine the level of privacy, though they can later change permissions and
                    access levels through their administrative dashboard. To ensure a safe and
                    inclusive online area for users and courses, independent groups and individual
                    sites can be set by each networked site’s administrator — in this case, the
                    doctoral students teaching undergraduate courses — to be completely public, open
                    to the site’s network members but closed to the public, completely private, or
                    public with a locked area. This degree of user autonomy offers users a level of
                    freedom and authority to choose how best to generate and share their content and
                    to what audience(s). </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">These various levels of privacy allow courses to operate without the public
                    watching if users choose, or users can alternately run a very transparent course
                    so that other instructors can make use of resources and methods coming out of
                    student-centered learning practices. Of the sites on the Futures Initiative
                    network, about 40% are visible to the public to some degree, while 60% are
                    visible only to users affiliated with that specific site. Of the groups, 38% are
                    public, 50% are private, and 12% are hidden. As is evidenced by these numbers,
                    the level of privacy selected by users who administer sites and groups greatly
                    varies, with many choosing each option. The control afforded to users — in this
                    case both course instructors and undergraduate students — in determining the
                    degree of access that others have to their content therefore seems to be
                    valuable, as some prefer public spaces for convening while others opt for
                    privacy to conduct courses or write a personal blog outside of the general
                    public’s eye. This balance provides both a haven for discussions to take place
                    and a public platform to those who feel comfortable sharing their

                    ethics scholar Michael Zimmer notes, <blockquote><p>
                        Web 2.0 also embodies a set of unintended consequences,
                            including increased flow of personal information across networks, the
                            diffusion of one’s identity across fractured spaces, the emergence of
                            powerful tools for peer surveillance, the exploitation of free labor for
                            commercial gain, and the fear of increased corporatization of online
                            social and collaborative spaces and outputs.

                    </p></blockquote>To counteract that risk, we advised graduate student instructors in best
                    practices for digital identity management and recommended that they do the same
                    with their students. For example, early in the semester, when creating a digital
                    map of their courses using “selfies,” graduate student
                    instructors encouraged undergraduate students to use representational, rather
                    than personally identifiable selfies (e.g. a book, a cat, an office chair) in
                    order to protect their privacy. In addition, we customized the signup and
                    profile creation process to ensure that users could determine how much of their
                    identity they wished to share with others. Especially in a moment of heightened
                    attention to students’ immigration statuses, and considering that students may
                    choose to use these online spaces to share personal stories and experiences,
                    these privacy precautions are particularly urgent.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="savonick-building.html#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18"> The site sign-up process presented an opportunity for graduate student
                    instructors to talk with their undergraduate students about privacy and online
                    identity. Instructors, in conversation with their students, set up options for
                    signing up for an account using a pseudonym, the true identity of which would
                    only be known by the instructor and (optionally) the students in the class, in
                    order to protect students’ privacy. While new users are asked for a CUNY

                    horizontal community structure, such a decision may merely conceal actual
                    differentials of power and privilege between students and instructors, a tension

                        collaborative space for higher education in public,” Lisa Tagliaferri
                    found via network analysis and visualization that users joined course sites and

                    been noted extensively, the digital divide — or what Jan A.G.M. van Dijk
                    suggests is more aptly named “the digital spectrum” —
                    presents substantial issues for those who do not have access to the Internet

                    historically been vehicles for privileged classes to be informed, and today
                    those who do not have access to the web do not have the same opportunities as
                    those who enjoy Internet service in their homes. In the urban centers of the
                    United States, libraries in particular offer computers connected to the Internet
                    as a resource to the public, but this does not ultimately provide the same level

                        “mobile by default”; CUNY students in particular use
                    their smartphones for academic activities including reading, research and even

                    was the need to design lessons, activities, assignments, and assessment
                    techniques shaped by an understanding of undergraduate students’ diverse modes
                    of learning. We hoped that the blog and forum components of the site would allow
                    instructors to rethink assessment, and particularly how class participation is
                    measured. While some students are either not afforded the opportunity to
                    participate because they are enrolled in large lecture courses or they are
                    intimidated by classroom conversation dynamics, a supplementary online

                    of their courses (see, e.g. [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#may2014">May 2014</a>]). In their 2015 study of
                        “Mapping,” Janey Oliphint Flanagan and Deborah Greenblatt
                    found that the digital tools used in the class, and the CBOX site in particular, “added to the sense of community by giving quieter
                            students a comfortable place to share their thoughts and continue

                    groups that were not required by their instructors. Approximately 90% of the

                    loosely on the concept of mapping, to allow for graduate student instructors and
                    undergraduate students to interpret the project, adapt technologies to their
                    learning goals, and approach technologies that were accessible to their skill
                    and comfort levels. As information technologists Liang Jingjing and Zhan
                    Qinglong note, with user-centered technologies, it is important for users to be
                    able to access and use technologies to meet their goals so that they maintain
                    motivation throughout their learning experience [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#jingjing2010">Jingjing and Qinglong 2010</a>, 301–304]. That is, technologies should be meeting users’ needs rather
                    than users adapting for technology. Therefore, the Futures Initiative Research
                    Fellows provided examples and support for GIS tools and other technologies to
                    graduate student instructors and undergraduate students, while encouraging them
                    to experiment and utilize what they found to be most applicable to their
                    educational goals. Rather than — although more often, in addition to — producing
                    traditional final research papers, graduate and undergraduate students
                    affiliated with the “Mapping” course learned to use platforms
                    like Google Docs, YouTube, Google Maps, Maps Marker, Adobe Illustrator, CartoDB,
                    OpenStreetMap, TikiToki, and WordPress to present what they had learned

                        201” to “Greek and Latin Roots of English.”
                    These various digital tools that students learned to use for their
                        “Mapping” projects illustrate their wide range of digital
                    literacies and diverse modes of creative expression. </div>

                    is preferred. Flanagan and Greenblatt found that these efforts are heading in
                    the right direction: by analyzing student interviews and surveys they determined
                    that the site was primarily used for “communication, collaboration, and learning with

                    instructors who incentivized student participation (through, for example,
                    mandatory blog posts for participation credit) predictably had more user
                    interaction, suggesting that more can be done to structure engagement outside of

                    network, we included a customized automatic join feature in the WordPress
                    hooks.php file (a file for developers to add their own code, no relation to bell
                    hooks) to enroll all new users in a site-wide group that they could later opt
                    out of if desired. Currently, users are connected to the
                        “Welcome!” group, through which we circulate information
                    about workshops and events related to student-centered pedagogy and
                    institutional change, and invite site users to participate in our multi-year
                        “University Worth Fighting For” initiative. Automatically
                    enrolling users into these groups is a way for us to digitally wave
                        “hello” to users and to connect them immediately with the
                    greater network by giving each user a platform within the
                        “Welcome!” group forum to write and respond to others.
                    Flanagan and Greenblatt found that these initial efforts to build community were

                    than other open-source and especially proprietary educational content management
                    systems that are built by developers and technologists rather than teachers and
                    students themselves. CBOX is a project that comes out of the CUNY community of
                    teachers and students that are using it, and also contributes code upstream to
                    the greater open-source WordPress community. Through our team’s ongoing
                    contributions to our customized version of CBOX and to the greater CBOX network,
                    we can reassess the ideals that are channeled into a broader network through a
                    commitment to code developed by the end users it serves. </div>

                    educational needs and desires of CUNY’s diverse student population, we used the
                    insights of humanistic inquiry to inform digital learning spaces at the
                    undergraduate level. The Futures Initiative CBOX tool and its associated mapping
                    project were the beginning of an investigation to find, transform, and develop
                    flexible environments for digital learning alongside innovative classroom
                    practices. As we continue to work together with students to imagine better
                    digital humanities tools, we hope to open this dialogue with other educators
                    interested in building classrooms that incorporate digital humanities

                    is the possibility to offer extended workshops with fellows and administrators
                    in our group, or else to liaise with other digital initiatives at the Graduate
                    Center to offer specialized instruction. This kind of support may help users to
                    be less dependent on one-on-one help later in the semester, which may make
                    workflows for Futures Initiative Fellows and administrators more consistent over

                    to encourage open-access and sharing of materials. However, there is more that
                    can be done to increase transparency, support, and access. Currently, the
                    Futures Initiative site points to the CUNY Academic Commons’ FAQs and
                    documentation, though it would be preferable to have our own site-specific FAQs,
                    and perhaps our own documentation as our site evolves over time. To this end,
                    the site’s current administrators and developers — FI Fellows Jessica Murray and
                    Michelle Morales — have put together a series of tutorials for building sites on
                    CBOX to encourage self-guided troubleshooting. We plan to use animated GIFs as
                    the primary visual method for explicating use cases (similar to GitHub’s
                    Guides), in order to make our FAQs accessible to users who are inexperienced
                    with the WordPress content management system. Additionally, we plan to make our

                    abilities. This will likely include multilingual support (especially in the
                    largely immigrant student community of CUNY), additional keyboard-based
                    controls, text-to-speech support, and a more careful use of alt tags when

                    balance between the site’s customizability and its ease-of-use, the emergence of
                    a new, recent network site testifies to the success of our first year. Over the
                    summer, thirty-five undergraduates from among the 365 students affiliated with
                        “Mapping” courses applied, were selected, and received a
                    stipend to serve as Futures Initiative Mentors. These were students who had used
                    CBOX in their Futures Initiative courses the previous semester and had
                    contributed to the CUNY Maps of New York. At the end of a two-day intensive
                    mentorship training session, the graduate instructors facilitating the workshop
                    reproduced a version of the pedagogical experiment implemented in
                        “Mapping.” After telling the undergraduate peer mentors
                    that they would have two hours to design final projects that would help them
                    mentor other CUNY students in the upcoming academic year, the graduate student
                    mentors and other workshop facilitators left the room, trusting the
                    undergraduate mentors’ abilities to collaborate in the production of effective
                    mentorship resources. Upon returning to the workshop, the facilitators found
                    that the undergraduate mentors had abandoned their preliminary plans of creating
                    several projects, and had instead opted to create a mentorship site on the
                    Futures Initiative CBOX platform, one that would serve as a hub to keep them
                    connected across geographic campus divides, which they would populate with
                    useful information for their peers. Several undergraduate mentors have since
                    taken a lead role in designing this site, creating a private page for mentors to
                    dialogue about the mentoring process, a page for mentees to ask questions, and
                    resource pages for each campus. The fact that undergraduate students from across
                    different campuses and majors, and with varying degrees of digital literacy,
                    felt empowered to design an online space using CBOX testifies to the success of
                    our initial efforts to create a dynamic, accessible online learning
                    community.</div>

                    well due to it being built upon the familiar platforms of BuddyPress and
                    WordPress. We believe that the site and its student-driven mapping project are
                    scalable to fit the needs of other institutions and courses both nationally and
                    internationally, and that connecting learners across disciplinary and

                    created the system of modern American research universities we have inherited
                    today, decisions about education have tended to flow from the wealthy, elite
                    schools attended by relatively few students, downwards and outwards to those who
                    teach working-class students, often with minimal resources [<a class="ref" href="savonick-building.html#davidson2017">Davidson 2017</a>]. Including these very students in the decisions
                    that are made about their education is crucial to their empowerment and sense of
                    agency far beyond the classroom. Drawing on insights from the digital humanities
                    and student-centered pedagogy, the Futures Initiative works to counter
                    institutional and structural inequality not through goodwill, but by building
                    structures for equality. Instead of making decisions “for”
                    undergraduates, we train graduate students across disciplines to work
                        “with” their students in creating their learning and
                    their learning environments, thus engaging the kind of critical, creative, and
                    collaborative participation necessary in the world beyond the classroom. We have
                    found that when undergraduate and graduate students alike are treated as active
                    and dynamic knowledge-producers, each of whom has something to contribute to the
                    scene of teaching and learning, hierarchical relationships of power and
                    knowledge are reconfigured. This, in turn, demands something other than
                    traditional classrooms, practices, modes of assessment, and online learning
                    spaces. Full participation, equitable collaboration, and student-centered
                    learning require and produce different structures and spaces. Through our work
                    on this open-source, community-created, and student-driven online learning
                    platform, we seek to include graduate and undergraduate students in the creation
                    of their learning. By creating environments for equitable participation and
                    successful collaboration among diverse and creative students, we are working to
                    promote social change and redistribute power, starting in the undergraduate
                    classroom. In a climate of educational austerity, we are working to build a
