Collaboration in the Spotlight: 
The Open Symphony Case 
by Kate Hayes

I n September 2014, I began working on a concept of audience interactionfor live music as part of my master’s degree at Guildhall School of Music
and Drama (GSMD). The pathway of this masters was leadership (the other
two being composition and performance). To give some idea of what
leadershipmeans in this context, the pathway was focused less on
developing an instrumental skill or performance technique and more on
developing an artistic craft, with a strong focus on collaboration – either
with other musicians, with communities, with artists of other disciplines or
in different fields. It provided a performance arts environment and a space
to experiment with all aspects of what influenced you as a musician,
something which is common in other art practices, such as visual art and
theatre, but sadly often missing
from formal music training. For the
final exam, students present a
subject, chosen by them, in a format
of their choice. Some examples from
previous presentations include an
oboist collaborating with an
electronic musician and light artist
to explore the Japanese concept of
Wabi-sabi; a flautist exploring the
love songs of fruit flies to create a
music piece and visual presentation;
and a singer exploring her Israeli
identity and how its history impacts on Palestinians today through Holocaust
song and collaboration with Palestinian singers.
Although I am a singer, technology has always had a strong influence on

my work, which uses different sound processing techniques, stereo and

EDITOR’S SUMMARY
The voice of the performing arts is an important – though seldom heard –
disciplinary component of information science research. The Open Symphony, a
collaboration between a performing musician and computer science students,
allowed for creative audience interaction with live music performances. But such
interdisciplinary collaboration is difficult and needs to be put within the larger
context of questions surrounding value, individual contribution in artistic expression
and ownership in the performing arts. Indeed, tensions around the economics of art
and commercial versus academic value may hinder collaborations between artists
and academia, but with the right framework and definitions of value these efforts
could lead to additional forms of cross-disciplinary exploration.

Kate Hayes is a music artist and entrepreneur whose work centers on mutual
engagement and collective expression. As a multi-genre singer, she has a keen
awareness of both the relationship between music and its listeners, and the
singer’s unique position between the more subjective nature of music and the
more concrete content of lyrics. Her work includes Abstract Songs, a collection of
vocal compositions that challenges the audience perception of lyrical meaning;
Compass Rose, using interactive technology to showcase traditional singing of
female immigrants and; Open Symphony, a live music performance using audience
interactive compositions and technology. Her latest project, CoreUs, is developing
music composition styles and digital technology to disrupt the current roles within
music performance, utilizing the audience as an additional creative source.

quadrophonic manipulation, and interactive technology. When I entered the
program, my work was developing beyond integrating technology in music
production towards joining technology and music to imbed people back in
the music-making process. Rather than focusing on person-to-computer to
create music, I was focusing on person-to-person supported by technology
and music to create a true community of collaborators. 

Open Symphony’s Conception
I conceived Open Symphony on two levels: democratizing creativity and

recommissioning our digital selves as engagers rather than distractors. My
desire to share the musical space was undoubtedly influenced by my musical
upbringing in traditional Irish music, where like all folk music, each
participant’s contribution is valued, regardless of musical level. Access to
participation is always possible and encouraged as a learning method. The
performer’s role was to give voice to the community, which serves to
strengthen the relationship between performer and audience. This sense of
community ownership and belonging generated a profound value in these
shared musical experiences for me, something I felt was disappearing in the
music industry I had been working in. The record industry’s narrow
emphasis on product over process and the classical music industry’s
insistence on sacrificing creative interpretation for instrumental excellence
were not fully serving the creation, expression or purpose of music. 
Alongside these issues, live events are plagued by audience members’

phones obscuring the view for others, causing distractions and threatening
copyrights. Consumers are paying to attend events that they are increasingly
experiencing virtually. As the internet revolution of Napster destroyed the
recording industry, I was aware that our digital selves were devaluing the
experience of live music. My concerns were not with the loss of revenue for
the music industry but for the loss of cultural value. The idea came to harness
our phones to connect with the music rather than our digital profiles,
enabling deeper listening, ownership and sense of community. The creative
interaction of Open Symphony not only allows audiences to invest in music
pieces, but exposes the creative process of the performers, thus creating a
second level of valuation on music. It moves music away from a content

industry to one of socially created value, in line with the great value shift
created by the community-curated nature of the internet. Open Symphony
offers music as a live community event, rescued from celebrity profiles or
virtuosic gods. 

The Technology Development
Open Symphony has three dimensions of research – music composition,

music performance and interactive technology. As I continued the research of
the musical parameters of the system at GSMD, I established a collaboration
with the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen
Mary University of London (QM) to co-design the technology architecture.
Two master’s students, Yongmeng Wu and Leshao Zhang under the
supervision of Mathieu Barthet, began designing this system, based on my
brief. Over two months, we met regularly to co-design the visuals to suit both
the musicians’ and the audiences’ needs, settling on a linear graphic score for
the musicians and a touch-
button app with voting
displayed. Using my music
ensemble, we tested the
system from a performer’s
perspective, gathering
feedback and letting this
input inform the tech
development. Unfortunately,
the technology missed my
own master’s deadline for
which I presented a
multimedia piece on the
perception of the singer and the relationship between song and audience.
The first presentation of Open Symphony was for the Viva of the QM
students. For this occasion, we presented the system with my ensemble plus
an audience. Based on this performance, we wrote the paper which led us to
presenting Open Symphony at the 2016 Conference on Human Factors in
Computing Systems (CHI2016) in San Jose, California.

Collaboration
Research as artistic practice is not a new concept for the creative artist.

Picasso wonderfully describes this process: “Paintings are but research and
experimentation. I never do paintings as a work of art. All of them are
researches. I search constantly and there is a logical sequence in all this
research” [1, p. 33]. This narrative can quite directly transpose to academic
research, with its own twist and turns, new directions and unfolding
discoveries. But despite this similarity, the border between academic research
and artistic creativity remains uneasy and at times contentious.
From my Open Symphony experience of cross-collaboration, I suggest that

this friction is caused by unresolved forces on two levels: individual competence
for interdisciplinary collaborations and environmental differences.

Competence in Collaboration
Collaborations benefit from shared resources and knowledge but

collaborative behaviors are often an overlooked key component. Just as one
would expect teachers to have knowledge of their subjects as well as the skills
to deliver the material, collaborations need to be conducted with subject
knowledge plus collaborative skills. While every sector requires staff to work
with a range of people, both inside and outside an organization, collaboration
across fields relies far more on that skill set. To enable interdisciplinary
work, there needs to be a leader with the skills to draw together a disparate
team around a common goal, developing new practices for combined
methodologies, terminology, manner of discourse and personal conduct.
According to the 2010 NESTA report Creating Value Across Boundaries [2,
p. 21], “the skills most relevant to successful interdisciplinary innovation
appear to arise from personal attributes and good leadership.” The ability to
create cohesion among the team, display congeniality, recognize, accept and
celebrate successes that do not arise directly from their own work or vision
were cited as feminization while an alpha-male style of leadership was
described as counterproductive to these collaborations. A wider combination
of personality types is needed for an interdisciplinary team to be successful,
with an updated understanding of what good leadership qualities are [2, p. 21].
If collaboration skills such as communication and flexibility are a

challenge in a collaborative enterprise, how can we minimize this risk? This
question brings me to the wider environmental issues related to the varying
pursuits of the academic institute and the artistic domain. 

The Bigger Picture: The Music Environment
The Purposes for Creating Music. Let me clarify four distinct and
important aspects within the music realm. These are not the structural nature
of music such as pitch, tempo or dynamics, nor the performance elements of
emotional communication, stage presence, gesture and so forth. They are
not the listener’s reaction to the performance nor the setting of it. These four
are the dynamics, the magnets, which interplay overtly and subtly throughout
music’s practice and purpose. They answer the question of why we engage in
music. These are the four aspects:  
� education
� entertainment
� economy
� artistry
Regardless of one’s music playing ability, we all engage in music on some

level for different purposes. There’s an interaction between each, but I think it’s
helpful to distinguish them to understand their influences on each other and
to distinguish the artistic nature of music, the least tangible of the four. While
we have some clear understanding of music as an entertainment or education
and of its economy, artistic practice within music remains a misunderstood
domain for both non-musicians and at many times, musicians themselves. Once
one identifies which of these functions of music a collaboration is exploiting
or researching, the value of the artistic contribution may become clearer. 
However, setting aside the more immeasurable questions around art, such as

its meaning, function and importance, let’s look at the economics surrounding
art. What is the good, the product, the service that is being produced, and
what framework supports this product? These questions are easier to answer
for research institutions, but are murky waters for creative expression.

Economic Realities of Music and Their Possible Impact on
Academic Collaboration. First, how is value measured in something as
subjective as music? A look at one of music’s own ecosystem reveals an

uncomfortable truth. Let’s look at orchestras as one financial model. The
United Kingdom has world-leading orchestras, with an earned income of
£56m in 2016 [3]. However, this figure represents less than 50% of total
orchestra income, the rest coming from public investment and contributed
income. In the same year, the orchestras employed 2,411 musicians in regular
or full-time positions. Orchestras represent the pinnacle of instrumental
skill, selecting the best candidates from leading conservatories. But the
student intake for the UK’s eight conservatories between 2013 and 2015 was
2,900. In this market, there is a clear over supply, compounded by the fact
that the industry isn’t financially self-sufficient. On top of these problems,
the classical industry is in steady decline as audiences seek immersive,
unpredictable and more personalized music experiences. The takeaway here
is this: top instrumental skill does not equate to top earnings. Of course,
orchestras add more than financial value to an economy, but the dichotomy
between the pursuit of excellence and the lack of public demand is a recurring
theme across the orchestral music sector. Question: How can the music
sector be explicit in its value in a cross-sector collaboration when it lacks
transparency within its own sector?
Second, how is individual contribution valued in music? In the 18th and

early 19th centuries, musicians had the freedom to express themselves in the
works of composers, with composers like Mozart leaving room in the music
for individual improvisation. Musicians gained fame through their
individual flair demonstrated in these improvisations. In the late 19th
century, the focus shifted away from the individual musician’s improvisation
and more to the musician’s interpretation of the composer’s work. Music
institutions became the guardians of these works focusing on instrumental
skill above all else. A similar narrowing of focus has occurred in the record
industry. In the 1970s, bands dominated the music industry, with acts such
as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac ushering
in an era of stadium rock. While in 2016, according to the Forbes ranking
(www.forbes.com/celebrities/list/), the highest paid music acts were more
noticeably solo artists, with the exception of one boyband.
1. Taylor Swift $170m
2. One Direction $110m

3. Adele $80.5m
4. Madonna $76.5m
5. Rihanna $75m 
These massive incomes from music are not being distributed across the

music sector where a staggering 78% of musicians in the UK earn less than
£30k ($36.6k) per year [4]. Question: When income doesn’t reflect the
talent and experience of a musician, how will this reality impact
collaborations between the music industry and the research industry?
The third and final issue lies around ownership. Intellectual property

rights (IPR) are the economic framework that underpins music, with
copyright its currency. Historically, a musician’s creative expression was
encapsulated in the following:
� live performances, protecting performers’ rights through attendance fees;
� print, score, writings and so forth, protecting composers’ rights through 
sales; 

� recordings, vinyl, CDs and so forth, protecting recording musicians’ rights
through licensing. 
Ownership of copyright has been a brutally fought battle within the

industry since the rise of recording technology, with recording industries
exploiting musicians and musicians exploiting fellow musicians. However,
since the growth of the internet, copyright is rapidly becoming uncontrollable.
Each previously protected realm is shattered by the ease with which recordings
are reproduced online, live shows recorded by individuals’ smartphones and
lyrics and scores are shared across a digital community. Question: As music’s
own framework dismantles, what assumptions of ownership need
addressing for cross-collaborations to correctly accredit contribution?

The Possibilities
With the rapidly changing landscape of the music industry and from my

experience of the Open Symphony collaboration I certainly believe that there
is great potential in exploring the territory between academic research and
artistic output. There are obvious clashes such as opinion bias and the length
of time it takes to establish arts impact, but there are signs that pursuing
these collaborations would benefit both communities.

During the height of the record industry, record companies acted in a
similar way to research academies providing financial support for recording
albums, studio time to develop the work and being the spokesperson for the
artist. In return, the artist assigned creative rights to the record label. With
the demise of the record industry, this structure has been lost within the
music sector. This bodes well for art and research collaborations, which
could re-establish this framework in another context. 
In the 20th century, the arrival of the record industry transformed popular

music culture in to a commercial entity. As money has interacted with music,
it has transformed the relationships within it. Within certain genres, the concept
of copyright disrupts the tradition of the music itself. Quotation within jazz,
for example, and recycled lyrics in blues and folk display the musicians’
expertise of that genre rather than plagiarism. Copyright has and continues to
serve as a significant part of music’s economic framework, but it is far from a
one-size-fits-all. Organizing intellectual property rights in affiliation with an
organization such as a university, rather than a purely commercial entity such
as the record industry, could protect genuine artistic research and development. 
Musicians are an underused yet highly skilled resource of creativity,

flexibility and curiosity. Musicians’ intense dedication to their craft and
portfolio careers provides the expertise and adaptability to explore new
creative contexts. The strongest common ground for practicing artists and
researchers is their curiosity. As John Cage said, “I can’t understand why
people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of old ones” [5, p. 211].
With the right language and framework in place, true collaborations between
arts practices and research academia would prove fertile and exciting ground.
Music is in dire need of transformation. The record industry has been in

denial of the internet revolution and music conservatories have been slow to
adapt to the changing environment of artistic pursuit. However, we are
seeing a shift within music schools to encourage creativity alongside
instrumental skills. In 2015, GSMD introduced an undergraduate course in
performance and creative enterprise. Open to musicians, composers, theatre
makers, devisors, spoken word artists, beatboxers and poets, it is intended
for those who want to develop their performance, production, collaboration
and leadership skills for employment in the arts industry. 

Conclusion
Open Symphony transforms traditional composition and performance. It

challenges the concept of ownership and the role of the musician to the
audience. My aim for the collaboration was to utilize the rigor of academic
research and a diverse skill set with the creative drive and underutilized skills
of musicians. It encountered the issues outlined above but has had levels of
success. From an academic research point of view, I presented at CHI2016
and published papers. From an artistic point of view, I had proof of concept. 
For future success, academies of art and research institutions need to

develop their understanding of each other’s realm and where, how and why
their borders intersect. A structure needs to be developed with advocates
and stakeholders that guide collaborators across new terrains.
I believe a lot of change needs to come from the music sector in defining

value, diversifying skill sets and embracing change. It would also benefit
from removing the many untrue and unhelpful stereotypes of musicians. 
Not all a musician’s contributions can be captured on a score, a recording

or in a live performance. In training or professional experience musicians
will sometimes reference music that influences them but rarely supply a
thorough and in-depth analysis of their music or performance. Musicians
need to develop their craft beyond performance and composition to develop
robust research skills and understand their value contribution.
Music artists are radical non-conformists. Our practice is a process of

discovery and disruption. But given the instability and misrepresentation
within our own industry, the risks involved in artistic-academic
collaborations will remain far greater to the musician and the art than to the
academic institute and the research findings. Both sectors can resonate on the
other’s passion and purpose but the territory of interdisciplinary exploration
is dependent on far greater societal and commercial restructuring.
