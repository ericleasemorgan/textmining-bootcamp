        Doing Research in the Digital Age

        Doing Research in the Digital Age is the introductory strand of the Digital Methods programme offered by Cambridge Digital Humanities. Our varied programme of events is aimed at making a broad community of researchers - from graduate students to senior academics - familiar with the key concepts, methods and tools required to do research in the digital age.

        Advanced Workshops

        Cambridge Digital Humanities offers a year-long programme of advanced digital methods workshops, which are often run in collaboration with research projects or external partners. Our advanced workshops are aimed at a wide range of researchers, from PhD students to academics who are leaders in their field. Many of the workshops are open for registration or application from participants outside the University of Cambridge.

        Showcased Project

        Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic is an interdisciplinary research project led by social anthropologist, Dr Christos Lynteris. As Yersinia pestis spread from country to country and from continent to continent, it left behind it not only a trail of death and terror, but also a growing visual archive on the first global pandemic to be captured by the photographic lens.

        About
        
      

    

    
    We are a network of researchers at the University of Cambridge who are interested in how the use of digital tools is transforming scholarship in the humanities and social sciences. This transformation spans both the content and practice of humanities research, as the diffusion of digital technologies opens up new fields of study and generates research questions which breach traditional disciplinary boundaries.
