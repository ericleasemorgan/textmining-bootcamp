<ner>Internet Wiretap Edition of A GHOST STORY by MARK TWAIN From Sketches New and Old Copyright 1903 <PERSON>Samuel Clemens</PERSON> This text is placed in the Public Domain May 1993 A Ghost Story I TOOK a large room far up <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> in a huge old building whose upper stories had been wholly unoccupied for years until I came The place had long been given up to dust and cobwebs to solitude and silence I seemed groping among the tombs and invading the privacy of the dead that first night I climbed up to my quarters For the first time in my life a superstitious dread came over me and as I turned a dark angle of the stairway and an invisible cobweb swung its slazy woof in my face and clung there I shuddered as one who had encountered a phantom I was glad enough when I reached my room and locked out the mould and the darkness A cheery fire was burning in the grate and I sat down before it with a comforting sense of relief For two hours I sat there thinking of bygone times recalling old scenes and summoning half forgotten faces out of the mists of the past listening in fancy to voices that long ago grew silent for all time and to once familiar songs that nobody sings now And as my reverie softened down to a sadder and sadder pathos the shrieking of the winds outside softened to a wail the angry beating of the rain against the panes diminished to a tranquil patter and one by one the noises in the street subsided until the hurrying foot steps of the last belated straggler died away in the distance and left no sound behind The fire had burned low A sense of loneliness crept over me I arose and undressed moving on tiptoe about the room doing stealthily what I had to do as if I were environed by sleeping enemies whose slumbers it would be fatal to break I covered up in bed and lay listening to the rain and wind and the faint creaking of distant shutters till they lulled me to sleep I slept profoundly but how long I do not know All at once I found myself awake and filled with a shuddering expectancy All was still All but my own heart I could hear it beat Presently the bed clothes began to slip away slowly toward the foot of the bed as if some one were pulling them I could not stir I could not speak Still the blankets slipped deliberately away till my breast was un covered Then with a great effort I seized them and drew them over my head I waited listened waited Once more that steady pull began and once more I lay torpid a century of dragging seconds till my breast was naked again At last I roused my ener gies and snatched the covers back to their place and held them with a strong grip I waited By and by I felt a faint tug and took a fresh grip The tug strengthened to a steady strain it grew stronger and stronger My hold parted and for the third time the blankets slid away I groaned An answering groan came from the foot of the bed Beaded drops of sweat stood upon my forehead I was more dead than alive Presently I heard a heavy footstep in my room the step of an ele phant it seemed to me it was not like anything human But it was moving FROM me there was relief in that I heard it approach the door pass out without moving bolt or lock and wander away among the dismal corridors straining the floors and joists till they creaked again as it passed and then silence reigned once more When my excitement had calmed I said to my self This is a dream simply a hideous dream And so I lay thinking it over until I convinced myself that it WAS a dream and then a comforting laugh relaxed my lips and I was happy again I got up and struck a light and when I found that the locks and bolts were just as I had left them another soothing laugh welled in my heart and rip pled from my lips I took my pipe and lit it and was just sitting down before the fire when down went the pipe out of my nerveless fingers the blood forsook my cheeks and my placid breathing was cut short with a gasp In the ashes on the hearth side by side with my own bare footprint was another so vast that in comparison mine was but an infant s Then I had HAD a visitor and the elephant tread was explained I put out the light and returned to bed palsied with fear I lay a long time peering into the dark ness and listening Then I heard a grating noise overhead like the dragging of a heavy body across the floor then the throwing down of the body and the shaking of my windows in response to the con cussion In distant parts of the building I heard the muffled slamming of doors I heard at inter vals stealthy footsteps creeping in and out among the corridors and up and down the stairs Some times these noises approached my door hesitated and went away again I heard the clanking of chains faintly in remote passages and listened while the clanking grew nearer while it wearily climbed the stairways marking each move by the loose surplus of chain that fell with an accented rattle upon each succeeding step as the goblin that bore it ad vanced I heard muttered sentences half uttered screams that seemed smothered violently and the swish of invisible garments the rush of invisible wings Then I became conscious that my chamber was invaded that I was not alone I heard sighs and breathings about my bed and mysterious whis perings Three little spheres of soft phosphorescent light appeared on the ceiling directly over my head clung and glowed there a moment and then dropped two of them upon my face and one upon the pillow They spattered liquidly and felt warm Intuition told me they had turned to gouts of blood as they fell I needed no light to satisfy myself of that Then I saw pallid faces dimly luminous and white uplifted hands floating bodiless in the air floating a moment and then disappearing The whispering ceased and the voices and the sounds and a solemn stillness followed I waited and listened I felt that I must have light or die I was weak with fear I slowly raised myself toward a sitting posture and my face came in contact with a clammy hand All strength went from me ap parently and I fell back like a stricken invalid Then I heard the rustle of a garment it seemed to pass to the door and go out When everything was still once more I crept out of bed sick and feeble and lit the gas with a hand that trembled as if it were aged with a hundred years The light brought some little cheer to my spirits I sat down and fell into a dreamy contem plation of that great footprint in the ashes By and by its outlines began to waver and grow dim I glanced up and the broad gas flame was slowly wilt ing away In the same moment I heard that ele phantine tread again I noted its approach nearer and nearer along the musty halls and dimmer and dimmer the light waned The tread reached my very door and paused the light had dwindled to a sickly blue and all things about me lay in a spectral twilight The door did not open and yet I felt a faint gust of air fan my cheek and presently was conscious of a huge cloudy presence before me I watched it with fascinated eyes A pale glow stole over the Thing gradually its cloudy folds took shape an arm appeared then legs then a body and last a great sad face looked out of the vapor Stripped of its filmy housings naked muscular and comely the majestic <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Giant</ORGANIZATION> loomed above me All my misery vanished for a child might know that no harm could come with that benignant countenance My cheerful spirits returned at once and in sympathy with them the gas flamed up brightly again Never a lonely outcast was so glad to welcome company as I was to greet the friendly giant I said Why is it nobody but you Do you know I have been scared to death for the last two or three hours I am most honestly glad to see you I wish I had a chair Here here don t try to sit down in that thing But it was too late He was in it before I could stop him and down he went I never saw a chair shivered so in my life Stop stop You ll ruin ev Too late again There was another crash and another chair was resolved into its original elements Confound it haven t you got any judgment at all Do you want to ruin all the furniture on the place Here here you petrified fool But it was no use Before I could arrest him he had sat down on the bed and it was a melancholy ruin Now what sort of a way is that to do First you come lumbering about the place bringing a legion of vagabond goblins along with you to worry me to death and then when I overlook an indelicacy of costume which would not be tolerated anywhere by cultivated people except in a respectable theater and not even there if the nudity were of YOUR sex you repay me by wrecking all the furniture you can find to sit down on And why will you You damage yourself as much as you do me You have broken off the end of your spinal column and lit tered up the floor with chips of your hams till the place looks like a marble yard You ought to be ashamed of yourself you are big enough to know better Well I will not break any more furniture But what am I to do I have not had a chance to sit down for a century And the tears came into his eyes Poor devil I said I should not have been so harsh with you And you are an orphan too no doubt But sit down on the floor here nothing else can stand your weight and besides we cannot be sociable with you away up there above me I want you down where I can perch on this high counting house stool and gossip with you face to face So he sat down on the floor and lit a pipe which I gave him threw one of my red blankets over his shoulders inverted my sitz bath on his head helmet fashion and made himself picturesque and comfort able Then he crossed his ankles while I renewed the fire and exposed the flat honey combed bot toms of his prodigious feet to the grateful warmth What is the matter with the bottom of your feet and the back of your legs that they are gouged up so Infernal chillblains I caught them clear up to the back of my head roosting out there under <PERSON>Newell</PERSON> s farm But I love the place I love it as one loves his old home There is no peace for me like the peace I feel when I am there We talked along for half an hour and then I noticed that he looked tired and spoke of it Tired he said Well I should think so And now I will tell you all about it since you have treated me so well I am the spirit of the Petrified Man that lies across the street there in the Museum I am the ghost of the <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Giant</ORGANIZATION> I can have no rest no peace till they have given that poor body burial again Now what was the most natural thing for me to do to make men satisfy this wish Terrify them into it haunt the place where the body lay So I haunted the museum night after night I even got other spirits to help me But it did no good for nobody ever came to the museum at midnight Then it occurred to me to come over the way and haunt this place a little I felt that if I ever got a hearing I must succeed for I had the most efficient company that perdition could furnish Night after night we have shivered around through these mildewed halls dragging chains groaning whispering tramping up and down stairs till to tell you the truth I am almost worn out But when I saw a light in your room to night I roused my energies again and went at it with a deal of the old freshness But I am tired out entirely fagged out Give me I beseech you give me some hope I lit off my perch in a burst of excitement and exclaimed This transcends everything everything that ever did occur Why you poor blundering old fossil you have had all your trouble for nothing you have been haunting a PLASTER CAST of your self the real <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Giant</ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION>Albany Footnote</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Twain</PERSON> A fact The original fraud was ingeniously and fraudfully duplicated and exhibited in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> as the only genuine <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Giant</ORGANIZATION> to the unspeakable disgust of the owners of the real colossus at the very same time that the latter was drawing crowds at a museum in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> Confound it don t you know your own remains I never saw such an eloquent look of shame of pitiable humiliation overspread a countenance before The Petrified Man rose slowly to his feet and said Honestly IS that true As true as I am sitting here He took the pipe from his mouth and laid it on the mantel then stood irresolute a moment uncon sciously from old habit thrusting his hands where his pantaloons pockets should have been and medi tatively dropping his chin on his breast and finally said Well I NEVER felt so absurd before The Petrified Man has sold everybody else and now the mean fraud has ended by selling its own ghost My son if there is any charity left in your heart for a poor friendless phantom like me don t let this get out Think how YOU would feel if you had made such an ass of yourself I heard his stately tramp die away step by step down the stairs and out into the deserted street and felt sorry that he was gone poor fellow and sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket and my bath tub END</ner>
