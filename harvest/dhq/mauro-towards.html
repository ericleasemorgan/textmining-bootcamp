                <p>Collaboration is an ethically charged relationship that challenges traditional
                    modes of authorship attribution, institutional norms, and expectations of
                    teaching and learning. A careful reflection on the needs and expectations of
                    project participants demands an exposure of the seams and social dynamics
                    inherent in research-driven relationships. In this paper, we ask: How does
                    integrating digital scholarship into undergraduate pedagogy challenge systems of
                    evaluation and credit and affect collaboration in research environments tuned to
                    promotion and tenure? Emerging from our participation in the Scholarly
                    Communication Institute (2015) in the Research Triangle of North Carolina, this
                    article presents the findings of a team tasked with evaluating best practices
                    and better understanding how authorship and contributorship models emerge in
                    heterogeneous teams of students, faculty, staff, #alt-ac roles, librarians,
                    programmers, and community partners.<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e293">[1]</a></p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital scholarship is often a deeply collaborative and networked enterprise, one
                which involves multiple practitioners from a variety of academic, #altac, and
                non-academic contexts. This kind of socially oriented knowledge creation emerges
                from a community of practice that moves fluidly between curricular experiences and
                co-curricular research experiences, often hosted in DH labs, libraries, and
                    centers.<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e316">[1]</a> Neither formalised evaluative structures nor
                socio-cultural understandings of value and credit have kept pace with disciplinary
                and technological change in the humanities. In this context, scholarly work involves
                a mesh of potentially uneven relationships between many knowledge stakeholders and
                researchers with a range of technical capabilities. For example, student labor is
                paired awkwardly with faculty promotion and tenure, which is driven by faculty
                members’ ability to manage and mobilize large heterogeneous teams of researchers at
                all levels within the academic community. Credit, promotion, funding, and
                credentialing are more complex topics than ever, yet many individuals and
                institutions rely on often outdated structures to assess the value and insights made
                by these networked teams.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Collaborative digital humanities projects present ethically charged relationships
                among non-tenure line and tenure line faculty, graduate and undergraduate students,
                staff, and community stakeholders. Spencer D. C. Keralis’s blog post “Milking the Deficit Internship” describes the power dynamic
                in this way: “Student labor in the classroom is never not coerced”
                     [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#keralis2016">Keralis 2016</a>]. A range of knowledge stakeholders are now able to rethink the hierarchies
                imposed by academic rank and hollow notions of prestige by forming systems that
                emerge from new tools and methods. We believe this moment will allow humanities
                scholars to shape a collaborative practice by balancing pedagogy and labor through
                increased data collection within teams. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">We have determined that collaboration should be locally-determined,
                    <em class="emph">seamfully</em> designed, and mutually productive, regardless of standing
                within or without academic institutions; there must be an intentional ethics that is
                both transparent and adaptive to the needs of the team. We wish to expose the seams
                that knit technological infrastructure and academic assessment for both faculty and
                students working on DH projects. In doing so, we borrow language from Matt Ratto’s
                article “Ethics of Seamless Infrastructures” to think
                critically about our use of technology in humanities scholarship and our
                institutionalization of mentorship and credit allocation [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#ratto2007">Ratto 2007</a>].
                In an effort to best describe these relationships, we present a project-based
                pedagogy that realigns academic hierarchies of prestige and oversight and reflects
                the realities of scholarly labor: we suggest that, in the formation of collaborative
                teams, digital humanists must recognize and explicitly foreground the constraints,
                priorities, and shapes of our professional and institutional positions in order to
                affect a purposeful pedagogy aligned with research. We will present several case
                studies that cross between undergraduate and graduate pedagogies, public engagement,
                business partnerships, scholarly community formation, and #alt-ac roles toward a
                heterogeneous field of contributorship. We present, in other words, a species of
                networked knowledge in practice. Our objective is to link discussions of what we
                have come to call “social knowledge creation” with undergraduate
                education to produce new ways of measuring, evaluating, and validating digital
                    scholarship.<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e357">[2]</a></div>

                    needed; the tools and methods are before us. Socially oriented projects and
                    platforms within DH are evidence of this shift: Day of DH, Digital Humanities

                    Beyond Marc Prensky’s much popularized but widely discredited description of
                    students as “digital natives,” faculty must be ready to link
                    interpretative priorities with employability and an enduring value of education
                    through transferable, durable, and authentic skills [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#prensky2001">Prensky 2001</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e383">[3]</a> The canon and critical thinking
                    skills once served this language of extensibility in education. Students must be
                    ready to work alongside faculty and staff; in so doing, they undoubtedly benefit
                    from discipline-specific expertise and embrace methods and skills that may not
                    be validated by the very institution that grants their degrees. Therefore, the
                    connection between technology and content must not be missed. There must be an
                    integral and functional connection between the technology, teaching, and team
                    integration. In “Digital Pedagogy Unplugged”, Paul
                    Fyfe recounts his surprise upon learning that “Jerome McGann does not especially like
                            computers”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#fyfe2011">Fyfe 2011</a>, 1]. The affordances of a multimedia hypertext were simply required to build
                    the Rossetti Archive; the ability to set text and image in a discoverable
                    interface was made possible by the internet. There is an emerging tension
                    between research-specific computing needs and, as Fyfe puts it, “opening those
                        projects to questions he had yet to imagine” through computing [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#fyfe2011">Fyfe 2011</a>, 1]. The symbiotic relationship between
                    intellectual curiosity and skills-based training in the humanities requires a
                    community of concerns bound by an evolving culture of exploration and
                    experimentation through method. This is a dialogue that should occur between
                    faculty, staff, and students in an ongoing basis during the development and
                    dissemination of in-process scholarly work. In a curricular context, this
                    interdependent relationship between student and instructor means that curricular
                    models aimed at including DH methods may not keep perfect pace with the
                    development of consumer products, technical standards, or open source projects.
                    Providing access to long lasting technical standards and active communities
                    supporting open source technologies that will remain after graduation must be
                    the goal of our training.<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e422">[4]</a>

                    models must be locally determined and agreed upon by local partners, often in an
                    ad hoc way. Bethany Nowviskie has described the “human
                        factors” of our “scholarly machine” and how,
                    even as we conceive of research in the humanities as operating at a great scale,
                    the collaborations themselves unfold on a closer, human scale: “Despite all the focus on cyberinfrastructure and
                            scholarly workflows, we’re fashioning ever closer, more intimate and
                            personalized systems of production”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#nowviskie2012">Nowviskie 2012</a>]. The argument for a greater appreciation of the human scale of research
                    and teaching is the basis for an ethics of collaboration and validating digital
                    scholarship. In this context, Nowviskie’s reminder of human scale of research
                    and teaching also highlights a fundamental inconsistency within university
                    structures, for both faculty and students, that are often more interested in
                    statistical metrics of success. </div>

                        Landscape of Scholarly Communication”, a report by The Center for
                    Studies in Higher Education, the authors seek to describe the pressures facing
                    faculty in collaborative digitally oriented teams and “to understand the needs and practices of faculty for
                            in-progress scholarly communication”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#harley2010">Harley et al. 2010</a>, 2]. Due to the increased time and collaboration required to create large
                    scale digital projects and the likelihood that these efforts may grow without
                    being “finished,” scholarly communication that occurs
                    in-progress is indeed becoming more prominent and bucks the traditional view
                    that knowledge is created when a monograph is printed and bound.<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e473">[5]</a> The report surveys a handful of
                    disciplines–archaeology, astrophysics, biology, economics, history, music, and
                    political science–with a view to understanding the role of technology in
                    collaborative research and in-progress scholarly communication. The core concern
                    for the historians interviewed concerned the “crisis in monographic
                        publication,” which stems from both “cutting back the number of
                        books” published by high quality presses and the “glut of books”
                    produced by low market publishers in an attempt to satiate the “number of books required for advancement at competitive
                            universities”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#harley2010">Harley et al. 2010</a>, 436]. In all of this, the report recognizes that university libraries, facing
                    squeezed budgets, are incapable of purchasing these monographs, which further
                    deflates demand. In <cite class="title italic">Open Access</cite>, Peter Suber has
                    even claimed that the rapid inflation of science based journal subscriptions has
                    caused a knock-on effect in humanities based monograph publishing because
                    university libraries are forced to maintain access to online subscriptions while
                    eroding the physical collection of books housed on campus [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#suber2012">Suber 2012</a>, 32]. The answer offered by the authors of the
                    report is in the successful collaborations revolving around “online databases of archival materials or data sets
                            built collaboratively by scholars”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#harley2010">Harley et al. 2010</a>, 471]. The crisis in scholarly publishing has been well documented in other
                        venues,<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e528">[6]</a> but the response to these pressures has
                    generated, by necessity, informal collaborations that have placed pressure on

                    very pragmatic, perhaps pessimistic, view of what David Berry called the
                        “computational turn” across disciplines, wherein “technologies [have shifted] the critical ground of
                            their concepts and theories”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#berry2011">Berry 2011</a>, 11]. Berry acknowledges that “... with card indexes dying a slow and
                        certain death… there remain few outputs for the non-digital scholar to
                        undertake research in the modern university,” but he extends the
                    consequences of this reality to the need to reimagine pedagogy and the social
                    function of a humanities education. No longer are the humanities tasked with
                    training students for civil participation through a national canon: students, he
                    suggests, “would need to be rethought”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#berry2011">Berry 2011</a>, 6]. Berry imagines a radical, deeply collaborative recentering that “...
                        would change our understanding of knowledge, wisdom and intelligence
                        itself,” a shift to “... a method of thinking with eyes and screen”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#berry2011">Berry 2011</a>, 10].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">In keeping with Berry’s vision of a “collective intellect”
                    spurred by “... a society or association of actors who can think critically
                        together, mediated through technology,” the academy must rethink both
                    undergraduate and graduate students through the lens of a technologically
                    literate, socially participatory community. By validating digital scholarship
                    throughout the university, all research participants by better conceptualize how
                    pedagogy, labor, and contributorship overlap. Likewise, students must reimagine
                    their relationships and expectations for training, professionalization, and
                    future employment. The social aspect of DH becomes the basis for a community of
                    practice that respects the realities of international, networked, and hybrid
                    identities and cultures. Akin to the communities of practitioners that gather
                    online to support open source projects, DH has the potential to become a
                    community of lifelong learning for our students as participation in the
                    workforce will require near perpetual retraining. We are proposing a third space
                    within the university that is both beyond and between the experiences of
                    teaching and research. Understanding the cultural and social realities of online
                    community formation is a relatively new social function of the humanities, and
                    our collaborative work must similarly engage with these realities that face our
                    students, their employers, and the university itself.</div>

                    Non-curricular experiences must thereby promote experimentation and open ended
                    play with technology. Skills acquisition should be part of a student’s outlook
                    toward any technical or cultural problem. Humanities students who embrace this
                    sensibility will, however, face an additional set of problems. The heterogeneous
                    nature of collaborative groups in the humanities means that competing values,
                    concerns, and responsibilities can result in tensions and misunderstandings
                    between Primary Investigators and funders, collaborating faculty and staff,
                    graduate and undergraduate students, and knowledge stakeholders and community
                    partners. Sheila Cavanagh observes in her recent article, “Living in a Digital World: Rethinking Peer Review, Collaboration, and Open
                        Access”, that “collaborative work has a different history in the
                            humanities than in the sciences and conventional reward structures in
                            humanistic disciplines do not always easily accommodate mutual

                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#earhart2015">Earhart 2015</a>, 393]. Social knowledge creation may include geographically disparate

                    standardize student collaborator rights has helped to clarify the ethical
                    imperative for faculty who may be forced by the pressures of tenure and
                    promotion to emphasize scholarly output at the expense of sound pedagogy. Their
                        “Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights” maintains
                    that “[c]ollaborations between students and more experienced

                    non-digital counterpart but stops short of recommending specific frameworks of
                    evaluation and peer review. Compounding the difficulties inherent in formally
                    evaluating digital research is the collaborative involvement of teaching

                    encompasses disciplinary norms and shared authorship practices. Through the lens
                    of media and collaboration, we work to discuss and share guidelines that address

                    pedagogies. We position bell hooks’ Teaching to Transgress as a model for
                    classroom based community formation that negotiates class, race, and gender in
                    an inclusive and productive way [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#hooks1994">hooks 1994</a>]. Our goal is to
                    extend this kind of “liberated classroom,” as hooks describes
                    it, into the research space and into the public space. Social relationships
                    forged beyond the classroom have guided pedagogies that carry the structural
                    oppressions from society into the classroom and, in our current concerns,
                    collaborative teams. As Brett Hirsch puts it in the introduction to <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Pedagogy</cite>,
                        “bracketing” teaching away from research is particularly
                    dangerous [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#hirsch2012">Hirsch 2012</a>, 5]. Whether we are thinking about
                    tenure and promotion, course design, research activities, or the critical
                    discussion of pedagogy or experimental design, we risk marginalizing digital
                    humanities by not fully integrating our research practice within our teaching.
                    Perhaps more subtly, we risk transferring the hierarchy between student and
                    instructor by artificially partitioning teaching from research. Paulo Freire
                    remains instructive on this point: <blockquote><p>
                        The pedagogy of the oppressed, as a humanist and
                            libertarian pedagogy, has two distinct stages. In the first, the
                            oppressed unveil the world of oppression and through the praxis commit
                            themselves to its transformation. In the second stage, in which the
                            reality of oppression has already been transformed, this pedagogy ceases
                            to belong to the oppressed and becomes a pedagogy of all people in the
                            process of permanent liberation.
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#freire2005">Freire 2005</a>, 55]
                    </p></blockquote> We argue that theoretically informed interventions remain the source of
                    digital humanities work, but digital humanities must structure collaborative
                    work to reflect that ethics in a broader pedagogy. The slippage and breadth of
                    collective pronouns is a symptom of this broader problem of credit allocation.
                    As faculty, we must respect and include their behaviors, their view of the
                    world, and their own ethics. As students, we must work to liberate our education
                    from antiquated economic and institutional structures; we must liberate our
                    instructors from paper-based assessment that attempts to fix academic output as
                    a single assignment rather than a dynamic development process; by embracing a
                    collaborative, project based pedagogy, we must reject the simplistic
                            “‘banking’ concept of education” that presumes
                    education is deposited in the heads of students from a teacher [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#freire2005">Freire 2005</a>, 72]; we must liberate ourselves from traditional
                    and conservative models of education that are predicated on rarified access to
                    resources and information. The banking concept of education is invalidated by
                    the Open Access model that makes content free. When paired with similar Open
                    Source and Open Data movements, access to open standards and data allows
                    non-traditional scholars to participate like never before. As Freire reminds us,
                    true liberation comes when the oppressors as well as the oppressed are liberated
                    from the structural inequalities that propagate and reward hierarchies of
                    control and dominance. Teaching our students to build digital projects will
                    validate digital scholarship for faculty and staff as well. Crossing between
                    these spaces should not carry with it the hierarchies of the university's own
                    evaluative procedures.</div>

                    of culture, there lies a split between the mechanical and the human that
                    animates our collaborative relationships. The UCLA “Student
                        Collaborators’ Bill of Rights” defines the necessity to pay students
                    for their work, arguing that an unpaid internship model should not merely
                    exchange experience or education for labor.<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e681">[8]</a> Work and education cannot enter into an economics of
                    exchange or gift because the value exchanged is simply too ephemeral, prone to
                    abuse, and reliant on hierarchies of authority between faculty, students, and
                    staff that are symptomatic of the old academy. The UCLA Bill of Rights explains
                    this division with a pragmatic sensibility: “If students have made substantive (i.e.,
                            non-mechanical) contributions to the project, their names should appear
                            on the project as collaborators, and they should be acknowledged in
                            subsequent publications that stem from the project”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#dipressind">Di Pressi et al.</a>]. Student labor and education should not become merely an extension of the
                    computational tools researchers are taking up. Large scale XML/TEI projects may
                    well be the most susceptible research method because of the labor required. The
                    extensibility of the language may become extended uncomfortably into our
                    pedagogy; the structural demands of encoding text re-encodes personal
                    relationships and builds a human ethics through the demands of the machine.
                    Jaron Lanier’s <cite class="title italic">You are Not a Gadget</cite> does well to
                    describe how “the most important thing about technology is how it
                            changes people”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#lanier2010">Lanier 2010</a>, 4]. While his argument is dystopian in tone and scope, Lanier rightly argues
                    that people sacrifice some portion of their intellect and their very humanity to
                    serve the limitations of computing. Teachers, as well as students, are
                    susceptible to the extensibility of this ethic. Digital humanities runs the
                    risks of translating the structural logic of the machine onto the human
                    experience of our students. People become the mere workings of the machines now
                    used for analysis and knowledge generation. For this reason, we suggest that
                    contributorship must be modeled on conditions and ethics that are inherited from
                    the humanities. </div>

                    of graduate students or lab directors, or present a simple alphabetized list, do
                    not translate well into digital humanities. Insights offered by constituent

                    collaboratively in a multimedia and multidisciplinary context. Authorship
                    occupies potentially-competing modes of credit and accountability. In
                    recognition of this tension, collaboration allows project contributors with
                    diverse expertise to define their roles and to apportion mutually-beneficial
                    responsibility. There are several models to document and attribute diverse
                    contributions made in a heterogeneous team. TaDiRAH and CrediT are two of the
                    most commonly discussed currently in digital humanities and scholarly
                        communication,<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e735">[9]</a> though it is
                    unclear just how often these taxonomies are employed (Brand). TaDiRAH cites the
                    Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) and The Digital
                    Research Tools project (DiRT) as employing the framework. Collaboration disrupts
                    existing models of authorship and attribution. Greater transparency is possible
                    with these taxonomies; however, collaborative teams evolve as expertise
                    increases and roles shift as students or faculty come in and out of the project.
                    Activity definitions, like those used by <a href="https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/blob/master/reference/activities.md" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/blob/master/reference/activities.md'); return false" class="ref">TaDiRAH</a> represent just one side of the story that includes

                    history and narrative come to define our model.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">As we discussed at the opening, our perspective emerged during our participation
                    in the Mellon-funded Scholarly Communication Institute (SCI) hosted by the
                    Research Triangle of North Carolina from the 11th to the 15th of October, 2015.
                    Our discussions during this week centered on digital humanities work as a
                    community of practice, wherein the community is formed by the very methods and
                    techniques employed. TaDIRAH includes “community_building”
                    and “teaching_and_learning” in the taxonomy of activities,
                    but these roles do not map easily to student participation and define what
                    constitutes these acts. During the week at SCI, we were engaged on multiple
                    levels of community building and teaching and learning, but these activities
                    were difficult to capture in the current taxonomies. We turned to building a
                    timeline with Timeline.js to show how our thought evolved. We built a <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/amm81/sci" onclick="window.open('http://www.personal.psu.edu/amm81/sci'); return false" class="ref">project site</a> to capture
                    our collaboratively written white paper, which used Google Docs to shape our
                    team’s discussions. We strove to have our project site reflect the fluidity of
                    born digital content, which evinces different issues related to credit, to
                    valuing varied contributions, and the articulation of participation in our
                    thinking. The romantic ideal of the solitary genius and the writer in his garret
                    was transparent to us as we worked in a multimedia environment, rapidly picking
                    up tasks, and sharing information. The taxonomies of contributorship faded as we
                    grappled with collecting our conversation. The timeline of our thinking includes
                    tweets from group members and digital photographs of our activity, many of which
                    were taken by Eric Dye. We argue for a radical inclusiveness that recognises the
                    very real labor of contributors that may manifest in a variety of ways. This is
                    a model of digital scholarship that is interested in the big picture of academia
                    intersecting with the public and of pedagogy existing as research. Knowledge is
                    a networked thing, and conceiving of scholarship as an inherently collaborative
                    venture enriches the people and the products of any given field. Having begun
                    in-depth discussion of theoretical issues, we realised that our key insights to
                    discussions of how to evaluate digital work emerged from extensive practical
                    knowledge. To expand on those insights, we developed a number of project-based
                    case studies that highlighted the collaboration behind them. These case studies
                    might serve as models for further study to gain information on more widespread
                    practices in digital scholarship.</div>

                    investigator, and student collaborator. These case studies work from the
                    understanding that a granular approach to contribution, as would be captured in
                    a metric that simply counted GitHub commits, would not appreciate the
                    contributions of individuals who may have provided a critical insight or
                    discovery that shaped the evolution of our projects. We found that historical
                    accounting of activities helped lay bare the methodological decisions of each
                    group as they evolved. Our realization in our heterogeneous group was that there
                    are layers of dependences between technology and expertise that foregrounds
                    students, staff, and faculty roles in a highly variable way. We found that a
                    mentorship model that flattened hierarchies between participants allowed for a
                    fuller sense of participation and a holistic representation of the insights

                        students and faculty at the college. Hosted by the Penn State Digital
                        Humanities Lab, 12th Street collects the history, culture, and contemporary
                        voices of those living in Erie, PA. The project takes its name from an
                        industrial corridor in Erie that has been lined with factories and
                        businesses throughout the region’s history. We take 12th Street as a
                        microcosm of the social, cultural, and economic forces that have shaped the
                        region since the mid-19th century. Together we are charting the history of
                        the region in an effort to imagine its potential futures. Developed on Omeka
                        and the Neatline add-on, 12th Street is a local geographical history of the
                        region that appeals to a global audience. The campus has recently developed
                        an undergraduate major program in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology,
                        otherwise known as DIGIT. The program positions undergraduate research
                        opportunities at the core of the curriculum and necessitates open and
                        dynamic collaboration. The major is organized around four media specific
                        concentrations that include text analysis, sound design and film production,
                        data visualization, and modeling and simulation. 12th Street is capable of
                        accommodating a wide range of multimedia contributions and maintain
                        coherence through its dedication to explaining the relationship between
                        space and place as well as culture and economy. The project is intended to
                        grow organically with the interests of participating faculty and students.
                        An emphasis on creative works may emerge with the contributions of
                        participating creative writing faculty, or an emphasis on visual history may
                        develop over time with the contributions of our arts and humanities faculty
                        and students. </div>

                        Jenkins has developed. It encompasses a visual and textual report that
                        detailed how the Erie Masonic Temple’s survival and development represents a
                        template for the evolution of the city and the region. Jenkins encountered
                        difficulties in finding a relevant original documentation, so she began
                        networking outside of the library system. Eventually, she connected with an
                        individual within one of the Temple’s Masonic bodies that had collected
                        documents throughout the years in an aim to have the Temple listed as a
                        historic site. This documentation, combined with the other minimal
                        information she had scrounged from the libraries and online, provided her
                        with the foundation for her project. She then contributed photographs and a
                        personal narrative of what the building looks like today. Joining the
                        historical documents with the present conditions enabled her to explain a
                        narrative of the broader social and cultural importance of the building.
                        Because Eric came to his contributions with a pre-existing expertise in
                        photography, his methodological focus embraced photography. Jenkins came to
                        her research with a robust background in journalism and public scholarship.
                        She was able to locate unique resources by directly engaging with knowledge
                        stakeholders and current users of the space. While Dye and Jenkins worked on
                        their own component of the project, they were able to chart each other’s
                        progress on Yammer and celebrate each other’s milestones. In this way, the

                        pull up poles to support the larger structure. Through their individual
                        efforts, they build a community of practice that shifts and evolves with the
                        interests of the student contributors and the skills offered by faculty

                        Schroder (‘17), Jennifer Filak (‘16), and Grace Gamble (‘17)–also worked in
                        Basecamp so that they might raise questions about transcription publicly;
                        Burch, Heil, and Stephen Flynn (at the time, Wooster’s Emerging Technologies
                        LIbrarian) found in these questions opportunities to discuss editorial
                        practice, the idiosyncrasies of books made during the handpress period of
                        printing, and about structured markup. Regarding the latter of these, Flynn
                        designed a “pre-TEI” workflow so that students would have
                        a gentle introduction to angle brackets without getting in the way of the
                        transcription itself. The students were exposed to light markup that Flynn
                        then transformed into valid TEI via scripts and ported it into an interface
                        like TEI Boilerplate. Finally, a senior computer science student was hired
                        for a few weeks simply to explore TEI Boilerplate: Douglas Code was tasked
                        only with exploring creative, project-specific hacks to the Boilerplate code
                        and in his brief time on the project was able to create a table of contents
                        to facilitate ease of reading.</div>

                        editors transcribing the text, a librarian creating a technical framework, a
                        student coder/hacker, a faculty member, and the Five Colleges’ Digital
                        Scholar. To this point, Heil had been framing the project at the topmost
                        level by suggesting tools and frameworks like TEI and Basecamp, and by
                        guiding overall project timelines based on planning meetings, expressed
                        goals, and local resources. For his part the project was an experiment
                        designed to help us walk through the role of TEI in our transcription
                        projects on the Liberal Arts campus. Additionally, however, Heil was also
                        attempting to find partners in computer science who might save the project
                        from manual transcription by tailoring the optical character recognition
                        (OCR) workflows designed as a part of the Early Modern OCR Project (eMOP) at
                        Texas A&amp;M University. Professor Sofia Visa introduced an optional
                        assignment in her machine learning class and recruited Will Rial, a rising
                        senior at Wooster who worked over the summer tailor these workflows. (Rial
                        has presented talks and posters and has a forthcoming publication on his
                        design.) Next steps for the project will include close collaboration between
                        Rial and a French Language and Literature student to further refine the OCR
                        outputs so that the final four books in de Scudéry’s oeuvre can be OCR’d
                        effectively. The result of the project is not just machine- and
                        human-readable texts, but it will also contribute to the digital humanities
                        world’s knowledge base on the OCR technologies and processes that are
                        essentially to freeing the millions of pages of human cultural artifacts

                        expedient series of collaborations. In the aforementioned partnership
                        between libraries, students, faculty members, and an #altac facilitator,
                        each party brought their expertise to the table and, importantly, informed
                        the project’s processes in meaningful ways. Additionally, Heil sought an
                        opportunity for a “coincidental collaboration” in which
                        Visa and Rial could use data from Burch et al. to inform their project, the
                        result of which would benefit Burch’s original pedagogical goal without
                        rendering this goal dependent upon the results of the computer science
                        intervention. That is to say that two viable digital, pedagogical projects
                        worked along parallel paths, along which each stakeholder contributed her or
                        his creative and specialized solution to the research questions at hand.
                        Along the way, Digital Scudéry will have deliverables: preservation-quality
                        TEI documents, the potential for a digital edition of Scudéry’s work,
                        machine-readable text that can be utilized in the classroom for pedagogical
                        experiments in text mining, introductory TEI workflows for encoding
                        projects, OCR processes for printed seventeenth-century French books, and
                        post-processing scripts to clean the OCR output. The project also
                        exemplifies ethical interdisciplinary, interdivisional collaborations at two
                        different scales while it introduces more possibilities for collaboration in
                        the near term: Heil hopes to fold the lessons learned into processes that
                        can result in whole-campus collaborations that formally knit together
                        faculty teaching, student research, and library and educational
                        technologies’ technical acumen. It is a version of interdisciplinary
                        collaboration that is facilitated at the level of an academic
                        superstructure–here, the Ohio Five, the library, the Ed Tech division–rather
                        than at the level of individual faculty researcher(s).</div>

                        intellectual community, is devoted to understanding, critiquing, and
                        building digital projects for the study of the Renaissance. These aims
                        ensure that the scope and significance of individual and institutional
                        contributions are maximised across the scholarly community of interest. ReKN
                        directly addresses the growing challenge of diverse, isolated, and siloed
                        digital resources by building a scholarly environment explicitly tailored to
                        the needs of humanities scholars studying the Renaissance. ReKN seeks to
                        bring existing scholarly resources and methods into conversation by
                        integrating research, discovery, exploration, analysis, and visualisation.
                        ReKN will take shape at the intersection of the initiatives, projects, and
                        trends outlined above, providing a single point of entry into an entire
                        galaxy of scholarly activity, specialised for and oriented to scholars of
                        the Renaissance. It is a resource for searching and discovering, for
                        analysing and exploring, and for publishing and writing. And in all of these
                        diverse activities we are cognisant of the many ways the community is
                        formed, collaboration occurs, and research is shared and debated. ReKN is
                        being developed from its inception to encompass the ways that not only
                        researchers interact with each other, but the many ways in which digital
                        resources and tools benefit from interoperability and cross communication.
                        ReKN is at once a unique technological resource, a focal point for diverse
                        digital resources, and a community–of individuals, of practice, and of
                        scholarly work. It is a social, scholarly working environment and a
                        community of users, researchers, developers, the public, datasets, projects,
                        publications, and networks.</div>

                        and institutions, with many members of the team frequently on the road for
                        conference travel. While this afforded some benefits, it also produced
                        difficulties in communication and decision making. Skype conferences, for
                        example, were difficult to schedule between Europe, Toronto, and Victoria,
                        and as a result were usually several hours in length when finally scheduled.
                        We also found that different work styles and personalities made project
                        coordination difficult at times, especially as concerned software and
                        platform deliverables. We also found that the local and individual needs of
                        the graduate students hired as research assistants often meant that they did
                        not want to intellectual “own” the project. The issues
                        faced by the project with regard to geographical distance and community
                        development is evidence of how a project, with the stated goal of community
                        formation, must actively work to shape that culture internally. The
                        collaborative cultures that we attempt to build on platforms like ReKN must
                        be echoed in the teams that develop the software as well. </div>

                        Mount St. Helens since the 1980 eruption, the 23 students in this course
                        began, in August 2014, to research interactive installations relating to
                        environmental phenomena. Exploring science museums, educational facilities,
                        art galleries, and museums from around the world, they assembled a
                        collection of 50 exhibits. They studied these examples using the constraints
                        provided them by the scientists at the Station (e.g. size, portability, wide
                        audience interest) developing a comparative analysis that captured the
                        students’ observations. The next stage of the project’s development had them
                        creating their own exhibit. Using their research, students prepared a
                        proposal for the way in which their exhibit would look and function and
                        delivered this proposal to the scientists in a formal presentation. The end
                        product was the “Life Renewed,” an educational
                        environment that includes a mobile app and an interactive installation that
                        provides a 3D simulated flyover of the volcano, two augmented reality
                        banners that reveal 2D hand-made illustrations and 3D animation models, and
                        a touch screen interface for identifying plants and animals found on the
                        mountain. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Once the scientists accepted the students’ plan, production on the exhibit
                        began. The students assembled into four teams based on interests and skills:
                        1) Animation/Video/GIS, 2) Augmented Reality/Interface Design, 3) Web and
                        Mobile, and 4) Digital Marketing and Promotions. Each team worked to develop
                        their own portion of the project, interacting with the scientists and other
                        teams as they created their digital artifacts. Using GIS data, the Animation
                        Team mapped 289 square miles of the volcano in 3D and created a game
                        simulation in which visitors to the exhibit take the persona of a raven
                        flying over the various terrains of Mount St. Helens and observing the
                        animals and plants of that specific area of rebirth. Students also produced
                        hand-made 3D animations of the animals and 2D scientific illustrations of
                        the plants used for the augmented reality environment. The students on the
                        Web and Mobile team built the computer used to power the simulation and
                        produced a large screen and mobile version of it. The Design Team made the
                        augmented reality banners and produced the educational booklet that
                        accompanied the exhibit to be made available to visitors at the Station. The
                        Digital Marketing Team developed and maintained the website that documents
                        the production of the project and hosts many of its assets. Once completed,
                        the exhibit was installed at the Station in celebration of the 35th
                        anniversary of the eruption and remained on site until August 2015. So
                        successful was this project that it won two 1st place awards for
                        undergraduate research and has continued to be exhibited at events, like the
                        recent Portland mini-Maker Faire (Oregon Museum for Science and Industry,
                        September 2015) and Girlfest (Girl Scouts of Oregon and SW Washington,
                        October 2015). While students came to this project with strong technological

                        work collaboratively on teams, to communicate in both written and oral
                        contexts effectively to a variety of audiences––from students, to
                        scientists, to the public––and solve a real-world problem that came with a
                        healthy amount of responsibility and stress. These are the skill sets that
                        help them stand out on the job market and explains why the hiring rate for
                        the program stands at 90%. More importantly, students learn first hand what
                        it means to be part of a community. The team structure encourages this
                        understanding at a micro level as students working with other students, but
                        the collaboration with one another, the faculty, and the scientists to build
                        something of intellectual value for the public teaches students what it
                        means to be citizens of the world. </div>

                    technological or infrastructural per se. Instead, they are social, habituated by
                    longstanding disciplinary norms and expectations. They are deeply embedded in
                    administrative norms and processes, from informal expectations to the literal
                    paperwork used within universities. They find expression in tenure and promotion
                    guidelines or traditions that ignore or disincentivize collaborative work and
                    processes, frame digital scholarship as service, or overemphasize the
                        “final product” of digital scholarship. In evaluation
                    frameworks like the Research Excellence Framework in the United Kingdom or the
                    Excellence in Research for Australia, we can observe the nationalization of
                    these standards in an attempt to repatriate scholarship into the limited roles
                    of training a citizenry, which continue to overvalue monographs in rigid
                    point-based systems that determine funding. We see these disciplinary norms in
                    requirements for depositing dissertations as PDFs that often preclude digital
                    work outside that limiting file format. The habits of student evaluation and
                    curriculum development further disincentivize faculty from engaging their
                    students in collaborative teams and training undergraduates and graduates to
                    complete digital projects. Students see faculty trumpeting the arrival of their
                    new book and using it as a calling card for their expertise, while eliding the
                    pressures of tenure and promotion. Finally, students run the risk of emulating
                    these worn out modes of scholarly communication and sacrificing their education
                    to repeat the cycle. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30"> Through our case studies, we hope to narrativize how a project's processes,
                    participation patterns, and outcomes can cast these formally and informally
                    institutionalized values in relief. At its core, the approach is humanistic: we
                    tell the stories of our projects in an attempt to glimpse the connectedness that
                    holds true collaboration and ethical distribution of credit as a core value. Our
                    case studies bring to light our attempts at flattened hierarchies and, within
                    such a two-dimensional model, the sites of overlapping knowledge and abilities
                    that are sewn together into the fabric of our projects. To return to Ratto’s
                    terminology, our approach embraces its “seamfulness”
                    [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#ratto2007">Ratto 2007</a>]. The seamlessness of contemporary consumer
                    electronics contains a rhetoric that elides the process of development, which we
                    argue is the key moment when new knowledge and insights are created. By
                    embracing the collaborative development as a core concern for digital humanities
                    pedagogy and research, we reject the consumerist privileging of a final product
                    and embrace an evolving model of social knowledge creation. As a development
                    ethos guiding projects, Chalmers and Galani describe an approach to interface
                    that “involves deliberately revealing seams to users, and
                            taking advantage of features usually considered as negative or
                            problematic”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#chalmers2004">Chalmers and Galani 2004</a>, 1]. For our purposes, the seam is not a failure but a redoubling that
                    results from layered, overlapping systems; our seams strengthen rather than
                    weaken interpersonal signals. Nevertheless, the seams are sites of contestation
                    in both Chalmers’s formulation and our adaptation thereof: in both instances,
                    the seam troubles the system and are “negative or
                        problematic.” Ratto pushes the logic of seam<em class="emph">fulness</em>
                    into an ethical domain by highlighting how consumers of seamless electronics
                    become “passive agents”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#ratto2007">Ratto 2007</a>, 24], who are unable to modify or repair the technology they purchase. The
                    ethics of seamlessness is an ethic of disempowerment. When we elide the seams
                    between teaching and research, our students become passive agents and mere
                    consumers of education. Giving them the awareness of the seams between teaching
                    and research allows them to take agency of their education. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="mauro-towards.html#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">As we think through the utility seamful design, there is a danger in adopting
                    tantalizingly figurative formulations: “Seamfully integrated tools would maintain the unique
                            characteristics of each tool, through transformations that retained
                            their individual characteristics”
                         [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#chalmers2004">Chalmers and Galani 2004</a>, 2]. While we certainly want to celebrate our “unique
                        characteristics,” the metaphor implies a problematic association
                    between the computational tools and those who use them. We want to continue to
                    push against that gadgetization of human contributorship that Lanier laments and
                    adapt a model that lays bare human networks of overlapping agency, displaying
                    the joints where our projects become knit together. Dean Rehberger, the Director
                    of Matrix at Michigan State University, has helpfully defined Digital Humanities
                    as quilting [<a class="ref" href="mauro-towards.html#rehberger2014">Rehberger 2014</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="mauro-towards.html#d14887e937">[10]</a>
                    Perhaps, if we stretch the needlecraft metaphor even further, we might think of
                    it instead as a motley patchwork of projects that comprise the canvas for our
                    big tent view of DH. We can strengthen that fabric with intentional, ethically
                    designed knowledge networks that, when viewed through a humanistic lens, get us
                    closer (as a large community of practice) to evaluative structures that allow
                    for responsible, care-full accreditation and that foster intentional growth
                    rather than sprawl.</div>

                        rebuttal to the initial enthusiasm for the term. Somewhat tellingly, the
                        conversation about the term occurred largely in blogs, like that of Henry

                        form his rough analogy between digital nativists and immigrants. By 2011,
                        Michael Thomas was able to edit an anthology tasked with <cite class="title italic">Deconstructing Digital Natives</cite>. The term had
