                <p> This essay presents an approach to teaching Digital Humanities through two
                    largely unexplored lenses: electronic literature and foreign languages (Spanish
                    in particular). It offers a practical example of a course taught during the
                    Spring of 2016 at UC Berkeley that combines literary analysis with the teaching
                    of basic programming skills, and DH tools and methods. Concretely, this course
                    is an upper division, undergraduate writing intensive class, where students
                    learn how to write and talk about electronic literature–e.g. hypertext novels,
                    kinetic poetry, automatic generators, social media fictions, etc.–, learning
                    specific terminology and theoretical frameworks, as they gain the skills to
                    build their own digital art pieces in a collaborative workshop setting. By
                    taking this course as a practical example, this essay tackles three important
                    pillars in the humanities. Firstly, the overall concept of literature, and more
                    specifically, the literary; secondly, what we understand by literary studies at
                    the university; and thirdly, and more broadly, what constitutes cultural (beyond
                    technical) literacy in the twenty–first century. This essay’s final claim is
                    that teaching e-it as DH effectively address all three.</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital Humanities is not a new field in U.S. universities. Spread across different
                disciplines, it has also been commonly hosted in English departments. Perhaps due to
                the long association between computers and composition, most DH practices are
                founded on the belief that “after numerical input, text is the most traceable type of
                        data for computers to manipulate”
                     [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#kirchenbaum2011">Kirschenbaum 2011</a>]. Going beyond the instrumentality of data analysis, in this essay I want to
                propose an approach to teaching Digital Humanities in its relation to literary
                studies through two largely unexplored lenses: electronic literature and foreign
                languages (Spanish in particular, although this methodology can be applied to other
                languages). This pedagogical proposal is based on the belief that the range of
                cultural literacies that are involved in digital reading and writing
                competencies—plus the added value of learning how to work collaboratively in a
                community of practice—are better served in a foreign language environment than in a
                purely English literature department. I present a practical example of a course I
                have developed and taught during the Spring of 2016 at UC Berkeley that combines
                literary analysis with the teaching of basic programming skills, and DH tools and
                methods. Cross–listed between the Spanish and Portuguese Department and the Berkeley
                Center for New Media, this is an upper division, undergraduate writing intensive
                class, where students learn how to write and talk about electronic literature—e.g.
                hypertext novels, kinetic poetry, automatic generators, social media fictions,
                etc.—, learning specific terminology and theoretical frameworks, as they gain the
                skills to build their own digital art pieces in a collaborative workshop setting.
                    “Electronic Literature: A Critical Making &amp; Writing
                    Course” is a semester long course that incorporates academic research
                tools and resources, together with practical, hands-on work. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Before going into the specifics of this course—in order to delimit the many ways
                    there are to talk about digital prose and poetry—in this essay I follow the
                    definition provided by the Electronic Literature Organization by which
                        <em class="term">electronic literature</em> (e-lit) “refers to works with important literary aspects that
                            take advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the
                            stand–alone or networked computer”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#elitorg">Electronic Literature Organization n.d.</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e211">[1]</a> Works of fiction such as a hypertextual or
                    an interactive novel, or a multimedia piece of poetry that requires the
                    scrolling, clicking and decision making of the user in order to be read, would
                    be paradigmatic examples of this peculiar type of DH literature. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">These types of electronic works, which are also commonly known as
                        <em class="term">born–digital</em> literature, essentially describe literary texts
                    that were conceived in a computer to be performed on a computer, and that would
                    lose a lot of their expressive signification when printed—being thus works of
                    literature (a classic discipline in the humanities) as well as digital media
                    objects. Moreover, since these texts demand the active participation of the
                    reader in “non–trivial” ways, <em class="emph">reading</em> becomes a
                    full body experience that requires different competencies from those involved in
                    reading traditional print.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e228">[2]</a>

                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Likewise, the reading and writing of digital works, mostly distributed
                    online—together with the work of a community of collaborative e-lit
                    producers—has challenged established <em class="emph">literary</em> concepts such as
                        “author,”
                    “authorship,”
                    “work,” and even the act of reading itself, now fluctuating
                    between distances and depths of reading.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e257">[3]</a> There is an increasing number of publications engaging in the
                    redefinition of these key topics, assuming that we are indeed experiencing a
                    digital turn in literary practice, and we have started to emphasize the use of
                    digital tools to be applied to literary texts, as seen by the affirmation of
                    hosting DH courses in English departments. This is undeniable, but while we have
                    developed and made some progress on the <em class="term">application</em> of digital
                    tools to literary texts—inevitably treating the latter as informational and
                    quantifiable data—, we seem to have been less interested in determining what
                    sort of <em class="term">competencies</em> are necessary, not to read digital texts
                        <em class="emph">as</em> data, but to explore the <em class="term">literary values</em> of
                    those texts that were born digital in the first place. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the
                        Literary</cite>, N. Katherine Hayles began to explore the opportunities
                    that the teaching of born digital literature had for other fields such as
                    computation. Although she was addressing the Computer Science community rather
                    than the DH one directly, she explained that just as networked and programmable
                    digital media were transforming literature, so were literary effects
                    reevaluating computational practice by reveling in the recursive feedback loops
                    involved in the embodied practice, the tacit knowledge and the explicit
                    articulation that happened in both spheres. She acknowledged, nevertheless, that
                    traditional print literature had also created similar recursive loops, but e-lit
                    also performed “the additional function of entwining human ways of
                            knowing with machine cognitions”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#hayles2008">Hayles 2008</a>]. By exploring the tension between the high-level meanings of human
                    discourse and the cascading processes linked with executable code in machines we
                    realize how ideas, when performed by digital media, “become more than disembodied concepts, emotions signify
                            as more than irrational fleeting sensations, coded algorithms connect
                            with human intuitions, and machine cognitions promiscuously mingle with
                            conscious and embodied knowledges”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#hayles2008">Hayles 2008</a>]. By the same token, computation becomes a powerful way “to reveal to us the implications of our contemporary
                            situation, creating revelations that work within and beneath conscious
                            thought”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#hayles2008">Hayles 2008</a>]. Computation ceases to be a technical practice only to become a method of
                    exploring the dynamics of our contemporary digital situation, and our ways of
                    creating art within it. Thus, the lessons that are being taught when engaging
                    with the teaching of born-digital works concern directly the computer science
                    field, but should also interest us as (digital) humanists. </div>

                    essay, but it is important to stress at this point that the e-lit course that I
                    am proposing as a means of teaching Digital Humanities, while evidently
                    respecting these definitions and concerns, is built on two further controversial
                    assumptions. On the one hand, the belief that e-lit is a field, not only of
                    creative practice, but also worthy of pedagogical infrastructure within the
                    University, and on the other, the assertion that there is a
                        <em class="term">community</em> of individuals interested in its pedagogical
                    development—albeit in many different roles. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Describing this e-lit community is, however, even more complicated than defining
                    its object and its relation to DH, and for the purposes of this essay I will
                    refer broadly to all those individuals whose (artistic or academic) practice
                    revolves around e-lit in one way or another, but who essentially understand that
                    the intersection of digital technologies and writing has revolutionized our
                    comprehension of three established pillars in the humanities. Firstly, the
                    overall concept of literature, and more specifically, the <em class="term">literary</em>;
                    secondly, what we understand by <em class="term">literary studies</em> at the university;
                    and thirdly, and more broadly, what constitutes cultural (beyond technical)
                        <em class="term">literacies</em> in the twenty-first century. I will begin my
                    argumentation by describing the second and third points before concluding with
                    the importance of treating the digital <em class="term">literary</em> under a media
                    specific framework for the benefit of our humanistic inquiries around
                    literature, but essentially, teaching e-lit as DH—<em class="emph">and </em>in a foreign
                    language environment—effectively addresses all three. </div>

                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#dhberkeleynd">Digital Humanities at Berkeley n.d.</a>]. Up until now, DH at Berkeley has funded the development of 18 new
                    courses combining digital approaches to disciplines as varied as Political
                    Science and Theater, Dance and Performance Studies.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e353">[4]</a> One of these new courses, “Electronic Literature: A Critical Making and Writing Course,” is a
                    Spanish language writing intensive workshop on e-lit that encourages the
                    practice of DH tools and methods (hands-on digital hacking) in hopes of
                    developing new theories of the digital literary, as well as exploring how e-lit
                    can help us reevaluate computational practices.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e359">[5]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Likewise, seeking to implement a coherent methodology of teaching, “Electronic Literature: A Critical Making and Writing
                        Course” is structured according to a hermeneutics particular to
                    Digital Humanities. Similar to what Diane Jackaki and Katie Faull suggested in
                    their presentation at the DH15 conference, “Pedagogical
                        Hermeneutics and Teaching DH in a Liberal Arts Context”
                    [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#jackaki2015">Jackaki and Faull 2015</a>], this e-lit course is built around a DH pedagogy
                    based on practice, discovery, and, most importantly in my case, community.
                    Setting practice at the heart of pedagogical hermeneutics implies, in turn, that
                    this DH course should emphasize experimentation and discovery (of digital tools
                    and computational principles), but also, in the case of e-lit, their emerging
                    poetic relations. To this end, we need to analyze poetic or narrative objects,
                    and at the same time pay close attention to the material and technical
                    conditions that make them possible: How does their underlying code work? Was the
                    poem built on a particular program? Does it require proprietary software to be
                    read? Can a hypertext novel be read by any operating system? etc. Although we
                    all know of the importance of print in literary history, thinking about the
                    materials behind a poem or story is not something we tend to highlight when
                    teaching language or literature. Conversely, material affordances and media
                    constraints come quickly to the fore when working with digital poetry and its
                    flickering, glitchy, or obsolete qualities, for instance—and not only when it
                    stops working.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">“Electronic Literature: A Critical Making and Writing
                        Course,” thus seeks to explore the previously mentioned issues and
                    methods. It is divided in two correlating modules as indicated by its title:
                    critical writing and critical making. The first module deals mainly with
                    improving students’ foreign language writing skills and critical analysis of
                    aspects particular to electronic literature: changes in authorship models
                    (cyborg authorship and posthumanism, for example), questions of originality
                    (unoriginal genius, remix, etc.), challenges in textual ontology (code ontology
                    vs. print ontology), variations in narrative structures (hypertext vs. linear
                    narrative) among many others. Exploring original e-lit works that enact these
                    theoretical concepts helps students materialize their understanding. For
                    instance, by reading the Spanish-language blog-fiction <cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">Más respeto que soy tu madre,</span></cite>
                    we are able to experience how the supposed blog author, a middle aged
                    Argentinean housewife writing about her hardships during the country’s financial
                    crisis, is really nothing but a parodied avatar created by the popular writer
                    Hernán Casciari; while by reading Loss Pequeño Glazier’s hypermedia narrative,
                        <cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">Territorio
                        Libre</span></cite>, we experience the narrator’s fragmented travels
                    through Cuba as we sense how the island’s digital culture depends on local
                    histories and individual experiences as much as it is shaped (and similarly
                    fragmented) by the availability of material infrastructures, commerce and the
                    State.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Further, by being cross-listed between the Berkeley Center for New Media and the
                    Department of Spanish and Portuguese, the course improves students’ reading and
                    writing skills in Spanish through the reading and writing of critical essays
                    both in English and Spanish. <a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e388">[6]</a> To accompany the experiencing of Casciari’s
                    fiction, students are encouraged to read critical works such as Daniel
                    Escandell’s essays (in Spanish) on avatars and blogs, for instance, and to
                    complement the experiences on the hypertextual structures of <cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">Territorio libre</span></cite>
                    students are presented with Borges’s short story <cite class="title italic">The Garden
                        of Forking Paths</cite> (either in English or Spanish) as well as Espen
                    Aarseth’s seminal <cite class="title italic">Cybertext. Perspectives on Ergodic
                        Literature</cite> (in English). Finally, and to continue with this example,
                    students would be asked to reflect on their readings by writing a short critical
                    commentary on how fragmentation could be used for creative writing by analyzing
                    some exceptional uses of social media platforms (as in Casciari’s work) or
                    writing software (as in Pequeño Glazier’s custom-made platform) that go beyond
                    their creator’s purpose. Students would be encouraged to find a work of e-lit
                    that exploits these characteristics, describe what they see, and evaluate how
                    successful the work is in taking advantage of the technical affordances of the
                    medium. As can be seen, these types of written assignments are aimed at
                    exercising students’ presentational and analytical skills, as well as reflecting
                    on the importance of reading in mediating our digital experience. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">The writing of e-lit, however, is an interdisciplinary endeavor, and different
                    genres require different skills. Hence the second module of the course
                    incorporates the learning of DH tools and methods related to some important
                    e-lit genres: Kinetic Poetry, Permutators and Generators, Hypertext Narratives,
                    Geo-Location Literature, Augmented Reality Texts, and Social Media Fictions. All
                    students are introduced to each genre’s main functionalities, languages, and
                    their poetic and artistic applications and history, but they only specialize in
                    building one particular piece for their final projects. Nevertheless, thanks to
                    weekly workshops, students would have been building prototypes of different
                    e-lit pieces, such as hypertextual narratives built on Twine, kinetic GIF works,
                    remixed poems built around existing generators like Nick Montfort’s famous
                        <cite class="title italic">Taroko Gorge</cite>, and spatial narratives built on
                    mapping and timeline software such as Findery or StoryMaps. Further, by
                    workshopping their own digital pieces, students gain scholarly insights only
                    obtained by participating in this type of practice-based, community exercise of
                    learning competencies. As students engage with these different tools and
                    platforms, they collectively share their work-in-progress in both a shared class
                    website and their own personal blogging spaces, shaping their own e-lit
                    community of practice, as well as intersecting the global net-based
                        network.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e411">[7]</a>

                    paradigmatic sample of students’ final projects includes: a hypermedia narrative

                    couple of geospatial narratives built on the ArcGIS StoryMaps platform that
                    recount stories of sexual harassment and assault of women around the world

                    fiction built on the design system Inform7 recreating the restrictive,
                    claustrophobic (and intentionally boring) world of office work to explore the
                    restrictions imposed on literary creativity in Spanish when using a programing
                    language originally based on natural (English) language (Kevin Chen’s <cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">Tu oficina</span></cite>); a

                    that allows users to create community-based narratives and poetry using Twitter
                    and SMS messaging, inspired by the games of subconscious creativity made famous

                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Teaching this type of modular course involves a set of pedagogical challenges,
                    both theoretical and technical. It is not a question of simply theorizing about
                    the changes in authorship or originality, but also exercising technical
                    requirements involved in the construction of those topics. Thus, the course is
                    built around a workshop model, broadly inspired by Miriam Posner’s DH
                    experiments with “How Did They Make That?” where the
                    UCLA professor dissects paradigmatic DH projects to help her students get
                    started with their own work [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#posner2013">Posner 2013</a>]. This pedagogical
                    proposal is interdisciplinary in nature and is built by the addition of
                    different experiences and skills, underscoring the concept of
                        “community.” Incorporating this in the case of e-lit
                    requires the participation of several instructors, specialized in different
                    tools or capacities: a Python specialist, a professor of literary theory, a
                    Twitter bot guru, etc. In its ideal form, the course would invite multiple
                    instructors to the classroom, exposing students to alternative skills, literary
                    proposals, and teaching styles, forging a “teaching
                        community” reflecting the “creative community”
                    behind professional e-lit online.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e471">[8]</a> Hence
                    teaching this type of course is not focused on <em class="term">knowledges</em> or
                        <em class="term">skills,</em> but on the ability to reach solutions to particular
                    problems, and its content will depend heavily on the actual student composition
                    of the class (modules will vary substantially if the majority of students come
                    from literature degrees or computer science backgrounds, for instance, focusing
                    more on structures or concepts accordingly). Taking into consideration the value
                    of previous knowledge and social evaluation, the teaching curriculum should be
                    determined on a case-by-case basis, just as it would in a professional, online,
                    e-lit setting. Correspondingly, a new challenge arises in selecting what type of
                    exercises and practices (rather than what type of tools and skills) should be
                    the most important in the development of reading and writing literacies within a
                    digital community. </div>

                    worst cases of pure content-based teaching, presenting uncontextualized tasks,
                    performances and demonstrations of skills. Although knowledge of the tasks and
                    skills involved in dealing with digital works will be necessary in order to be
                    digitally literate in a conceptual way, this type of operational literacy leaves
                    little room for student’s creativity. By contrast, conceptual definitions of

                    student’s internal construction of meaning, and on her or his desire and ability
                    to behave as an autonomous and different agent [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#diazcorralejo2013">Díaz-Corralejo and Brouté 2013</a>]. In other words, teaching competencies would categorize “to learn” as an

                        “apprentice researcher.” More likely than not, students
                    are assigned a project to improve certain knowledge or skills of their own,
                    while working on a faculty led project. In these cases, however, we do not

                    many communicative activities to the realm of our digital screens via text
                    messages or emails, but reading digitally has also been absorbed by popular
                    entertainment forms such as video games—not to mention more specialized
                    practices like machinima, digital animation, fanfiction writing, and the like.
                    As these become more and more complex, users are required to decipher new
                    patterns of narrativity that belong particularly to experiencing and advancing
                    in a digital story, which are very close to some current examples of e-lit.

                    have acknowledged the presence of literature DH courses in English departments,
                    perhaps due to the link between computing and composition that Kirschenbaum
                    suggested, when talking more precisely about e-lit, we are dealing with a type
                    of literature that moves easily between media, but also between languages,
                    between linguistic traditions, and thus a comparative framework may present
                    itself as a more suitable approach. Jessica Pressman has proposed this very
                    successfully, when she explains that electronic literature <em class="term">is</em>
                    Comparative Literature. “It is born digital; it operates across multiple machine
                            and human languages, and requires translation of these languages before
                            it even reaches the human reader”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>]. It is procedural and computational and is processed across multiple
                    platforms, protocols, and technologies, in accordance with the constraints and
                    technical specificities of hardware, software, and network configurations. E-lit
                    combines text, image, sound, movement, interactivity, and design, challenging
                    traditional disciplinary boundaries as well as genre categories [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>]. For these and other reasons, electronic literature
                    requires its reader to read and think comparatively, and thus e-lit should
                    naturally be read under a comparative literature lens. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Defending this comparative literature perspective to the teaching of born-digital
                    literature, Rebecca Walkowitz further compares it to what she calls
                        “born-translated” novels. These are works that have been
                    written for multiple world audiences in mind, sometimes published in several
                    languages at the same time, or in a language (usually English) other than the
                    native tongue of the writer in an exercise of “preemptive
                        translation.” She explains how this practice—the division of
                    writing and speaking languages in translation—was the expectation for late
                    medieval and early modern European writers who often circulated their work in
                    Latin in order to reach wider audiences and build communities of knowledge up
                    until the late eighteenth century, when the era of national languages and
                    literary traditions would be inaugurated [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#walkowitz2015">Walkowitz 2015</a>].
                    Although Walkowitz admits that we are still part of that era where “the expectation that the language of writing will match
                            the language of speech remains dominant”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#walkowitz2015">Walkowitz 2015</a>, 12], e-lit may take us back to a time before national languages and literary
                    traditions. The language, on this occasion, is not necessarily a natural one,
                    but a combination of those regional plus the addition of computation and the
                    non-linguistic signifiers, such as kinetic, aural and interactivity knowledges,
                    that come about e-lit production. More than talking about a given language, or
                    the comparison between two, we need to be thinking about the combination and
                    coexistence of <em class="emph">several languages.</em></div>

                    somewhere else that e-lit could be read as a Foreign Language Literature.
                    Precisely, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the e-lit field and the
                    multilayered qualities of the digital objects under study—and despite
                    Pressman’s, Walkowitz’s and Kirschenbaum’s claims—these courses give rise to
                    suspicion in both the English and Comparative Literature Departments, as well as
                    the Media Studies departments; e-lit not being literary enough for the first
                    two, but paying too much attention to poetics over media for the latter. E-lit
                    is something intrinsically hybrid, going beyond English or technical praxis, and
                    this hybridity is better served by being taught through competence-based models
                    of literacy than as a content-based literature course. My earlier claim of
                    teaching e-lit as DH literacy is what allows me to also claim that e-lit belongs
                    in Foreign Language Departments. After all, we are facing a type of literature
                    that <em class="emph">necessarily</em> combines different (semiotic) languages (sound,
                    movement, text), but also programming and formal languages (JavaScript, Perl,
                    Phyton, etc.) and natural languages that can be expressed in different tongues
                    (Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, etc.), that can or cannot be framed by any
                    single one of these languages’ literary traditions. Couldn’t we think of this
                    combination as a foreign language in itself? The ultimate <em class="emph">global</em>
                    language? If e-lit is seen as a foreign language, its teaching would easily fall
                    under foreign language departments’ responsibilities. </div>

                    the learning of these languages in a community setting, foreign language labs
                    are already a familiar setting where we have been, or should have been,
                    implementing similar teaching methodologies for many years—at least since the
                    pedagogical turn to communicative language teaching in the 1980s. These are
                    usually dynamic spaces habilitated with computers and video and audio devices
                    where students of different languages, coming from diverse classes and levels of
                    proficiency can go to learn individually and complete projects, meet as groups,
                    or join faculty in group activities without the rigidity of a fixed desk
                    environment. Language labs usually offer resources that complement formal
                    teaching, allowing students to pursue their individual interests like watching
                    films or listening to music of a given language that would not usually be part
                    of the language instruction curriculum. However, most of the language
                    instruction at the university level is still confined to the classroom,
                    considering lab activities as <em class="emph">additional</em> practice, not being really

                    able to foster collaborative work that uses the laboratory as “more than a space, but a symbol of our hopes”

                    about e-lit <em class="emph">in different languages.</em> Because the e-lit community is
                    intertwined with the global network it has been posed as essentially
                    international, belonging even to an earlier era of “preemptive
                        translation,” and “yet it is still the case that many communities are
                            emerging from and are responsive to national and language based literary

                    within, and not simply between communities. “In an age of global migration, it is impossible to know
                            all the languages or even to comprehend all versions of the same

                    literature: “Only a redistribution of concepts, a way of thinking
                            about the conditions of literary writing, will take us to a place, a

                        literary</em> different from the print-based model that is so thoroughly
                    embedded in the very idea of a world literature. Other equally embedded ideas,
                    he says, “like the ‘grand thought’ of freedom
                            (Brandes, Auerbach), and the yearning toward universality, also need to
                            be investigated in the conception of cyber visionaries no less than in
                            longtime scenarios of world literature”

                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Reinforcing my earlier claims, what is universal for Tabbi is no longer a single
                    world vision that necessarily transcends its national, racial, gendered, or
                    cultural origins. What is universal instead is the ability, by observing the
                    constraints on the current world system as it configures itself in our actual
                    digital writing spaces, to enter into meaningful conversations with other
                    creators in written (as well as non-written) forms. In this sense, world
                    literature, the digital networks that support it, and the social networks that
                    sustain it can be regarded as an alternative formation to globalization. What is
                        “literary” in this heterogeneous sample of world
                    literature can be recognized in this capacity to disturb the smooth operation of
                    global communications as Tabbi insists, using textual instruments whose
                    operations are largely conceptual. Indeed, one important accomplishment of e-lit
                    may have been to locate narrativity not as a literary universal but as one of
                    many qualities best realized in the particular medium of print [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#tabbi2010">Tabbi 2010</a>]. In this sense, digital media would not be a threat to
                    the life of books or literature, but would help us in a revaluation and
                    relocation of the literary in multiple media. At the same time, the question of
                    setting the digital literary as something experienceable <em class="emph">beyond</em>
                    language, supports the importance and utmost pertinence of thinking about e-lit
                    as something written, in practical terms, in <em class="emph">another language</em>—one
                    made of many, a born-collective language—as I am proposing here. </div>

                    moving through multiple spaces and languages as Tabbi reminds us, is what
                    defines the digital literary as something that goes beyond the human language of
                    choice (engaging frontally with digital literacy). I believe this framework
                    makes a strong case in support of the teaching of e-lit in foreign language
                    departments. This is a linguistic question, of course, but also an
                    administrative one, where highlighting the bureaucratic constraints over the
                    matter becomes very important. While e-lit has a foothold in academia, Rettberg
                    points out how most of the academic positions in the field are held by critics
                    or theorists while authors of electronic literature have been less likely to
                    find employment. Likewise, students have been allowed to write dissertations on
                    e-lit, but very few places (if any) would permit them to present their writing
                    as a work of electronic literature [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#rettberg2009">Rettberg 2009</a>].</div>

                    where materials, resources, and even collected works and anthologies are shared,
                    and where members of the community participate in conferences and publications
                    (perhaps scholarly based, but not necessarily). Although many people “are
                        inclined to believe that if something comes for free,” he explains “then it must be ‘valueless[,]’ [t]he history of the
                            twentieth century avant-garde is, however, replete with examples of
                            artistic and literary movements, notably the Dada and Fluxus, which
                            managed to have a great deal of lasting influence in spite of the fact
                            that they worked outside of the conventional cultural economy of their
                            day”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#rettberg2009">Rettberg 2009</a>]. Following this logic, Rettberg concludes that the best way to produce

                    the content of our curricula, but also how we teach and study said curricula,
                    something already underscored by much DH scholarship and activism.<a class="noteRef" href="saum-teaching.html#d44723e903">[12]</a> When looking at e-lit as DH implementation, I believe that the most
                    revolutionary change (and the most natural and intrinsic change coming from our

                    a community as a framework for creating and exploring literature in a

                    that he or she can translate to the benefit of the rest of humanity—an outdated
                    romantic conceptualization of work, sitting at the core of most modern
                    conceptions of literature, yet still prevalent behind the structuring of most of

                    importance to the practice of learning competencies (versus content-knowledge or
                    capacity). Teaching competencies in a community setting favors collective
                    learning, valuing prior knowledge (gained outside the learning community or in a
                    different one), while it considers the complexity of these activities within
                    their social evaluation and their context in a shared manner. Returning to
                    Díaz-Corralejo and Brouté, applying competency-based pedagogy to the teaching of
                    literature would imply taking on the collective perspective of socio cultural

                    This perspective would not be the typical practice of literary scholars or
                    academics, but, as I would like to suggest, it is the best approach when dealing
                    with the concepts at hand, because building a community of readers and writers

                    structured around the paradigms of the gift economy. In “Communitizing Electronic Literature” he explains how, when the World
                    Wide Web was being adopted at a popular level, “the community of electronic writers writ large made a
                            consequential choice”

                    more global in a geographical sense, and across different languages. Publishing
                    online, nevertheless, implies a demonetization of the product, while it assumes
                        <em class="emph">another</em> type of value based on sharing, and on the

                    humanities departments, make our teaching experience happen mostly in a

                    the practice of electronic literature involves expanding what we understand by
                    digital literacy. Following Dene Grigar, who builds on Cynthia Selfe’s <cite class="title italic">Technology and Literacy in the Twenty-First Century</cite>, I
                    propose that technical literacy today should not be seen simply as “a complex set of socially and culturally situated
                            values, practices, and skills involved in operating linguistically
                            within the context of electronic environments, including reading,
                            writing, and communicating”

                    the mastery of visual, sonic, kinetic, and kinesthetic modalities, allowing us
                    to situate contemporary knowledges within “a more adequate, richer, better account of the
                            world”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#selfe1999">Selfe 1999</a>][<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#grigar2008">Grigar 2008</a>]; a world that reflects upon the multilingual
                    nature of its global multiplicity. Such an approach would mean “that art forms that include a literary component could
                            be used to promote literacy”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#grigar2008">Grigar 2008</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Teaching e-lit, accordingly, should help us in the learning of technical
                    literacy, as Grigar suggests. And this is an important statement given that,
                    regardless of the disciplinary focus, there seems to be generalized consensus on
                    the importance of developing <em class="emph">some sort</em> of technical literacy as
                    part of the contemporary undergraduate curriculum. Going a step further, I
                    propose that, when dealing with e-lit, tinkering with the technical aspects that
                    are involved in the creation of digital works (a hands-on approach that I’ve
                    reiterated to be essential in order to fully comprehend the poetics and
                    narrativity of digital artworks) can teach us valuable lessons about what it
                    means for <em class="emph">any</em> work to have literary value—or, better yet, to
                        <em class="emph">be literary</em>—in our twenty-first century digital circumstance.
                    In other words, by understanding that e-lit is a type of literature that
                    incorporates a <em class="term">literary aspect</em> that emerges from a work’s
                    exploitation of its digitality, and that this aspect, correspondingly, can help
                    us gain important insights about the overall comprehension of the ontology of
                    the literary (beyond technical literacy and competencies), it is not difficult
                    to see why redefining this <em class="term">literary aspect</em>–or <em class="term">literary
                        elements</em>–of today’s digital objects should become paramount.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">The <em class="term">literary</em> however, is a slippery term that evaporates the minute
                    one tries to analyze it. In “The Idiocy of the Literary (and
                        what does it have to do with digital humanities?)” Sandy Baldwin has
                    acutely noticed: “[l]iterary criticism says nothing about the category of
                            the literary. It describes literary works and makes distinctions between
                            them because they are literary. A novel or poem may be good or bad, but
                            it is a subject of criticism because it is literary”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. Baldwin carries on explaining how literary scholars know about the
                    extent and complexity of critical classifications and theories applied to
                    literature, and acknowledges that knowing these is what makes us good literary
                    critics, “but it does not equip us to consider the
                            literary”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. The self-evidence of literature, as he puts it, “the given-ness that there are works of literature—makes
                            literary criticism the worst way to consider the literary”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Baldwin’s controversial statement is a very productive way to start thinking the
                    relationship between reading and writing competencies (to their pedagogical
                    extent) in the digital realm. His approach also helps us think through the
                        <em class="term">literary question</em> beyond electronic literature, or, going even
                    further, to use e-lit to rethink and evaluate the digital humanities as the
                    larger field from which I am proposing we study it. Questioning the problem of
                    the literary (together with those other more obvious terms that have been
                    consistently challenged over the past few decades such as
                        “author” or our notion of “reader” or
                    even “work”) may help us advance humanistic and literary
                    theories from the lens of the digital, whether the literature itself is digital
                    or not. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">In the same essay about the relationship between digital humanities and
                    electronic literature, Baldwin proposes that one of the essential
                        aspects—<em class="emph">the</em> essential aspect—of digital humanities is precisely
                    the question of the literary, “literally of the letter on the screen”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. By this, Baldwin underlines a chiasm that separates matter and
                    conceptuality or, appearance and abstraction. “In this chiasm, the digital letter is both literal and
                            figurative. It is, in short, literary. Not only this, but the letter is
                            poetic. It produces the system that will enable digital
                            humanities”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. In Baldwin’s essay, the resulting conditions for (Uni)code, “for storage, for processing, and so on, are produced
                            poetically from the literary, that is, from the letter as the given-ness
                            of a category, as an announcement that extends itself and exhausts
                            itself in doing so”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. He bases his analysis on the practice of TEI encoding to elaborate how
                    digital humanities as a field of enquiry has been systematized around a set of
                    categories for objects and discourses that work around literature without the
                    literary. According to this, the literary would come to mean “a domain of excess and difference that is
                            institutionalized as creativity or innovation”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. At the very least, Baldwin believes DH to be “uncomfortable with this sense of the literary”

                <div class="counter"><a href="saum-teaching.html#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Like Baldwin I believe that most of the current DH practices handle and present
                    the literary domain, but do not participate in it. Tools for analysis,
                    terminological databases, mapping and visualizations, etc., assume the
                    productivity of poetics of the literary, but are not literary. In Baldwin’s
                    words, digital humanities “follows the trajectory of the literary but is not
                            literary itself. It insists that it is methodological. Such insistence
                            lets digital humanities operate on and make a project out of the
                            literary”
                         [<a class="ref" href="saum-teaching.html#baldwin2013">Baldwin 2013</a>]. When it comes to literature and DH, then, we face a literature
                        <em class="emph">emptied</em> of the literary in contemporary research projects about
                    literature. Literature could be <em class="term">the object</em> of digital humanities,

                    proposes to rethink both the digital <em class="emph">and</em> the humanities at large.
                    Agreeing with him, and while recognizing the valuable insights gained by turning
                    literature into narratable data (as would happen with Unicode), I suggest we
                    also start working on <em class="emph">experiencing the literary</em> in itself.
                    Evidently, what I am suggesting implies rethinking our ways of experimenting
                    with digital tools, language, and literature <em class="emph">in a literary</em> way. And
                    this brings me back to the question of how to teach digital humanities

                    to the creation of digital prose and poetry is the best way to experience the
                    very slippery concept of the (digital) literary. By developing critical and
                    maker competencies in this manner, the literary stops being something abstract,

                    sits at the center is essential for the coherent evolution of literary studies
                    in the twenty-first century, from a research perspective to a curricular
                    development need. Moreover, and considering the global nature of the digital
                    writing field, this type of literary studies should push for an international
                    and multilingual nature that reflects the true linguistic diversity of our
                    campuses—highlighting Spanish in the case of my own Californian institution, but
                    not exclusively. I’m not talking about an absorption of Spanish e-lit into the
                    study of a new global digital language, but about the leveling of Spanish as a
                    foreign language with the global digital language that is electronic
                    literature—that may not be as foreign to us nowadays after all. Finally, opening
                    a space for writers, readers, students and teachers to learn together the
                    necessary competencies to explore the literary in its new digital circumstance
                    can illuminate important aspects of DH as a field of inquiry and teaching.
                    Rather than take the digital to make a project of the literary, what I am
                    stressing is that <em class="term">the digital</em> and <em class="term">the literary</em> are to
                    be experienced throughout, one coming out of the other and vice versa. I believe
                    this could broaden our current DH practices and scholarship, and, most
                    importantly, help us firm up the value and nature of the Humanities in the

                            “Key Eras of Growth for Competency-Based Learning”:
                        The 1970s, when “Institutions like Alverno College, DePaul University’s
                            School for New Learning, Regents College (now Excelsior College), the
                            State University of New York’s Empire State College, and Thomas Edison
                            State College are the first adopters. They seek to make higher education
                            available to a growing population of adult students by using
                            demonstrable outcomes and measures of previously acquired learning to
                            assess what students know. The approach allows students to make progress
                            at their own pace instead of following the traditional academic
                            calendar”; The late 1990s, when “the governors of 11 states agree,
                            in 1997, to create a virtual college to help students acquire training
                            for in-demand jobs like information technology, teaching, and nursing.
                            Western Governors University reaches 71 students in 1999, its first year
                            in operation. By 2015, it enrolls more than 62,000 students. Its scale
                            is enabled by online tools, a competency-based method, and the
                            separation of faculty roles into those who assess learning and those who
                            provide academic coaching”; And today, when “Southern New Hampshire
                            University, in 2013, becomes the first institution approved to award
                            federal financial aid based on students’ demonstrated progress instead
                            of the credit hour. That same year, the University of Wisconsin begins
                            offering its own competency-based program, signaling mainstream
                            acceptance of the idea. A year later, the Competency-Based Education
                            Network forms. The coalition of 17 institutions and two state systems
                            seeks to share information on this method of learning, guide its
                            development, and stake out principles for high-quality programs. Now
                            nearly 600 institutions are now seriously exploring competency-based
                            education”
