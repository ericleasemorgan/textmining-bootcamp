computer interaction In the most sophisticated cases the interaction modality is meant to be based on language There is a wide perception that the future of <ORGANIZATION>HCI</ORGANIZATION> is in themes such as entertainment emotions aesthetic pleasure motivation attention engagement etc Studying the relationship between natural language and affective information and dealing with their computational treatment is becoming crucial Initial user studies show that computers affective ability plays a vital role in improving interaction with users This ability depends not only on the affective expressiveness but also on the capacity to detect the affective state of the user Researchers have tried detecting the user s affective state in many ways such as through facial expressions speech physiology and text In particular text is an important modality for sensing affect because the bulk of computer user interfaces today are textually based Examples of such applications are synthetic agents for giving affective responses to the user input at the sentence level e g an affective text analyzer architecture <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> et Corresponding Author <PERSON>Alessandro

62 al 2003 and affective text to speech systems In other applications the affective interaction is finalized to influence the emotional state of the user We have worked in this direction in particular addressing some aspects of computational humour For instance we have exploited <ORGANIZATION>NLP</ORGANIZATION> to build systems that were capable of inducing amusement and affecting the emotional state of users e g HAHAcronym Stock and Strapparava 2003 For these applications it is necessary to have linguistic resources containing affective knowledge which unfortunately cannot be found off the shelf In order to develop a linguistic resource of this type it is necessary first to consider the lexical components of the affective language In this paper we describe our efforts in this direction We developed a preliminary version of a lexical knowledge base containing words in an affective lexicon connected with a set of affective concepts This resource named WORDNET AFFECT was developed starting from the lexical knowledge base WORDNET through a selection and labeling of the affective concepts represented by sets of synonyms WORDNET AFFECT was then extended taking into account OpenMind a database of common sense sentences in which there is a considerable amount of common sense knowledge Singh et al 2002 Exploiting WORDNET AFFECT and a word sense disambiguation algorithm <PERSON>Magnini</PERSON> et al 2002 we automatically chose an affective oriented subset of OpenMind named OpenMind Affect OpenMind Affect is composed of sentences patterns and parsing trees containing affective concepts In this way the affective lexicon is enriched by contextual words which do not directly refer to affective state emotions and mood but that are meaningful from the affect point of view 2 Applicative relevance of affective lexicon 2 1 Affective verbal language and HCI As claimed by <PERSON>Picard</PERSON> 1997 there are contexts in which human computer interaction can be improved with communication that involves the use of emotional information Affective communication can be performed with facial expressions physiological and behavioral responses to the affective states and natural language We are particularly interested in the verbal component of the affective communication for different reasons Regarding the applications in affect recognition the nonverbal channel is insufficient for expressing the full range of human emotional experiences According to <PERSON>Fussell</PERSON> nonverbal cues can indicate what general class of emotions a person is feeling but A Valitutti et al 63 they typically do not provide detailed information about that person s emotional state By seeing that someone is crying for instance we might assume that they are sad by the extent of sobbing we might even be able to infer the intensity of the sadness But the tears in and of themselves provide no information about the particular experience of sadness Instead verbal descriptions of emotional states can provide quite precise information about the specific form of an emotion such as anger depression or happiness that a person is experiencing Fussell 2003 The richness of natural language makes it possible to express emotions in different modalities and allows us to distinguish explicit communication as in introspective reports from unintentional communication e g when the form or the lexical content of the expression reveals an appreciative or depreciative disposition of the speaker These characteristics of affective verbal language allow us to develop systems for the detection and modelling of user affective states The affective user modelling can be used to realize an emotional intelligence consisting of the ability to recognize and appropriately respond to human emotions Picard 2000 For these applications the behaviour of the system is not describable only in terms of affect recognition or expression but consists of a complex adaptive interaction with the user In several applicative contexts the verbal output of the system depends not only on the actual affective state of the user but especially on the desired one For example in computational humour and computational persuasion <PERSON>Guerini Stock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zancanaro</PERSON> 2003 the system tries to put the user in the desired mental state which in the case of computational humour is amusement In this case the affective verbal language is actively used by the program instead of by the user In all <ORGANIZATION>HCI</ORGANIZATION> applications in which it is necessary to have an affective interaction it is very useful to have an affective lexical resource On this subject let us consider some existing applicative research and systems 2 2 Example applications <PERSON>Elliot</PERSON> s affective reasoner This is a collection of Artificial Intelligence programs that reason about human emotion and are embodied in multimedia computer agents It was conceived and developed by <PERSON>Clark Elliot</PERSON> 1992 but it is originally based on the theoretical work of Andrew Ortony et al 1988 The model on which the system was developed consists of a collection of 26 emotion categories related to eliciting conditions events objects and persons actions through a set of rules The conditions determine the choice of the emotion and a corresponding emotional response e g a Developing Affective Lexical Resources 64 convenient facial expression for an embodied agent or a verbal utterance for a conversational agent For the latter availability of organized lexical resource allows us to enhance the verbal expressivity Information and tutoring tools These systems use natural language generation to provide information on a particular subject or to instruct how to perform some complex action There are domains in which it is useful to produce messages that are empathetic to the hearer In this case the form of the messages is as important as the content For example when the message content produces an emotional effect on the subject the form may offset the unpleasant information and stressing the favourable one through mitigating or enhancing terms such as detensifier and intensifier adverbs <PERSON>De Rosis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Grasso</PERSON> 1999 For this purpose an affective lexical resource can provide a wide spectrum of lexical variants of the same concept with different affective weights Affective text sensing systems These are programs for assessing the affective qualities of natural language They can be very useful for <ORGANIZATION>HCI</ORGANIZATION> systems performing text based affective user modeling A new interesting approach corpus based is that of <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> et al 2003 The affect of the text at the sentence level is classified into one of six basic categories of emotion The analysis is performed through a model built starting from OpenMind Commonsense a large scale collection of common sense knowledge <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> et al chose a list of emotion words named ground words by which to bound a first set of affective sentences in OpenMind These sentences contain other words on which the affective information of the ground words is propagated with an attenuation factor By these new words a new set of affective sentences in OpenMind is individuated and so on This approach can be improved by increasing the number of ground words and by considering the senses of the words Then a lexical resource including the relation between affective words and concepts is required Computational humour There are some situations where humour can play an important role in improving human computer interaction e g edutainment or frustration reduction These are very difficult tasks but there are some recent positive results in this direction Stock and Strapparava 2003 have worked at a concrete limited problem for the core of the European Project HAHAcronym The main goal of HAHAcronym has been the realization of an acronym ironic re analyzer and generator The re analyzer A Valitutti et al 65 takes as input an acronym with its expansion and gives as output the same acronym with a humorous expansion Making fun of existing acronyms amounts to basically using irony on them desecrating them with some unexpected contrasting but otherwise consistent sounding expansion In this system ironic reasoning is developed mainly at the level of acronym choice and in the incongruity resulting in the relation to the coherently combined words of the acronym expansion The acronym generator is more complex than the re analyzer In this case the input is a concept from which the system generates both the acronym and the expansion The availability of an affective lexical resource can improve this strategy by allowing the system to focalize the incongruity at the affective level For re analyzing a positive or a negative valence value is attributed to the acronym and then the expansion generation must include affective words e g appreciative and depreciative words with opposite valence For acronym generation the valence opposition should be applied to both the input concept and the acronym 3 The model for the organization of the affective lexicon In order to organize the affective lexicon it is necessary to have a model for the affective knowledge representing emotions moods attitudes and traits Using this model we should be able to identify a large number of affective concepts organize them in a hierarchical structure and connect them via the lexicon The past literature on affective lexicons guided us in the search of the more suitable model 3 1 Limitations of the lexical semantics approach First attempts to build a lexical structure for affective terms concerned studying which terms are really representing emotions and what classification criteria to consider In particular lexical semantics approach was founded on the belief that it is possible to infer emotion properties from the emotion words D <PERSON>Urso</PERSON> and Trentin 1998 This approach consists of three main steps First emotion words are collected from dictionaries Weigand 1998 or from literary and newspaper texts Then a fixed number of semantic contexts are fixed e g pure emotion terms personality trait terms physical and cognitive state terms etc Ortony et al 1987 Finally from each term a set of affective dimensions is extracted using techniques such as factorial analysis Nowlis and Nowlis 1956 or multidimensional scaling Young et Hamer 1987 The lexical semantics approach showed a number of important issues <ORGANIZATION>Ortony</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Clore</PERSON> 1981 reviewed the literature on emotion labels and they suggested that the Developing Affective Lexical Resources 66 process used to select emotion words has not led to a domain of emotion words exclusively e g word anger refers to an emotion animosity to a mood and confusion to a cognitive state Another problem was outlined by <PERSON>Watson</PERSON> and Tellegen 1985 in the literature there is agreement only on some features such as arousal excited tense versus relaxed sleepy and valence happy glad versus sad upset However these two dimensions are not sufficient to individuate the whole spectrum of emotional concepts Moreover the techniques of the lexical semantics approach e g factorial analysis and multidimensional scaling don t allow us to distinguish different senses of the same word For example the word surprise may refer to a feeling the astonishment you feel when something totally unexpected happens to you to an event a sudden unexpected event or to an action the act of surprising someone In our approach to the affective lexicon the center of interest is not to study the nature of emotions but how the affective meanings are expressed in natural language Therefore in order to build a structure for organizing the affective lexicon we cannot use only information coming from the lexicon itself but we need to get affective information from extra linguistic sources provided by recent scientific research on emotion We preferred to look for an existing lexical resource and to enrich it with addictional affective information by a semiautomatic tagging procedure 3 2 The adoption of WORDNET as a model for the affective concepts The sought after model must exhibit an explicit representation of the concepts wide lexical coverage and a simple correlation between concepts and words We think that the lexical knowledge base WORDNET would be the best candidate for satisfying these requisites In the following section we provide an overview on WORDNET and on its structural organization 4 WORDNET and WORDNET DOMAINS As far as the representation and organization of lexical information is concerned a key concept is the idea of a Lexical Knowledge Base LKB proposed among others by <PERSON>Briscoe</PERSON> 1991 and <PERSON>Calzolari</PERSON> 1992 to provide information mostly of a semantic nature consistently structured and available electronically A Lexical Knowledge Base is an evolution both from a Machine Readable Dictionary in which one finds an electronic version of the paper dictionary and from a <ORGANIZATION>Lexical Data Base</ORGANIZATION> in which part of the information available in the text format dictionary has been extracted A Valitutti et al 67 One of the most significant attempts to realize a large scale LKB is WORDNET1 a thesaurus for the English language based on psycholinguistics principles and developed at the <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>George Miller Miller</PERSON> 1990 Fellbaum 1998 WORDNET organizes lexical information in terms of word meanings rather than word forms It has been conceived as a computational resource improving some of the drawbacks of traditional dictionaries such as the circularity of the definitions and the ambiguity of sense references English nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs about 130 000 lemmas for all the parts of speech in version 1 6 are organized into synonym classes synsets each representing one underlying lexical concept about 100 000 synsets Lemmas about 130 000 for version 1 6 are organized in synonyms classes about 100 000 synsets WORDNET can be described as a lexical matrix with two dimensions a dimension for lexical relations that is relations holding among words and thus language specific and a dimension for conceptual relations which hold among senses in WORDNET they are called synsets and that at least in part we consider independent from a particular language In Table 1 an example of a lexical matrix is reported Word form refers to the physical utterance or inscription word meaning refers to a lexicalized concept F1 and F2 are synonymous while F2 is polysemous Polysemy and synonymy are problems gaining access to information in the mental lexicon Word forms Word meaning F1 F2 F3 Fn M1 E11 E12 M2 E22 M3 E33 Mm Emn Table 1 WORDNET Lexical Matrix A synset contains all the words by means of which it is possible to express the synset meaning for example the Italian synset calcium calcio Ca describes the sense of calcio as a chemical substance while the synset calcio pedata describes the sense of calcio as a leg movement Here a list of some relations present in WORDNET follows 1 WORDNET is freely available for research purposes at http www cogsci princeton edu wn Developing Affective Lexical Resources 68 4 1 WordNet Relations Synonymy The most important lexical relation for WORDNET is the similarity of meaning since the ability to recognize synonymy among words is a prerequisite to build synsets and therefore meaning representation in the lexical matrix Two expressions are synonymous if substitutivity is valid in other words if the substitution of one with the other does not change the truth value of a phrase It is important to note that defining synonyms in terms of substitutivity requires partitioning WORDNET into nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs This is consistent with the psycholinguistic evidence that nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs are independently organized in the human semantic memory Obviously if a word pertains to more than one synset this gives an indication of its polysemy Antonymy This is another familiar relation among words It provides the organizing principle for adjectives The antonym of a word w in general is not w However there can be exceptions to this interpretation for instance while rich and poor are antonyms the statement that someone is not rich does not implies that he is poor Hyperonymy Hyponymy This corresponds to the well known ISA relation In a different way from synonymy and antonymy hyperonymy and its inverse hyponymy is a relation between meanings so it holds among synsets As an example the synset apple tree is a hyponymy of the synset tree which in turn is an hyponymy of plant This relation provides the organizing principle for the noun hierarchy Given a <ORGANIZATION>Hyperonymy Hyponymy</ORGANIZATION> hierarchy it is possible to calculate the coordinate terms for a given synset For example among the coordinate terms for horse there are the synsets mule and zebra which are common hyponyms of the synset equine equid Meronymy Holonymy This represents the relation between a whole and its parts It is a relation among synsets Three types of homonymyc relations along with their meronymyc inverse are used in WORDNET member of e g tree is member of forest part of of e g kitchen is part of apartment substance of of e g hydrogen is substance of water H 2 O Entailment This is a semantic relation used for defining the verb hierarchy From a logic point of view a proposition P entails a proposition Q if there is no state of the A Valitutti et al 69 world in which P is true and Q is false As an example the synset snore implies the synset sleep Troponymy The entailment relation is at the base of the definition of the troponymy relation which holds among verbs in fact synset S1 is troponym of synset S2 if S1 implies S2 and if S1 is temporally co extended with S2 e g the synset walk is a troponym of the synset move <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> irst has developed WORDNET DOMAINS a multilingual extension of the well known English WORDNET This is a general tool it is a multilingual lexical database where English and Italian senses are aligned This multilingual extension Artale et al 1997 <PERSON>Magnini</PERSON> and Strapparava 1997 is based on the assumption that a large part of the conceptual relations defined for the English about 72 000 ISA relations and 5 600 part of relations can be shared with Italian From an architectural point of view the Italian part of WORDNET DOMAINS implements an extension of the WORDNET lexical matrix to a multilingual lexical matrix through the addition of a third dimension relative to the language Some specific algorithms for use in computational humour have to be developed on top of WORDNET DOMAINS A fundamental tool is an incongruity detector generator concretely we need to be able to detect or propose semantic mismatches between word meanings in the acronym context This incongruity detector generator exploits the domain augmentation described in the following section Developing

in Lexicography i e Subject Field Codes to mark technical usages of words Although this is useful information for sense discrimination in dictionaries it is typically used for a small portion of the lexicon WORDNET DOMAINS2 is an attempt to extend the coverage of domain labels within an already existing lexical database WORDNET version 1 6 Synsets have been annotated with at least one domain

camber a slope in the turn of a road ARCHITECTURE 10 bank a flight maneuver TRANSPORT Table 2 WORDNET senses and domains for the word bank We have organized about 250 domain labels in a hierarchy exploiting Dewey Decimal Classification where each level is made up of codes of the same degree of specificity for example the second level includes domain labels such as BOTANY LINGUISTICS HISTORY SPORT and RELIGION while at the third level we can find specialisation such as AMERICAN_HISTORY GRAMMAR PHONETICS and TENNIS Information brought by domains is complementary to what is already in WORDNET First of all a domain may include synsets of different syntactic categories for instance MEDICINE groups together senses from Nouns such as doctor 1 and hospital 1 and from Verbs such as operate 7 Second a domain may include senses from different WORDNET sub hierarchies i e deriving from different unique beginners or from different lexicographer files For example SPORT contains senses such as athlete 1 deriving from life_form 1 game_equipment 1 from physical_object 1 sport 1 from act 2 and playing_field 1 from location 1 Finally domains can have an important role in the design of Word Sense Disambiguation algorithms In fact they may group senses of the same word into homogeneous clusters with the side effect of reducing word polysemy in WORDNET Developing Affective Lexical Resources 72 Table 1 shows an example The word bank has ten different senses in WORDNET 1 6 three of them i e bank 1 bank 3 and bank 6 can be grouped under the ECONOMY domain while bank 2 and bank 7 both belong to GEOGRAPHY and GEOLOGY causing the reduction of the polysemy from 10 to 7 senses The <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> irst particular approach to <ORGANIZATION>Word Sense Disambiguation</ORGANIZATION> called Word Domain Disambiguation has shown good results at the Senseval 2 competition <PERSON>Magnini</PERSON> et al 2001 5 WORDNET AFFECT Our work on affective lexicon was focused on the realization of a resource that contains the set of affective concepts correlated to the affective words The availability of the WORDNET database was an important starting point The synset model is sufficiently simple to provide an intrinsic correlation between a concept and the correspondent words Moreover WORDNET covers the entire English lexicon and provides an extraordinary large amount of conceptual distinctions WORDNET is particularly useful from a computational point of view because it was developed for easy access and navigation through its hierarchies Starting from WORDNET we selected a subset of synsets named WORDNET AFFECT suitable to represent affective concepts We are actually aiming at exploiting the expressivity of the WORDNET model without having to introduce modifications in the original structure Therefore we added additional information to the affective synsets without defining new ones Similarly to the domain label we attach to synsets in WORDNET DOMAINS we assign to a number of WORDNET synsets one or more affective labels a labels that contribute to precise the affective meaning For example the affective concepts representing emotional state are individuated by synsets marked with the a label EMOTION The concepts that are not emotional affective e g those representing moods situations eliciting emotions or emotional responses are characterized by other a labels WORDNET AFFECT was developed in two stages The first consisted of the identification of the core synsets The second step consisted of the extension of the core with the relations defined in WORDNET 5 1 The development of the core of WORDNET AFFECT The first stage of the WORDNET AFFECT development consists of collecting an initial set of affective words To this aim a preliminary resource named Affect was manually realized A Valitutti et al 73 Affect is a lexical database containing 1 903 terms directly or indirectly referring to mental e g emotional states The main part of Affect consists of nouns 539 and adjectives 517 There is a smaller number of verbs 238 and a tiny set of adverbs 15 In order to collect this material we started from an initial set of psychological adjectives in particular affective adjectives The collection was extended with the help of dictionaries In a second step nouns were added through an intuitive correlation with the adjectives In a similar way verbs and adverbs were added For each item a frame was created in order to add lexical and affective information Lexical information includes the correlation between English and Italian terms parts of speech pos definitions synonyms and antonyms The attribute POSR relates terms having different pos but pointing to the same psychological category For example the adjective cheerful is semantically linked to the name cheerfulness to the verb cheer up and to the adverb cheerfully Affective information is a reference to one or more of the three main kinds of theories on emotion representation discrete theories based on the concept of cognitive evaluation basic emotion theories and dimensional theories Ac cording to the work of Ortony et al 1987 terms are classified in emotional terms non emotional affective terms e g mood and non affective mental state terms Other terms are linked with personality traits behaviors mental attitudes physical or bodily states and feelings such as pleasure or pain Some examples terms and their category are given in Table 3 Category Example Term Emotion anger Cognitive state doubt Personality competitive Behaviour cry Mental attitude skepticism Feeling pleasure Table 3 Categories and terms Discrete emotional information is characterized by an attribute whose value corresponds to one of the 24 emotional categories described by Elliot 1992 Another attribute allows us to indicate one of the six basic emotions cited by <PERSON>Ekman</PERSON> 1992 Dimensional emotional information needs two attributes denoting valence that is how Developing Affective Lexical Resources 74 positive or negative a fixed emotional state is and arousal that is the level of emotional excitation Part of the information was collected from dictionaries and from scientific documentation on the psychology of emotions the remaining information was inserted on an intuitive and arbitrary basis The former kind of data was associated with references to the sources the latter is the rough material for a subsequently critical review for example by psychologists or lexicographers As an example here is one of the frames

labels projections By mapping the senses of terms in Affect to their respective synsets the affective core was identified Then we projected part of the affective information in the Affect database onto the corresponding senses of WORDNET AFFECT as value of an affective mark named a label in the appendix the complete list of a labels is reported The information projected was that of the Affect slot ortony used to discriminate between different types of affective concepts This operation was not complete over all synsets of WORDNET AFFECT both because the value of the ortony slot was null for some of A Valitutti et al 75 the Affect items and because there are synsets manually added besides those individuated in Affect For this reason we proceeded to a further manual labeling in order to assign the a label value to the whole set of affective synsets The opportunity to interface Affect with WORDNET allows us to outline different developments On one hand it is possible to extend the collection through a search of synonyms and antonyms performed on each of the terms of Affect that are contained in WORDNET On the other hand it is useful to compare the affective information of the database with WORDNET hyperonym hierarchy restricted to the Psychology domain <PERSON>Magnini</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cavaglia</PERSON> 2000 in order to propose enrichment in the structure of this semantic field Our analysis of WORDNET synsets that contain Affect words suggested that synsets could be used to represent affective concepts At the level of single affective concepts the characterization as synsets is quite accurate though additional WORDNET relations such as those resulting in the ISA hierarchy are not always appropriate We have given the name WORDNET AFFECT to the subset of WORDNET that includes 1 314 synsets representing the senses of the entries in Affect Nouns Adjectives Verbs Adverbs Total Synsets 535 557 200 22 1314 Words 1336 1472 592 40 3340 Table 4 Number of affective synsets and words grouped by part of speech in WORDNET AFFECT 5 3 Exploiting the WORDNET hierarchies As explained in section 4 in WORDNET a fixed number of lexical i e between words and semantic i e between synsets relations are defined Once we individuated the affective core we studied if and at what extent exploiting the WORDNET relations the affective core of WORDNET AFFECT could be extended For each relation we examined if it preserves the affective meaning i e if that relation applied to the synset of WORDNET AFFECT generates synsets that yet represent affective concepts If the resulting synsets are members of WORDNET AFFECT the answer is trivially affirmative But in the case in which the relation generates synsets not included in the database it should be necessary to proceed to manual checking However an exploratory examination allowed us to individuate a list of reliable relations antonymy similarity derived from pertains to attribute also see for which we assumed that the affective meaning is preserved for all items of Developing Affective Lexical Resources 76 WORDNET AFFECT Therefore all synsets obtained by an application of those relations and not yet contained in WORDNET AFFECT are de facto included in it For other relations such as hyperonymy entailment causes verb group we assumed that the affective meaning is only partially preserved In that case it is necessary to manually filter the synsets in order to select those genuinely affective Nouns Adjectives Verbs Adverbs Total similar to 0 668 0 0 668 antonym 64 106 23 6 199

Table 5 Number of new affective synsets obtained applying WORDNET relations to the synsets of WORDNET AFFECT 6 OpenMind Affect Once a fixed set of affective concepts has been identified represented by the synsets of WORDNET AFFECT it seems useful to distinguish those directly referring to affective states from those denoting for example their causes and consequences For that it is very important to have a wide resource of common sense expressions This resource can be exploited as stereotypical knowledge which allows us to extract relevant information e g events that typically causes specific emotions With reference to the work of <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> et al 2003 we have used OpenMind as a source of stereotypical knowledge OpenMind is a wide common sense knowledge base containing sentences linguistic patterns and parse trees Unlike <PERSON>Liu</PERSON> et al 2003 sentences of OpenMind were annotated through a word sense disambiguation tool developed at <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> irst <PERSON>Magnini</PERSON> et al 2002 in order to associate each word with the corresponding WORDNET sense In this way it was possible to identify the sentences containing words with an affective meaning and to select an affectively significant subset of OpenMind which we have called OpenMind AFFECT Using only words in Affect we selected a set of 74 455 sentences in OpenMind Using the words in WORDNET AFFECT we increased the size of this set to 171 657 sentences This resource is employed as an environment for A Valitutti et al 77 experimentation about an affective lexicon In particular we aim at obtaining the following results 1 increasing the collection of affective concepts To this aim we need to identify in the sentences of OpenMind Affect new words related to well known ones in order to obtain new synsets to include in WORDNET AFFECT 2 collecting contextual information such as events that typically cause specific emotions 3 using contextual information in order to increase the affective knowledge of the lexical items whenever possible In order to extract the contextual knowledge it is necessary to exploit some linguistic patterns to connect words denoting affective states with contextual words For example the pattern X causes Y where X denotes an event and Y refers to an emotional state allows us to identify a typical cause of that emotion The lexical semantics of emotional adjectives Goy 2000 allows us to deduce some of these structures even if they are not explicitly present in the sentence For example the adjective cheerful in general may have different ways for denoting the emotional state stative manifestative causative Nevertheless if it is included in the noun phrase cheerful flower it assumes the causative reading and implicitly expresses the fact that the flower causes cheerfulness which allows us to add a potentially new contextual concept to the set of the affective concepts 7 Future work At this stage of the work we put our efforts towards the collection of an initial set of affective concepts We performed manual tagging in order to have a core then we employed some WORDNET relations in order to extend the core and to propagate the labelling Our next task consists of the definition of an appropriate procedure for the a label annotation of the synsets We are thinking of evaluating that annotation scheme with a test of reliability and performing an evaluation of the a label values with an intertagging agreement procedure with multiple judges We aim to extend the number of affective synsets not only with WORDNET relations but also with machine learning techniques applied to large linguistic corpora Finally we want to test WORDNET AFFECT through an evaluation of the applicative tools in which that resource will be used For example considering the affective text sensing Developing Affective Lexical Resources 78 tools WORDNET AFFECT allows such systems to perform reasoning not only on the word level but on the sense level through the synsets linked to each word in the resource In this manner we think we can obtain an improvement in the performance of the affective understanding from texts The a label distinction between emotion mood and trait allows user modeling systems to perform more complex distinctions and so improve the richness of the user model itself We are thus working in the development of a number of prototypes with which we want to test the applicative potentiality of WORDNET AFFECT 8 Conclusions WORDNET AFFECT is potentially of wider use as it allows for some reasoning capability and as we pointed out is also connected to relevant common sense knowledge in textual format An affective lexicon is per se an important resource for many applications both based on language recognition and on language production The potential applications in natural language processing are the basis for those in human computer interaction In particular language recognition is employed in user modeling and language production is necessary for the verbal communication of emotions In dealing with texts automatically emotion related contents can be retrieved or summarized or seriously classified only if we start from some level of lexical reasoning If a system is able to perform some reasoning starting from emotion inducing lexical entries it may be substantially more sophisticated In our case it may do so just because of the fact that the common sense thesaurus is linked to synonym sets For instance we may have knowledge stating that people are afraid of earthquakes At least some of the simplest statements in the common sense base can have been parsed and yielded semantic relations that involve affect So whenever earthquakes are a topic the system could also know they produce fear and therefore classify or summarize the text with this additional dimension Along the same view all tasks that involve disambiguation can substantially exploit the resource The multilingual framework of WORDNET DOMAINS developed at IRST also accommodates WORDNET AFFECT and this is an important resource for automatic translation and can yield appropriate ways to overcome language gaps systematically On the basis of the lexical information a system can understand explicitly stated information about the emotional state of the user or of someone else and so the system can use emotion expressions appropriately A Valitutti et al 79 One class of potential applications concerns some even limited form of reasoning in a dialog system For instance a system may be able to advise a user interested in choosing a movie taking into account the fact that he said he does not want to see a scary movie In general the system may want to understand statements regarding the affective state of the user a simple case is automatic analysis of a questionnaire Whatever the indicators are there are experiments with physiologically based feedback a system may adapt its expressions to the user If we consider system output there are many aspects with potential for application of the affect lexical base Multimodal interfaces are a privileged case for instance a life like character may appear as the agent delivering the message and the system may coordinate appropriate facial expression when emotional expressions are uttered similarly the synthetic voice may reflect the emotional valence of a specific fragment of the message Another case that can be interesting concerns Kinetic Types where types move producing an emotional effect normally in agreement with the contents Still other possibilities concern the use of persuasive expressions A system may have to make reference to emotional concepts in order to persuade the audience to perform an action see <PERSON>Guerini Stock</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zancanaro</PERSON> 2003 We see similar potential for games in the future an essential motivating context for learning environments Emotional concepts are at the basis of many games and if the interaction between player and system is going to become more natural and complex they are likely to be expressed linguistically In a system that helps group activity or in other cases of human human interaction it may be important that the system provides different messages to different participants with appropriately different emotional expressions even if conveying the same semantic contents Finally we are particularly interested in automatic humour production Computational humour can have an important role in future interfaces Humour plays on the beliefs and expectations of the hearer By infringing on them it causes surprise and then hilarity <PERSON>Humour</PERSON> also encourages creativity The change of perspective caused by humorous situations induces new ways of interpreting the same event A typical use of humour can be found in advertisement We aim at building semiautomatic and later on fully automatic systems for helping obtaining novel verbal humour expressions for instance in advertising applications For that purpose we intend to use WORDNET AFFECT with its connected common sense emotional expressions in a manner that is creative and disrupts conventions Developing Affective Lexical Resources 80 9 Acknowledgments This work was realized as part of the TICCA project funded by the Autonomus Province of

10 Appendix A complete list of a labels used in WORDNET AFFECT A Label Examples EMOTION noun anger 1 verb fear 1 MOOD noun animosity 1 adjective amiable 1 TRAIT noun aggressiveness 1 adjective competitive 1 COGNITIVE STATE noun confusion 2 adjective dazed 2 PHYSICAL STATE noun illness 1 adjective all_in 1 <ORGANIZATION>EDONIC</ORGANIZATION> SIGNAL noun hurt 3 noun suffering 4 EMOTION ELICITING SITUATION noun awkwardness 3 adjective out_of_danger 1 EMOTIONAL RESPONSE noun cold_sweat 1 verb tremble 2 BEHAVIOUR noun offense 1 adjective inhibited 1 ATTITUDE noun intolerance 1 noun defensive 1 SENSATION noun coldness 1 verb feel 3 Table 6 The a labels EMOTION synsets are the only pure emotional synset they refer directly to emotional states processes From theories of emotions we have that moods have to be distinguished from emotions Therefore MOOD synsets are affective but not emotional If personality traits influence attitude to have affective reactions to events then the TRAIT synsets have an indirect reference to the affective states Affective states are often confused with cognitive ones because they have a mutual strict relation COGNITIVE STATE synsets represent cognitive states that are often related to affect but form a distinct category Similar considerations have to be made for PHYSICAL STATE synsets Edonic signals pleasure and pain are a necessary component of the affective state but they are not emotions themselves We introduced the a label EDONIC SIGNAL in order to cope with these concepts A Valitutti et al 81 Emotional states have causes and consequences The causes are named ELICITING EMOTION SITUATIONS and may be events behaviors etc e g a dangerous situation may cause fear The consequences of emotions are named emotional responses and may consist of behaviors somatic changes facial expressions etc The EMOTIONAL RESPONSE synsets represent that set of responses BEHAVIOUR synsets represent behaviors that are either the cause or effect of affective states ATTITUDE synsets refer to attitudes which are complex mental states involving beliefs feelings values and dispositions to act in certain ways A sensation is an unelaborated elementary awareness of stimulation SENSATION synsets represent those kinds of concepts 11 References Artale et al 1997 Artale A Magnini B Strapparava C 1997 WordNet for Italian and Its Use for
