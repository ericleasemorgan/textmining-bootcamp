<ner>Open Access Publishing Models and How OA Can Work in the Humanities by <PERSON>Martin Paul Eve T</PERSON> he opening words of the 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiativedeclaration were a n old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good 1 The old tradition was the university and its peculiar systems of remuneration wherein scholars produce work in order to be read rather than to earn a living through sales of that work The new technologies were the internet and the World Wide Web with their capacities for near unlimited dissemination once a first copy has been produced The fundamental public good of open access OA was to use these technologies and this social situation of the university to give anybody the right to read and re use academic research outputs without requiring payment from readers Yet some old traditions within the university have taken less well to the incursion of new technologies into their publishing spaces Although it is not universally true the humanities disciplines have overall been less engaged with the discussions around open access than their scientific counterparts they have been less enthusiastic about the open dissemination of their work online for free than other disciplinary areas and they have presented research objects that demonstrate considerable economic difficulties for a transition to an open model such as research monographs Before turning to the ways in which progress with open access in the humanities is steadily advancing it is worth covering these challenges in a little more detail On the first point many humanists were caught by surprise at national and funder level mandates for open access Despite the conversation having begun in the early 2000s that is almost two decades ago the introduction of policies such as the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> s <ORGANIZATION>Higher Education Funding Council</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> HEFCE OA mandate for journal articles in 2014 seemed to wrong foot many humanities scholars 2 While large initiatives in the natural sciences have been ongoing for many years to reconfigure the Special Section

of disseminating research freely has not quite taken hold in the field of humanities Though humanities publishers could also benefit from an OA model many have been resistant citing possible issues with plagiarism or appropriation of an author s work for less than ideal uses There are also challenges with the cost of publishing OA content which for humanities could be much higher than in the scientific community due to the length of works produced Some institutions have taken to charging authors to publish their content in an OA model while others have opted for a membership structure or joining a consortium of other institutions such as Knowledge Unlatched or the <ORGANIZATION>Open Library of Humanities</ORGANIZATION> While many great strides have been taken to bring OA to humanities

Humanities publishing ecosystem to one that is openly accessible think of the <ORGANIZATION>Public Library of Science</ORGANIZATION> or the arXiv site the humanities have been far slower That said there were a limited number of humanistic voices present in the early discussions around open access <PERSON>Peter Suber</PERSON> a prominent voice in the OA community was a philosophy professor before taking up his post as director of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Scholarly Communication at Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Jean Claude Gu</PERSON> don a professor in the comparative literature department at <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> was also a signatory to the early declarations Even so humanists were hardly the majority of the parties discussing open access at that time When debate did finally emerge around open access in the humanities it was often in a negative context Indeed in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> where a great deal of recent political OA debate has centered there was caution and opposition urged from many sides <PERSON>John Holmwood</PERSON> for instance noted on several occasions how the open licensing of research work under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY provisions could lead to the appropriation of this work by new predatory for profit universities in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> who sought degree awarding powers without conducting any of their own teaching For <PERSON>Holmwood</PERSON> the danger was that such entities would package such work as a degree and the very open circulation of research material could then undermine the research university itself 3 Others were more strident <PERSON>Peter Mandler</PERSON> the former president of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Historical Society</ORGANIZATION> asserted that open access could encourage new plagiarism like practices while also posing problems for quality control 4 5 Finally some figures such as <PERSON>David Golumbia</PERSON> have linked open access to other market based neoliberal influences on the academy 6 In other words recent debate around OA in the humanities has been far from universally positive Finally due to the scientific interest in OA in the early days of discussion much of the work around business models and the economics of open access has focused on the journal article as the emblematic output However the humanities disciplines are not centered solely around journal articles They have a broad spectrum of research objects from performance based modes through to long form writing Since open access does not assume that publishing is free of cost even if we seek to make access free of charge to the reader there have been problems with devising and implementing business models for say research monographs A simple example can illustrate this problem As a publisher the most obvious business model for journal publishing if one cannot sell the outputs because one is making them available under the so called gold route of open access is to charge authors institutions and funders for the work that is conducted That is if one cannot sell a product to readers one sells a service to authors A typical price for this might be 2 000 3 000 USD per article What happens though when you scale the labor of publishing copyediting typesetting proofreading digital preservation platform maintenance legal accounting and so forth to cover artifacts that are 10 times longer than journal articles Well the costs predictably are much higher For instance a recent <ORGANIZATION>Mellon Ithaka</ORGANIZATION> study produced a range of between 15 140 and 129 909 per book 7 In the article processing charge <ORGANIZATION>APC</ORGANIZATION> world of the sciences a price per article of 2000 might work But it still concentrates costs Subscriptions do one thing extremely well they spread costs among many institutions An <ORGANIZATION>APC</ORGANIZATION> concentrates the entire cost on a single entity That is not to say that the situation is rosy in the humanities under a subscription model The humanities have been subject to the same 300 rise above inflation in journal subscription costs since 1986 as the sciences which has led to a substantial access gap even at the wealthiest universities However when speaking of publishing in the humanities the <ORGANIZATION>APC</ORGANIZATION> model is particularly difficult For consider a world where in the first place budgets are far harder to come by and the most important types of research output cost closer to 20 000 That world is the world of the humanities and open access Progress Nonetheless Despite the aforementioned challenges open access in the humanities continues to grow Sometimes this growth is due to work by subject bodies such as the <ORGANIZATION>Modern Language Association Indeed</ORGANIZATION> under the stewardship of <PERSON>Kathleen Fitzpatrick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nicky Agate</PERSON> this organization s new Humanities Commons platform encourages humanities researchers to share their work legally and openly under the green model Of course the <ORGANIZATION>MLA</ORGANIZATION> still derives E V E c o n t i n u e d

flagship journal to go open access members might begin to cancel their membership payments as well The <ORGANIZATION>Royal Historical Society</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> has also recently partnered with a digital press at the <ORGANIZATION>School of Advanced Study</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to produce an open access monograph series In this way we do see creeping progress from subject associations in the humanities Speaking more broadly there is also a range of funder and institution driven initiatives As of March 2017 the <ORGANIZATION>Association of American Universities AAU the Association of Research Libraries ARL</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Association of American University Presses AAUP</ORGANIZATION> are building an open access publishing scheme for monographs that is funded by institutional subvention As they put it in their press release The universities and colleges directly participating in this initiative will incorporate three components into their digital monograph publishing projects provide a baseline university publishing grant of 15 000 to support the publication of an open access digital monograph of 90 000 words or less with additional funding for works of greater length or complexity to be negotiated by the author institution and publisher set a target of awarding at least three publishing grants per year and commit to participating in this initiative for five years 8 Perhaps the strongest drivers of new open access monograph initiatives for the humanities have come from funders though The <ORGANIZATION>Andrew W Mellon Foundation</ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> has awarded a substantial number of grants over the past decade in order to understand and advance the open scholarship agenda in the humanities Likewise in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>HEFCE</ORGANIZATION> has signaled that it intends to apply an open access mandate for books to the Research Excellence Framework REF that it will hold in the mid 2020s giving approximately a decade to figure out how to achieve a switch Finally although strangely placed to be funding humanities scholarship the <ORGANIZATION>Wellcome Trust</ORGANIZATION> has also been a strong driver of open access books <ORGANIZATION>Wellcome</ORGANIZATION> funds medical humanities research such as the histories of medicine but also other interdisciplinary intersections with medicine and the humanities <ORGANIZATION>Wellcome</ORGANIZATION> is one of the few funders in the world to insist that all of its research outputs are entirely open access and will pay the book processing charges when needed for research that it funds Not all progress has been top down though Indeed there are a number of scholar led enterprises that strike me as being efficacious in moving the open agenda forward In the UK Open Book Publishers and <ORGANIZATION>Open Humanities Press</ORGANIZATION> have for many years published open access monographs I have myself published a peer reviewed open access book with the former Running on mixed business models that combine freemium OA with a print sales strategy these entities are relatively small in scale but become increasingly attractive since they do not demand an unaffordable charge from authors The same is true of <PERSON>Eileen Joy</PERSON> s Punctum Books a U S based publisher of often radical humanities research that has recently opened up a subscription like service to which individuals can contribute to help with the sustainability of the press It is also true that various open educational resource OER projects are making headway in the textbook and open syllabus arena The emergence of membership models for open access humanities book publishing evident in Punctum Books and Open Book Publishers points toward the challenges of economic distribution that I gestured toward above Indeed to fully understand this difficulty is to realize that the entirety of the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> s current yearly book purchasing budget in libraries across all types of book not just academic research monographs would barely stretch to cover the books published by just the four biggest academic presses in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> This problem of redistribution can be solved through membership models or through consortial pooling both of which achieve the same end The most well known initiative in the latter space is Knowledge Unlatched Founded by <PERSON>Frances Pinter</PERSON> who had previously launched an open access pilot at Bloomsbury Academic during her tenure there this project asks libraries around the world to band together to fund the unlatching of monographs That is for example if 300 libraries all pledge an amount say 80 each that will total the fee required by the publisher say 20 000 then the book can be made openly accessible Knowledge Unlatched which is not a publisher but a funder of publishers who submit their titles is by far the largest initiative so far in the humanities and social scientific open access space for monographs with 343 books E V E c o n t i n u e d Special Section NEX T PAGE

Such problems of scale and distribution though have also been seen in the humanities journal publishing arena The initiative that I co founded the <ORGANIZATION>Open Library of Humanities OLH</ORGANIZATION> based on the theoretical research work in my book Open Access and the Humanities Contexts Controversies and the Future published open access by <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University Press</ORGANIZATION> 9 takes this model of distributed subsidy and applies it to a journal publishing environment We currently have over 220 libraries around the world including <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Princeton Yale Carnegie Mellon Cambridge UCL</ORGANIZATION> all sites of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California System</ORGANIZATION> and many others paying a fee that looks like a subscription to the OLH The catch is that we make all of our research work openly accessible In our first year of operation we published 909 articles some front some back list across 18 journals With these libraries supporting this lowered the cost to just 1 10 per institution per article or at 118 686 readers just 0 008 per institution per reader We have also begun partnerships with university presses <ORGANIZATION>The University of Wales Press</ORGANIZATION> is converting one of its journals to use our model and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Liverpool Press</ORGANIZATION> has just followed with more announcements scheduled for later this year The model is also designed to offset against previous subscription costs as journals come on board to flip to open access thereby saving libraries funds in the long term Indeed then even if we have had resistance from humanities scholars there are an increasing number of initiatives finding routes to gold open access in the humanities while the uptake of green deposit also continues to skyrocket In the face of apparently insurmountable difficulties we have progress nonetheless What Are the Humanities For In this piece I ve looked at the ways in which the humanities have struggled with open access At the same time I have also demonstrated a range of projects that are bringing possibilities to the table for these subjects The new technologies might be able to help our old traditions after all if we can address the social challenges that surround changing publication practices in the humanities Despite concerns and the slow pace of change then it seems important to me that the humanities can benefit from open online dissemination of our research material The humanities are quite literally the study of human cultures and their artifacts These subjects do not cure cancers or invent new telescopes but they do tell us a great deal about who we are and where we have come from as people They help us to understand the phenomena that make us so different as a species from other animals that is our artworks and cultures and they help us to contextualize our political and social environments within broader timeframes of history To study ourselves as humans is the mission of the humanities subjects in all their diverse breadths I believe in open access for the humanities though because a fundamental question should move us what good is research on the human if our fellow humans cannot afford to read that work E V E c o n t i n u e d Special Section NEX T PAGE gt N EX T A RT I C L E gt lt TOP O F A RT I C L E lt
