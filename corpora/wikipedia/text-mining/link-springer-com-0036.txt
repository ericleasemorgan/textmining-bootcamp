Abstract
The Evolving tree (ETree) is a hierarchical clustering and visualization model that allows the number of clusters to grow and evolve with new data samples in an online learning manner. While many hierarchical clustering models are available in the literature, ETree stands out because of its visualization capability. It is an enhancement of the Self-Organizing Map, a famous and useful clustering and visualization model. ETree organises the trained data samples in the form of a tree structure for better presentation and visualization especially for high-dimensional data samples. Even though ETree has been used in a number of applications, its use in textual document clustering and visualization is limited. In this paper, ETree is modified and deployed as a useful model for undertaking textual documents clustering and visualization problems. We introduce a new local re-learning procedure that allows the tree structure to grow and adapt to new features, i.e., new words from new textual documents. The performance of the proposed ETree model is evaluated with two (one benchmark and one real) document data sets. A number of key aspects of the proposed ETree model, which include its topology representation, learning time, as well as recall and precision rates, are evaluated. The results show that the proposed local re-learning procedure is useful for handling increasing number of features incrementally. In summary, this study contributes towards a modified ETree model and its use in a new domain, i.e., textual document clustering and visualization.

 	 The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it voted to transfer one billion dlrs cash from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) to the Dallas Federal Home Loan bank tomorrow to correct a collateral deficiency. The infusion was needed because the value of collateral behind FSLIC loans to savings and loan associations in the region had declined, an FHLBB official said. The official said that as a result, auditors of the Dallas bank, one of the 12 regional federal home loan banks, would be able to give an unqualified opinion on the bank’s condition. Reuter&#3;

 	 The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) announced today the replacement of a closed Santa Ana, Calif., savings bank in the 15th federal action assisting troubled U.S. savings institutions this year. The FHLBB said Perpetual Savings Bank in Santa Ana was put into receivorship because it was insolvent and was replaced by a new federally chartered Perpetual Savings Association. It said the savings bank’s insolvency “was a direct result of losses on speculative investments in real estate which were not supported by appraisals.” The FHLBB said it appointed Great American First Savings Bank&lt;GTA> of San Diego to manage Perpetual Savings. It said as of January 31, Perpetual had assets of 61.9 mln dlrs. Reuter&#3;

 	 The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it had closed Equitable Savings and Loan Association of Fountain Valley, Calif., and transferred its insured deposits to Empire of America–California, FSB, a federal savings bank in Woodland Hills, Calif. Equitable had assets of 59.12 mln dlrs. Empire is a subsidiary of Empire of America, FSB, Buffalo, N.Y., which has 9.1 billion dlrs in assets and 143 offices in five states. The former offices of Equitable will open as branches of Empire and Equitable’s depositors will have immediate access to their insured funds. Equitable was insolvent and had substantially dissipated assets and earnings, resulting in an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the bank board said. It was the seventh closing of a thrift in the nation this year and the first liquidation in California. The FHLBB said Equitable had deposits of 79.2 mln dlrs, all of which was insured except for about 300,000 dlrs. A spokeswoman for the board said information on the cost of the transfer to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. was unavailable. Reuter&#3;

 	 Leaders of Italy’s five coalition parties have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi’s Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats. Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week, allowing negotiations on a new government leader. The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last August, under which he was to hand over the prime minister’s job next month, was unlikely to be fulfilled. Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister’s job. They said Craxi’s plans to resign show he has decided to stick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program and sharing of ministries will not be easy. They said there is dissent among the partners and that Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether formation of a new government is feasible or early elections are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988. REUTER&#3;

 	 Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi said his five party coalition government would resign. Craxi, Italy’s prime minister for a postwar record of 3–1/2 years, told the Senate (upper house) he would hand his and the government’s resignation to President Francesco Cossiga immediately after leaving the chamber. Craxi has been prime minister, at the head of two separate but identical five–party coalitions, since August 1983. Reuter&#3;

 	 President Francesco Cossiga meets political leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi’s Socialist Party has said it will not serve under Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister five times previously and whom the majority Christian Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again. The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing five–party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party’s president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister. Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading parties. In Craxi’s 3–1/2 years as prime minister, the Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being denied the prime minister’s job. The sources said early general elections are likely unless agreement can be reached. Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists and the junior coalition members —- Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats. After the consultations, Cossiga will name a prime minister–designate who will try to form a government. REUTER&#3;

 	 Italian Prime Minister designate Giulio Andreotti expressed cautious optimism about his chances of forming a government, amid concern by industrialists that a lengthy political crisis could cause economic damage. Andreotti today wound up his first round of political consultations aimed at finding a way out of the crisis. His Christian Democrats and the Socialists of outgoing premier Bettino Craxi, whose row caused last week’s collapse of the five–party coalition, remained deeply divided. Andreotti said he would spend the weekend considering the situation before a second round of consultations next week. Meanwhile Italy’s top industrialists expressed concern that a long drawn—out crisis, or continuing squabbling between the five coalition partners, could jeopardise the major economic progress made in three—and—a—half stable years under Craxi. Luigi Lucchini, president of the employers organisation Confindustria said in a speech yesterday, “What is certain is that a precarious political situation is damaging to the economy, to the objectives of companies, to competitivity.” His remarks were supported by Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli, who said in a radio interview that he hoped for a reconstruction of the coalition.

 	 Many real world engineering problems of interest revolve around a system that satisfied the monotonicity property between its input and output. thus, specific fuzzy model that preserves monotonicity constraints better approximates than the conventional fuzzy model. in the recent year, methods that improve the performance of fuzzy model that satisfy the monotonic constraints have been reported. in this paper, we investigate on the conditions for a single-input fuzzy model to fulfill the monotone output property using a derivative approach. from the derivation, a guideline on how the input membership functions should be tuned is provided. we demonstrate the use of the derived conditions with an application of fuzzy model to my proposed fuzzy occurrence model in failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) methodology. i construct the fuzzy occurrence model with information collected from a semiconductor manufacturing plant for flip chip ball grid array (fcbga) products. analysis and concluding remarks are then presented

 	 In the context awareness, information would be retrieved, processed, shared, and reused in the maximum automatic way possible. our study in the context awareness application has shown that these are rarely a matter of true or false but rather procedures that require degrees of relatedness, similarity, or ranking. apart from the wealth of applications that are inherently imprecise, information itself is many times imprecise or uncertain. for example, temperature is “cold” “warm” “hot” and tourist is “low” “medium” “high” are examples of such concepts. dealing with such type of information would yield more realistic, intelligent and effective applications. in this paper we propose a fuzzy owl web ontology language, in order to be able to capture, and represent with such type of uncertain concepts

 	 Qualitative technique; Semi-quantitative technique; Quantitative technique; Risk-based assessment; Risk analysis; Reliability method.
 	 Corrosion is a common form of degradation in pipelines that reduces both the static and cyclic strength of a pipeline. in the structural engineering field, metal corrosion is considered as one of the most dominant failure mechanisms that significantly affects the reliability of structure. this paper presents a methodology for the assessment of corrosion in pipelines known as risk-based assessment (rba). rba has been a topic of interest among structure owners and inspection vendors due to its great capability in ensuring pipeline safety and integrity as well as enhancing the cost effectiveness. rba is a systematic approach which aims to reduce the overall risk exposure by focusing on the areas of higher risk. this approach reduces the total scope of work and inspection costs in a structured and justifiable way. the paper reviews about three types of risk assessment techniques which are qualitative (q), semi-quantitative (sq) and quantitative risk assessment (qra). however, the paper mainly focused on qra which focusing on risk estimation (likelihood analysis and consequence analysis). this technique can be utilised to avoid unnecessary inspection and extend the inspection intervals based on the risks associated with the pipelines. therefore, inspection personnel can prioritise the inspection schedule on the high risk areas

 	 Construction industry as a sector that contribute 4–8% to gross domestic product (gdp) need to improve their ability both state own contractors and private contractors. with the improvement of ability, contruction company will able to compete in domestic and international. in order to improve company ability, construction company need as early as possible to make corrective action in form of control system toward factors that can influence successfullness of the company. Few factors that affected and be determined of company successfulness are: internal factors, external factors, and market forces. external factors are a factor that is out of stakeholders control and need to anticipate early. external factors commonly are dominated by government regulation which is giving legal aspect outside monetary aspect, material ability, project safety, low cost competitors, money depreciation, technological changes, natural disasters, lack of material and worker. The research objective discussed in this paper is to identify the corrective action of the problems arise in a construction company’s external factors that influence the company’s success performance. The methods used are literature studies and survey for identifying the problems and lesson learned corrective action. Analyses used in this research are statistical analysis and delphi method. the results show the corrective actions are implemented toward the cause of the problems by regarding its effects (as a risk factor) whether the highest risk or the lowest risk, and also considering that those corrective actions are preventive and anticipative actions in order to decrease the external problems in the construction company

 	 To fulfil the needs of proper housing for public, the government have made some strategies that set on the national plan of mid term development year 2004–2009, the plan containing the availability of facility and infrastructure of low-budgeted housing area, in which one of the project is the construction of 60,000 units low-cost apartments (rusunawa) and 250,000 low cost leased apartment (rusunami) that dedicated for public with low income. The construction is involving private sector. the limited budget has pushed the government to persuade the private sector to involve on the construction project. one of the cooperation schemes that offered to the private sector is build-operate-transfer. this scheme is become an alternative to attract the private sector to involve on the construction project. however, build-operate-transfer scheme has an uncertainty on the investment return. Risk assessment should be made in order to the answer the uncertainty of investment return. identification and analysis of the risk factor is become the subject of this research that expected can be a consideration to the private sector in risk simulating and therefore can produce a clear picture on the opportunity and risk on the investment, this picture is expected can attract the private sector to join on the rusunawa investment. interpretation of identification on the research is carried out through analysis on stake holder and rank sorting with analytical hierarchy process (ahp) also regression analysis that applied to investment risk research. complicated bureaucracy, difficulties on licenses issuance, and uncontrollable inflation are identified as the significant risk factors that affect the rusunawa investment. this research is also expected can assist the government to attract the private sector in succeeding the public housing project

 	 Acoustic emission; Low speed bearing; Lubrication condition.
 	 This paper investigates the capability of acoustic emission technique in monitoring and accessing the lubrication condition in a low speed rolling element bearing (reb) operating with constant speed of 47 rpm. the rig consists of a motor/gearbox system, a test bearing (47 rpm) and a hydraulic cylinder ram. the bearing test rig employed for this study is a spherical roller bearing selected from a split cooper bearing and subjected to 1000 psi and 2000 psi load via a hydraulic cylinder ram. measurements have been carried out using of a physical acoustic corporation (pac) broad band ae transducer model wdi and the amplification is provided with by a pac pre-amplifier type 1220a. four simulations of various grease fillings up to full, a quarter full, half full capacity and dry condition have been carried out. the time domain parameters which have been utilized are rms and energy. the results of this study can be exploited to bring information from the lubrication condition to determine the suitable lubrication filling for the bearing. thus, the lubrication of the bearing can be improved and the lifetime of the bearing lengthen. it is expected that the properly lubricated bearing element will transmit more energy of ae signal compared to a poorly lubricated bearing, as there would be more contact between asperity points and lubricant. the results of the experiment indicate that the values of rms and energy are capable to distinguish various lubricant conditions in the bearing. the obtained results show that the rms and energy values increase with the increment of lubricant amount in the low speed bearing housing. this phenomenon is different from the results normally obtained in a high speed reb
