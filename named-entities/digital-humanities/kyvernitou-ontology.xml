<ORGANIZATION>University College London UCL</ORGANIZATION> Abstract The need for organising and digitally processing the vast amount of Cultural Heritage CH information has recently led to the development of formal knowledge representation models ontologies for the CH domain Existing models however do not capture gender related concepts This article presents an effort to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered concepts in CH resources The new ontology named GenderedCHContents resulted from combined research in women s studies gender theory and computer science Its primary aim is to draw attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts The proposed ontology extends the Europeana Data Model EDM with twenty two new classes sixteen object properties and seven datatype properties The article presents a demonstration of the GenderedCHContents ontology s use in five different representation tasks which describe five resources related to <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s myth Lastly the study stresses the benefits of reasoning support i e enabling computers to infer further information from a set of asserted facts in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships between metaphorical concepts along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the users Introduction 1 The GenderedCHContents ontology is a formal model for semantically describing gendered aspects of the content of Cultural Heritage CH resources It has been designed by extracting relevant concepts from five different artefacts two textual resources and three digital images depicting Pandora We chose <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s myth because it forms a representative sample of ancient beliefs about the creation of the first woman and an example which displays a variety of metaphors regarding women s roles and characteristics Further by using resources from different periods 8th 7th and 5th centuries BC and 16th and 19th centuries AD which are inspired by the same myth and thus by representing different implementations of the same myth the ontology enables users to compare and obtain insights about the historical backgrounds and the gendered ideas that each resource entails Therefore this study aims to evoke a critical representation of gender ideals in a historical perspective see Section Scope and Overview of the Ontology 2 With this ontology we aim to open the way to bridge the gap of querying and accessing semantic data on the Web related to gender concepts i e <ORGANIZATION>GenderRoles GenderIdentity GenderedTraits</ORGANIZATION> etc through a semantics based representation of the content of CH artefacts that is focusing on the description of graphic or literal representation of entities within the CH artefacts The ontology is extensible so that further gender related concepts can be added as extensions e g subclasses to its current structure 3 This study is focused on women but at the same time the designed ontology enables the representation of figures of all genders and statuses The focus on women is justified as an attempt to underline the importance of combining Semantic Web applications and gender studies in order to reduce the gap between online historical representations of women on the Semantic Web We approach gender as a mode of social construct which represents roles norms and meanings that different societies assign to men and women Thus we chose to use the term gender in the GenderedCHContents ontology since gender is what societies make of the biological differences between males and females and the things associated with them on account of their real or imagined sexual characteristics <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> 2015 As <PERSON>Kirkup</PERSON> notes gender is seen as a property of individuals social structures and symbolic systems Gender relations are at the same time power relations which lead to unequal access to material resources Kirkup 2000 3 In this framework the ontology can be seen as a semantic tool for organising and accessing gender related concepts but also as a means to enable semantics based search over the Web e g such as in http collection britishmuseum org This is a more efficient and effective way to retrieve CH artefacts in relation to gender compared to traditional keyword based search 4 In order to represent the gendered contents of CH artefacts so that this information can be more accessible on the Web we used technologies from the Semantic Web To develop the GenderedCHContents we extended the Europeana Data Model EDM which acts as an integration medium for collecting connecting and enriching descriptions of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> s CH data Europeana 2014 8 We took into consideration the restrictions and capabilities of the Web Ontology Language OWL and the feminist criticism of ontologies and Artificial intelligence AI 1 The main reasons for choosing OWL as the ontology language were its compliance with the Resource Description Framework RDF which is the standard metadata model for the Web its ability to express complex semantic relationships among the objects represented in CH artefacts and its support for inference which makes it possible to deduce further ontological knowledge not explicit in the code Finally we used the Prot g ontology editor to implement and validate the ontology 2 5 We first present the theoretical and technical background of our work We then present the GenderedCHContents ontology and a demonstration of its use in five different representation tasks related to <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s myth Finally we summarise and discuss our plans for further validation of the ontology Background and Related Work Feminism and Computer Science 6 Feminist theories of gender and technology as <PERSON>Wajcman</PERSON> points out have changed perspectives over the years In the 1960s early second wave feminism generated a fatalism which focused on the role of technology in reproducing patriarchy On the other hand during the 1990s cyberfeminism approached digital technologies as inherently liberatory for women Wajcman 2007 287 Recently feminist scholars such as <PERSON>Faulkner Faulker</PERSON> 2001 Oudshoorn et al Oudshoorn et al 2004 and Wajcman Wajcman 2004 have followed a co construction approach to gender and technology criticising technological determinism Wajcman 2007 287 288 This determinism as Bj rkman discusses was detected in feminist gender works regarding computer science CS where research focused on gender equality aspects and CS was seen as neutral and objective <ORGANIZATION>Bj</ORGANIZATION> rkman 2005 179 Contrary to this belief our study approaches the relationship between gender and technology as one of mutual shaping where neither gender nor technology is taken to be pre existing nor is the relationship between them immutable Wajcman 2007 288 Therefore we do not approach CS as neutral on the contrary we chose a gendered vocabulary when designing the GenderedCHContents ontology in order to fill the gap of representing gendered concepts on the Semantic Web see Section The GenderedCHContents Ontology 7 We acknowledge that the task of combining feminist theories and computer science is epistemologically challenging On the one hand feminists have criticised universal categorical distinctions On the other hand ontologies use abstract sets of elements called classes to group together specific objects with shared properties to represent a domain Despite this contradiction we chose to create a structured representation of gendered information to describe CH contents and demonstrate the socially constructed nature of categorical distinctions By making this information available and retrievable we aim to enable users to analyse the historically and socially constructed views on gender as found in CH artefacts We took into consideration <PERSON>Lorber</PERSON> s call for a feminist de gendering movement in order to change the embedded gendered social order by targeting the processes and practices of gendering and their outcome gendered people practices and power Lorber 2000 80 90 91 Specifically the study suggests a gendered vocabulary to enable the retrieval of gendered contents Secondly it opens the path for a de gendered methodology in annotating CH objects by firstly acknowledging and representing the gendered norms found within artefacts 8 The study takes into account the feminist epistemological approach of the situatedness of knowledge where all processes that produce knowledge are situated socially culturally and historically Bj rkman 2005 183 Specifically we focus on the Content of CH artefacts and attribute situatedness within the class Entity which is a subclass of <ORGANIZATION>Content Entity Person Animal Object Demigod Deity</ORGANIZATION> represents a figure character depicted on a CH artefact which has specific emotions posture identity roles characteristics etc within a given space time and activity Therefore in this study Entity is perceived as a carrier of gender ideals and the ontology provides the vocabulary to describe Entity and its gender connotations 9 In order to provide a description of an Entity we focus firstly on the information found in the primary source and then on the secondary sources which provide an analysis of the primary sources in terms of content symbolisms and meanings e g to describe <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> as found in <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s Victorian oil painting we consulted <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s description from the book <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s box <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> 1956 108 110 and the <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> Archive website see Section Ontology Validation and Demonstration We are aware that the same content can have multiple subjective readings However we believe that by providing access to different interpretations of the same Entity the user can obtain a more complete and coherent idea of the complexities of the contents of CH artefacts i e <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> might be seen as a symbol of goodness or evilness and both interpretations can be represented with the ontology This may lead to the retrieval of contradictory information which will enable users to do their own analysis and interpretation of the entities roles and significations 10 Furthermore we underline the importance of expressing semantic relationships among the objects represented in CH artefacts by using <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> in line with <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> s view of the web and connecting knowing rather than following a linear and hierarchical structure as practised in catalogues indexing and databases In this spec <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> presents three approaches enhancing browsability as compared to linear searching focusing on nonhierarchical relationships within standards and increasing the functionality of syntagmatic relationships within surrogates <PERSON>Olson</PERSON> 2007 511 12 532 Thus by focusing on representing relationships between concepts the current study aims at demonstrating entities roles and relations with other classes within CH artefacts Semantic Web Overview 11 Semantic Web <PERSON>Berners Lee</PERSON> et al 2001 advocates the representation of information on the Web in a structured machine interpretable format thereby allowing automated reasoning i e enabling computers to detect inconsistencies or infer new information from a set of asserted facts and advanced added value services on the uploaded data The Semantic Web and related semantic technologies build on ontologies which provide a means to formally define the basic terms and relations that comprise the vocabulary of a certain domain of interest As such they essentially represent the schema that the associated data descriptions should follow To be usable in the uncontrolled Web environment ontologies as well as their associated data need to be represented in a uniform platform independent machine interpretable and semantically enriched format using a generic language This need is covered by the standard data model for representing information in the Semantic Web RDF which models data using triples s p o denoting that a subject s is associated with an object o via a property p The RDF Vocabulary Description Language RDFS 3 is an extension of <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> that enables defining domain specific semantics using simple constructs classes properties and individuals and relationships class and property subsumption RDFS also supports some basic types of reasoning via the transitivity of the subsumption hierarchies and its propagation to the classification of individuals into classes properties For even more sophisticated semantics and reasoning OWL and its more recent version OWL2 4 have become dominant These allow more expressive semantics such as the specification of custom properties for relations e g transitivity or symmetry existential or universal quantifiers operations among classes union intersection complement and others These languages have been widely used to model information in different domains including health law culture media geography e governance life sciences and cultural heritage e g such as the <ORGANIZATION>ReDD Observatory</ORGANIZATION> project the <ORGANIZATION>Linked Jazz</ORGANIZATION> research project GoodRelations ontology the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> Web the Research Space project and the Open Government Data 5 <ORGANIZATION>Cultural Heritage</ORGANIZATION> and Gendered Artefacts 12 <PERSON>Doerr</PERSON> describes CH as the material evidence of human activities of social relevance in the past and he explores the characterisations of the discourse in CH as reflected in data structures and ontologies Doerr 2009 464 <PERSON>Doerr</PERSON> also underlines that in order to handle information about all the different kinds of CH artefacts the use of rich terminology is needed He notes that formal ontologies deal not only with technical problems but also with intellectual challenges in the approximation of intuitive or traditional concepts by logical definitions such as the possible narrower and wider meanings of the same term objective declaration of discriminating features or fuzzy transitions of instances from one class to another Doerr 2009 465 Moreover he notes that there is not an adequate formalisation of the major terminological systems in the sector of CH but as he suggests this may be overcome by a gradual transfer of know how and better appreciation of the specifics of cultural conceptualization by ontology engineers Doerr 2009 465 These observations were taken into consideration to decide which terms to use in the ontology in order to represent classes and properties Specifically we referred to the Encyclopedia of Gender and Society O <PERSON>Brien</PERSON> 2009 for choosing the gendered vocabulary and the definitions of terms see Section The GenderedCHContents Ontology 13 Oudshoorn et al used two different approaches to theorising the gendering of CH artefacts the genderscript approach which captures all the work involved in the inscription and de inscription of representations of masculinities and femininities in technological artefacts Oudshoorn et al 2002 473 and the domestication approach which emphasises the role of people in attributing gender to objects Oudshoorn et al 2002 471 They see artefacts as embodiments and a materialisation of social relations Oudshoorn et al 2002 471 In addition they criticise the fact that in contemporary culture material objects are not perceived as social agents but on the contrary they are perceived as socially neutral and thus they empower and maintain their embodied social relations Oudshoorn et al 2002 471 Oudshoorn et al also note that feminists have shown how gender is further imprinted onto objects through instructions advertisements associations with gendered divisions of labor and associations with gender symbols and myths Oudshoorn et al 2002 472 473 Further they emphasise the importance of studying the inscription of gender into artefacts as this helps understand the ways in which technologies enable or not specific performances of gender identities and relations In other words technologies can influence the ways in which hegemonic representations of gender are perceived Oudshoorn et al 2002 473 14 These considerations made the current study aims to identify and semantically annotate gendered entities symbols myths and metaphors within CH objects by suggesting a specific gendered vocabulary We acknowledge that there are some issues with regard to simplistic identification of such relations i e assuming transparency of these relations within objects The study aims to avoid simplifications by consulting secondary sources and their analysis of CH objects when describing the contents of these artefacts in order to provide access to different interpretations of gender relations etc within artefacts 15 Further as Bath underlines the view of gender as inscribed in artefacts raises the danger of social determinism leading us to assume for example that the social determines the technological Bath n d Bath s work on de gendering information technologies focuses on artefacts and their design aiming not at a gender neutral technology or at creating a technological space where gender does not matter but at preventing technology design from gendering processes Bath n d Bath mentions that a contextual analysis of the specific technology must be made in order to identify gendering processes and find design methodologies that enable the modelling of the de gendered technology Bath n d The study takes the above into account but rather than de gendering technology the proposed gendered vocabulary in the GenderedCHContents ontology is intended to open the way of identifying gendering processes in CH artefacts It does so by making gendered contents accessible in order to enable users to gain insights into inscribed cultural norms and gender beliefs in different historical periods 16 Moreover our study aligns with <PERSON>Mulvey</PERSON> s view on representations of women in art as presented in the Encyclopedia of Gender and Society Specifically <PERSON>Mulvey</PERSON> as cited in O <PERSON>Brien O Brien</PERSON> 2009 pointed out that since art and virtual culture are not merely reflections but also sites of construction of gender identities they make an apt site for feminist and queer interventions through the production of alternative representations O Brien 2009 44 Thus by acknowledging that CH artefacts are reflections of views of different societies the focus of the ontology on metaphors aims to reveal these social reflections It is also acknowledged that woman is not a solid and unchanged concept but is connected to ideas of specific periods places and societies Ontologies for Cultural Heritage and Narrative Representation 17 The international standard for the representation and exchange of CH information is the Documentation of the <ORGANIZATION>International Council of Museums CIDOC</ORGANIZATION> Conceptual Reference Model CRM This ontology facilitates the integration mediation and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information Le Boeuf et al 2015 1 The GenderedCHContents ontology builds upon the EDM which collects connects and enriches the descriptions provided by Europeana content providers EDM is aligned to CIDOC CRM in its definition of an event centric model In order to implement its tasks the EDM uses two main categories Firstly it re uses elements from other namespaces specifically from the <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> and the RDFS namespaces the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange OAI ORE namespace the Simple Knowledge Organization System SKOS namespace the <ORGANIZATION>Dublin Core</ORGANIZATION> namespaces for properties from the elements terms and types namespaces the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary DCAT namespace and the Creative Commons CC namespace 6 Secondly it uses the elements introduced by EDM Europeana 2014 8 18 Despite the development of these ontologies as <PERSON>Doerr</PERSON> comments museums do not show an interest in using discrete schema elements to analyse iconographic representations Doerr 2009 474 Similarly <PERSON>Damiano</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lieto</PERSON> underline that there is a contradiction between the huge quantity of resources published on the Web in recent years and the inadequate way that these resources are described As they note the way they are described is far from meeting the requirements of content based access required by the general public neither their description in terms of editorial metadata nor the tags added by users seem adequate to describe the content of media resources and fall short of providing an effective access to digital media <PERSON>Damiano</PERSON> and Lieto 2013 76 19 By developing the GenderedCHContents ontology we suggest that a content based description of artefacts is essential especially in the field of CH in order to facilitate the retrieval of gender related concepts and encourage different interpretations of CH artefacts As <PERSON>Damiano</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lieto</PERSON> further mention media studies show that users when tagging artworks tend to describe the content of the artworks <PERSON>Damiano</PERSON> and Lieto 2013 76 Therefore a description of the content of CH artefacts could be useful to users in order for them to obtain a more holistic idea of the represented artworks or even question and rethink represented gender norms and beliefs 20 Different story ontologies have also been developed recently aiming to model narrative concepts For example the <ORGANIZATION>BBC s News Storyline Ontology</ORGANIZATION> is a generic model that describes and organises the stories that news organisations present but it is focused on the representation of news rather than on CH artwork stories 7 On the other hand the Contextus Project aims to allow people to explore and analyse narratives in heterogeneous media through the annotation of those works with semantic descriptions Describing Narrative in the Digital World n d Further the Stories ontology was developed in collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> to create an ontology for narrative representation that could be applied across a diverse set of cases Linked Open Vocabularies n d Moreover within the same project the OntoMedia ontology was developed in order to represent heterogeneous media by semantically describing their content Thus its scope is to enable users to have easy access to the type of details that previously would have been impractical to search for due to the sheer effort it would have taken to collect and correlate OntoMedia n d 21 Another example the Labyrinth system which is targeted at CH dissemination and digital publishing focuses on the notion of cultural archetype and is based on the Archetype ontology <PERSON>Damiano</PERSON> and Lieto 2013 77 This ontology has been designed to support reasoning on the relations among characters actions and stories while abstracting from different genres and media types <PERSON>Damiano</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Lieto</LOCATION> 2013 77 Its role based schema is closer to the aims of this study since the focus of the GenderedCHContents ontology is centred on the concept Entity Person Animal Object Demigod Deity The current study therefore was influenced by Archetype s aim but did not follow the same developing strategies in defining the basic concepts and properties because the central role here is found within entities and their gender relations rather than on the stories The <ORGANIZATION>GenderedCHContents Ontology Scope</ORGANIZATION> and Overview of the Ontology 22 The GenderedCHContents ontology see Figure 1 was developed as an extension of the EDM to semantically describe gendered CH contents Since EDM does not provide the capability for representing gendered concepts we focused on filling this gap EDM uses <ORGANIZATION>Dublin Core</ORGANIZATION> s property dc description which may include but is not limited to an abstract a table of contents a graphical representation or a free text account of the resource DCMI Metadata Terms n d Since EDM specifies that it is mandatory to supply either a dc description or a dc title Europeana 2014 51 for a resource it is evident that limited information about the content of the resource is provided to the user and when provided it is in a free text form Currently users can search the Europeana website using keywords search terms they can also browse its material using facets for collections media terms of use providing country language aggregator and institution There is no facet however related to the content of artefacts see Figure 2 image Figure 1 Graphical Representation of the GenderedCHContents Ontology The code of the ontology is available at https github com ucldis dh blob master GenderedCHContents owl Accessed 5 Dec 2016 23 Moreover the description of a resource is represented by the underlying ontology via an annotation property and therefore has the form of flat text As a result to retrieve a resource based on the description of its content the user has to use the exact keywords from the description of the resource which makes the task even more difficult This is because annotation properties do not carry any meaning under the direct semantics of the ontology language <PERSON>Antoniou</PERSON> et al 2012 104 In the GenderedCHContents ontology we represent gendered concepts and their relationships using classes object and datatype rather than annotation properties enabling a semantics based description of gendered contents image Figure 2 Screen shot of the Europeana website displaying the search results when entering the word <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> Accessed 30 Jan 2017 Procedure 24 The general steps we followed for the creation of the ontology were the following first we represented the relevant concepts as ontology classes by choosing the gendered vocabulary and its definitions as found in the Encyclopedia of Gender and Society O <PERSON>Brien</PERSON> 2009 while investigating and extracting relevant concepts from the textual and pictorial representations of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> in five resources Specifically we used information from two textual resources Hesiod s Theogony and Work and Days 8th 7th century BC We also used three digital images of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> from respectively the red figured wine bowl calyx krater vase of the classical period attributed to the Niobid Painter the 16th century <PERSON>Pieter Serwouter</PERSON> s engraving and <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s Victorian oil painting 1871 see Figures 3a b c By semantically describing the figure of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> as expressed in resources from different periods we aimed to explore the different implementations of the myth and enable a comparative representation of the notion of woman over place and time The GenderedCHContents ontology provides abstract classes to describe individual objects as found in the resources Even if we use universal abstract terms to describe a set of elements i e Content Entity Person we focus on the individual partial and locatable information that each artefact entails image Figure 3 Image of the red figured calyx krater displaying the creation of <ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION> 8 Figure 3b Image of <PERSON>Serwouter</PERSON> s engraving nl <ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION> en Epimetheus 9 Figure 3c Image of <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s Victorian oil painting of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> 10 25 Hesiod s Theogony and Work and Days are the first to narrate <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s creation and the other sources are representatives of the myth in different historical periods the red figured wine bowl calyx krater vase of the classical period <PERSON>Pieter Serwouter</PERSON> s engraving of the early modern period and <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s oil painting for Victorian period We based our semantic description of the red figured wine bowl vase see Figure 3a on the investigation of the digital image of the vase in the <ORGANIZATION>British Museum s Collection</ORGANIZATION> online database and on its online description 11 Similarly for <PERSON>Serwouter</PERSON> s engraving of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> see Figure 3b we considered the online digital description available on the Europeana website Europeana 2014 and that from the book <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s box <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> 1956 80 82 We used the same book as a source of information for <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s Victorian oil painting of <PERSON>Pandora Panofsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> 1956 108 110 see Figure 3c for this painting we also considered relevant information from the <ORGANIZATION>Rossetti Archive</ORGANIZATION> website 12 For Theogony and Work and Days we used their English translations which we found in the Perseus website 13 26 The second step consisted of defining the ontology properties that relate the ontology classes specifying the property characteristics and constraints over the elements of the ontology We then instantiated the ontology with individuals or instances of the classes which are the basic ground level components of an ontology and with property assertions statements to describe <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> in the five resources 27 The benefit of providing a structure of abstract classes and their relationships with the classes to which the individual objects belong is that it enables the formation of semantic annotations and as a result the semantics based retrieval and access to that specific information For example <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> is an instance of the class Person and is also related to other classes in that it has specific GenderRoles GenderIdentity GenderedTraits see Section Main Classes By semantically annotating her description in different CH artefacts the user can obtain insights about her depiction and her roles within a primary source and compare that representation with other sources of different periods Thus the ontology provides the schema to represent gendered descriptions of CH artefacts This however does not mean that all classes or properties need to be used when describing an artefact since for each individual artefact this description may vary i e correspond to multiple classes and relationships or some classes and properties might not always be applicable for certain instances Main Classes 28 The GenderedCHContents ontology contains twenty two classes which form the conceptual representations of the CH artefacts gendered content see Figure 4 These extend the EDM by adding twenty two new classes defined as subclasses of E89_Propositional_Object which EDM reuses from <LOCATION>CIDOC</LOCATION> CRM and it is equivalent to edm InformationResource image Figure 4 Classes and subclasses of the ontology Screen shot of Prot g 29 The class E89_Propositional_Object as defined by <ORGANIZATION>CIDOC CRM</ORGANIZATION> comprises immaterial items like stories plots procedural prescriptions algorithms laws of physics or images that are or represent in some sense sets of propositions about real or imaginary things and that are documented as single units or serve as topic of discourse Moreover it comprises items that are about something in the sense of a subject Le Boeuf et al 2015 33 34 Similarly edm <ORGANIZATION>InformationResource</ORGANIZATION> is a resource whose essential characteristics can be conveyed in a single message and it has a URI and a representation Europeana 2014 14 30 We extended the EDM with a new class named Content see Figure 4 which we defined as a subclass of E89_Propositional_Object for it provides a description of the content of CH artefacts This new class represents the thematic topics that each resource is related with In the case of literary resources Content refers to what is said in a literary work as opposed to how it is said <PERSON>Baldick</PERSON> 2008 and in the case of visual resources to describe what is depicted on them The thematic topics are usually the results of an interpretation of the meaning of CH artefacts which takes into account their historical and cultural context 31 Although each content consists of a narrative we decided not to include the term narrative in the class Content in order to emphasise that content contains a narrative which is expressed through some medium in this case an image or a text Thus by using the term Content we applied the more general concept which denotes the connection with the form and context of CH artefacts 32 We added three new classes Non representationalContent RepresentationalContent and SignifiedConcepts as subclasses of Content see Figure 4 The first two are used to distinguish artefacts based on the structure of their contents Non representationalContent refers to abstract and non figurative art or literary description which does not aim to reference reality whereas RepresentationalContent refers to depictions of figures etc This distinction is not absolute in the sense that an artefact may be associated to more than one of the subtypes of content 33 The class SignifiedConcepts borrows the term signified from Semiotics Saussure et al 1986 and is used to connote meanings that entities may carry and in this case meanings related to gender symbolisms We defined this class as a subclass of Content to show that every Entity which is a subclass of Content can potentially refer or stand for something other than itself see Figure 5 This class enables the representation of metaphors related to women and thus an illustration of these symbolisms through the meanings that the concepts convey For example HesiodsTheogonyPandora isAssociatedWith Laziness see Section Ontology Validation and Demonstration Metaphors We declared all other classes of our ontology e g Entity Body EmbodiedActivity etc as subclasses of RepresentationalContent since this superclass contains all the representational entities which convey descriptive characteristics about gender image Figure 5 Description of the class SignifiedConcepts 34 The core concept of this ontology is the class Entity which is the starting point for detecting describing and accessing figures of women within a content Entity includes the subclass Person which represents all women s figures Entity contains all entities that have distinct and independent existence being and form Therefore Animal Object Deity and Demigod are also subclasses of this class We declared Person as equivalent to foaf Person that EDM reuses from Friend of a Friend FOAF the Person class represents people Something is a Person if it is a person We don t nitpic about whether they re alive dead real or imaginary FOAF Vocabulary Specification n d 14 35 Unlike FOAF our ontology differentiates between real and imaginary people by using two subclasses of Person RealPerson and UnrealPerson The first refers to people who lived in real life there is historical evidence of their existence whereas UnrealPerson refers to all characters and figures that are fictional mythological and imaginary With this grouping we aim to reveal different ideas about characteristics and roles that historical and imaginary entities represent in specific contents The ontology can be further extended in the future by adding properties which can demonstrate similarities and differences between the two classes We acknowledge that the categorisation of CH artefacts can be a complex process in that for example it is not historically clear if the ancient Greeks believed in their myths Veyne 1988 and if <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> was seen as a historical or as a mythological figure in <ORGANIZATION>Hesiod</ORGANIZATION> s period or even whether she was perceived as a mythological figure in the classical period The ontology offers the flexibility to support all these different presumptions by enabling an individual e g <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> to belong to one of or both subclasses of Person <PERSON>RealPerson</PERSON> and UnrealPerson demonstrating the complexity of interpreting the content of CH resources 36 Deity class refers to supernatural beings and conveys ideas about the sacred Since images of deities reflect and shape understandings of sexual difference and the cultural meanings attached to biological sex this class is used here as a resource that can illustrate beliefs and cultural visions providing insights into social behaviour O Brien 2009 191 Moreover Demigod is defined as a class that has partially divine and partially human characteristics The Object class refers to all material things and the Animal class to all living organisms which feed on organic matter 37 Further we added the class Body and its subclass Posture This refers to the position of the body to gestures and to bodily attitudes to represent norms and ideals about standard body shapes that are culturally expressed in intentional and unintentional ways O <PERSON>Brien</PERSON> 2009 82 Body refers to the physical structure of a living entity Also since cultural economic and political factors are literally visible on the bodies of society members O <PERSON>Brien</PERSON> 2009 86 we added the classes EmbodiedAppearance and EmbodiedActivity to examine and analyse bodily representations of entities and their actions 38 EmbodiedAppearance which refers to the way a body looks has three subclasses Accessories Hairstyle and Dress see Figure 4 It designates gender differentiated body conceptions which reflect a conception of men and women as essentially different O <PERSON>Brien</PERSON> 2009 86 This class aims to represent different appearances in order to demonstrate how human bodies can vary aiming to question the absolutist classifications of dominant sex gender understandings O <PERSON>Brien</PERSON> 2009 86 87 Accessory refers to all things that complement a person s appearance Hairstyle to the way in which an entity s hair is cut and arranged and Dress to the clothing that entities wear To describe any type of appearance that does not fall under one of the three subclasses e g body painting one can either directly associate it to the main class EmbodiedAppearance or extend the ontology by adding another relevant subclass 39 EmbodiedActivity refers to the performance of an entity engaging in a set of behaviours that display an individual s gender identity as female or male and that cause the individual to be so perceived during social interaction O Brien 2009 366 GenderedTraits pertains to the characteristics ascribed in the sources to a specific entity It aims to represent these traits and relate them with an entity s identities GenderIdentity represents gender identities as described by or as performed in the resources By creating the class GenderIdentity we aimed to include all categorisations that have been historically made and based on these to represent all the different relations between identities roles emotions and embodied activities Further the GenderRoles class refers to the distinct social roles assigned to men and women Gender role is understood as a set of expected actions and dispositions ascribed to an individual on the basis of her or his assumed biological sex O Brien 2009 371 GenderedSkills refers to stereotypically gendered activities that genders may perform such as cooking being female fighting being male Finally the class GenderedEmotions represents the feelings that derive from an entity which might be symbolically gendered even if men and women do not manifest it differently <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> 2015 Properties 40 The second step in developing the ontology was to determine the relationships within the ontology For this purpose we created sixteen object properties see Figure 6 image Figure 6 The Object Properties of the Ontology 41 All properties except isAssociatedWith isSymbolFor and symbolises have Entity as their domain This choice underlines the focus on the Entity class to represent the gendered characteristics roles emotions etc which this class relates with In order to represent the appearance of an entity we added the hasAppearance property with EmbodiedAppearance as range The hasAppearance has two subproperties hasHairstyle and wears with ranges Hairstyle and Dress respectively to demonstrate the physical characteristics and appearance of the figure The bears property also contributes to the descriptive representation of the entity since it has Accessory or Entity as range describing any accessories e g bags or living beings e g babies that someone may bear The poses property with Posture as range denotes movements of the body gestures body position and attitudes connected to the body To describe an activity that an entity is engaged in we added the property performsActivity with EmbodiedActivity as range We also added the hasGenderRoleOf property with GenderRoles as range to describe an entity s social role To demonstrate the different GenderedSkills GenderedEmotions GenderedTraits and GenderIdentity of an entity we added the four following properties which respectively have the above classes as their ranges HasSkills hasEmotions isCharacterisedAs hasGenderIdentity The relation between different entities can be described using the relatesWith property which we defined as symmetric since it is equivalent to its inverse <PERSON>Antoniou</PERSON> et al 2012 106 42 In order to represent the symbolisms that concepts entail we created the symbolises property with Content as domain and SignifiedConcepts as range This means that each entity that is part of a content potentially denotes a specific meaning Further in order to connect the symbol signifier to the signified idea meaning we added two more properties which are inverse to each other isSymbolFor and isSymbolisedBy The latter has Entity as domain and Content as range and vice versa for isSymbolFor With this model entities that have the role of symbols in specific contents and entities that are described by symbols are equally represented In order to connect an entity that has a symbolic metaphorical meaning with a concept that is related with the same meaning we defined the isAssociatedWith property with SignifiedConcepts as domain and Entity as range The ontology also reuses some of EDM s object properties in order to demonstrate the subject of the resource and to relate it with other similar resources 43 In addition to the object properties we also added seven datatype properties see Figure 7 that associate instances of the class Entity to certain data values e g numbers strings or dates The domain of all these properties is therefore Entity and the range is rdfs Literal which is a built in <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> class image Figure 7 The Data Properties of the Ontology 44 Specifically hasRelationToGenderNorms denotes whether a certain entity through its embodied activity appearance and role complies with the gender norms ascribed to the individual s gender within its historical framework This categorisation can be made by consulting secondary sources which analyse stereotypical behaviours and gender norms in the period in which an entity is presented e g for women s roles in the ancient world <PERSON>James</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dillon</PERSON> s <PERSON>James</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dillon</PERSON> 2015 and <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON> s Cohen 1994 works can be consulted This property enables a representation of women s figures that repudiate specific norms and roles It takes either complied or not complied as its value In this way the ontology can be seen as a research resource for identifying the changes between following or changing the ascribed gender norms in different CH artefacts 45 Another important aspect that we attempt to implement with this ontology is the association of a figure with its social circumstances in order to show the link between social economical and political factors that may influence and partially determine a figure For this reason we added the properties hasSocialStatus and hasSocialClass which describe an individual s social position and reflect the roles activities and identities that an individual holds within a social system The acceptable values for hasSocialStatus are has status no status This simplified model aims to be as inclusive as possible Therefore by denoting whether an entity has a status or not we can group entities based on this characteristic We acknowledge that in some situations this is not applicable or may be seen as an absolute classification However as a first step it would be interesting to gather figures that apply to this model and as a second step reconsider the use and naming of the specified values The same applies to the property hasSocialClass since the only values it accepts are lower middle upper and not applicable The limitation of this design is that these values classify an individual with values that represent social systems from the eighteenth century onwards reflecting capitalist societies whereas structures of earlier societies are not represented 15 For this reason we included not applicable as an acceptable value to demonstrate that this is not the only hierarchical classification and that it cannot be universally applied 46 Another aspect captured by the ontology is the way that an entity is associated with health We made this design choice because there is a broad literature referring to women and health and how women are connected to mental disorders like hysteria etc in different historical periods see e g Annandale 2008 <PERSON>Tasca</PERSON> et al 2012 <PERSON>Gilman</PERSON> et al 1993 King 1998 and King 2009 The property hasStateOfHealth with acceptable values healthy mentioned illness not mentioned and unhealthy aims to classify each individual according to a specific state of health as represented within the resource Therefore it enables the retrieval of cases where mentioned recognisable illness or representations of women in unhealthy states are displayed This will make it possible for researchers to identify the kind of illness that a figure is illustrated with and reflect on ideas about health and body 47 The study takes into account the concept of the space time fixity constraint that binds activities or series of acts to a specific place and moment in chronological time Schwanen et al 2008 2109 It also takes into consideration attempts to deconstruct dominant understanding s of time through for example drawing our attention to women s time as embodied in daily life Odih 1999 10 The term relational time was introduced in feminist discourse to describe an experience of time that exists in relation to an embeddedness in embodied social relations Also since it is mediated through significant others as <PERSON>Odih</PERSON> notes relational time is shared rather than personal and thus sensitive to the contextuality and particularity of interpersonal relations Odih 1999 10 In order to represent the space time in which a character entity exists as presented in the sources we added two datatype properties actsWithinSpace and performsWithinTime The former enables the semantic annotation of space and has rdfs Literal as its range It therefore accepts any used defined values that denote space Some possible values are abstract to represent a non representational space place indoors or outdoors private or public and specified or non specified to denote whether there is a recognisable named place The use of terms public and private aims to incorporate gendering theories of spaces 16 when this information is transparent and map the spaces where entities are presented This is not an exhaustive list depending of the content new values can be added to describe space efficiently Moreover actsWithinSpace has actsWithinGenderedSpace as a subproperty to allow the semantic annotation of gendered spaces i e women s quarters in households gender specific restrictions in baths and temples etc where this information is transparent within the artefact Currently performsWithinTime accepts the following values abstract when time is not specified ancient period 3600 BC 500 AD medieval period 500 1500 early modern period 1500 1750 and modern period 1500 present to specify the historical time period in which an entity is presented day and night narrative past narrative present and narrative future to represent cases where an entity is clearly presented within a narrative and her his actions descriptions etc refer to an explicit past present or future of narrative time The ontology provides the flexibility to add new values for representing more fine grained dates Property and Class Axioms 48 The third step of ontology development was to define restrictions on the classes and properties of the ontology Aiming to develop a generic ontology which enables the representation of as many different resources as possible we only added a small number of restrictions For example although declaring RealPerson and UnrealPerson as disjointed or as complementary to each other seemed to be a reasonable choice we decided not to declare the distinction considering that some resources may represent figures of uncertain historical status 49 We defined one pair of inverse properties isSymbolisedBy and isSymbolFor as mentioned in the previous section to underline the reciprocal relationship between signifier and signified 50 We also defined a property chain as shown below see Figure 8 image Figure 8 Property Chain 51 We defined isAssociatedWith as a property chain of isSymbolisedBy and symbolises This means that if an individual of Entity class isSymbolisedBy a specific content and the content symbolises an individual of SignifiedConcepts class then it is inferred that the same Entity isAssociatedwith the individual of SignifiedConcepts 52 We added a class equivalence axiom to denote that Person is equivalent to foaf Person which EDM reuses since both classes contain exactly the same set of individuals 53 We defined Demigod as the intersection of Deity and UnrealPerson This means that every member of Demigod is also a member of the Deity and <ORGANIZATION>UnrealPerson Ontology Verification</ORGANIZATION> and Validation Overview 54 The verification and validation of the ontology has two goals Vrandecic 2009 295 to verify its correctness with respect to the syntax and semantics of the ontology language OWL in our case and to assess its representational capabilities for modelling the domain it was designed for in our case the gendered concepts in the CH domain To achieve the first goal we used the HermiT OWL Reasoner 17 which is pre installed in Prot g HermiT can check the logical consistency of an ontology but it can also make inferences e g deduce subsumption relationships between classes based on the semantics of OWL We conducted the verification while we were developing the ontology so that we could identify and correct errors early in the development process 55 For our second goal we instantiated the ontology with <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> descriptions of the five resources related to the myth of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> see Section Procedure Description of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> in GenderedCHContents 56 Figure 9 depicts the <ORGANIZATION>RDF</ORGANIZATION> statements that describe <PERSON>Niobid</PERSON> s Pandora She performsActivity stands in the centre of an abstract space and time actsWithinSpace performsWithinTime holding two wreaths her appearance is represented by means of the clothes she wears and her hairstyle ndividuals like LongHairWithADottedFillet Apoptygma and DoricChiton which we added as values of the hasAppearance subproperties wears and hasHairstyle are also directly associated to the hasAppearance property through inference the inferred relationships are in yellow in Figure 9 image Figure 9 Example of Niobid s <ORGANIZATION>Pandora Property Assertions Metaphors</ORGANIZATION> 57 An important feature of the proposed ontology is the representation of metaphors related to gendered contents Examples of metaphors can be detected in Hesiod s Theogony see Figure 10 in Works and Days see Figure 11 and in <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s <ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION> see Figure 15 In these cases inferences can be made in terms of symbolic concepts Specifically Figure 10 depicts the inference that <PERSON>Theogony</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> isAssociatedWith Laziness Figure 11 that Pandora isAssociatedWith PlagueToMen and Figure 15 that she isAssociatedWith Evils This is achieved by the application of the property chain discussed in the previous section image Figure 10 Example of <ORGANIZATION>Hesiod</ORGANIZATION> s Theogony Pandora Property Assertions image Figure 11 Example of <ORGANIZATION>Hesiod s Works</ORGANIZATION> and Days Pandora Property Assertions 58 Drone is connected to <ORGANIZATION>Hesiod</ORGANIZATION> s Theogony Pandora Gift with <ORGANIZATION>Hesiod s Works</ORGANIZATION> and Days <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> and Box with <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> through the property isSymbolisedBy Since these individuals symbolise respectively Laziness PlagueToMen and Evils which are all instances of SignifiedConcepts it is inferred that each Pandora isAssociatedwith these concepts see Figure 12 image Figure 12 Property Assertions of the symbols Drone Gift and Box 59 We also attempted to represent the mythological figures of Vice and Virtues which are referred to in <LOCATION>Serwouter</LOCATION> s accompanying poem and in the engraving see Figures 3b 13 According to the poem <LOCATION>Jupiter</LOCATION> filled <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> s box with good and evil to ensure a balanced state of affairs <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> 1956 82 image Figure 13 Example of <PERSON>Serwouter</PERSON> s <ORGANIZATION>Pandora Property Assertions</ORGANIZATION> 60 When <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> opens the box the Virtues that symbolise good escape into the air and Vice spreads all over the earth Thus as depicted in Figure 14 Vice and Virtues are connected to the box through the relatesWith property and the concepts that they symbolise appear as values of the property symbolises It is therefore inferred that Evils are associated with Vice and the signified concept of evil Also <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> see Figure 15 associates with the evils that come out of the box but in this case Evils have the form of smoke and not an anthropomorphic form which is stated as follows <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> poses EnvelopedBySmokeOfEvils image Figure 14 Property Assertions of Vice Evils and Virtues image Figure 15 Example of <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s <ORGANIZATION>Pandora Property Assertions</ORGANIZATION> 61 In the above examples we also demonstrate the symmetry of relatesWith Another example which demonstrates this feature is this <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> in Serwouter s engraving relatesWith Epimetheus since she is his future wife and therefore it is inferred that <PERSON>Epimetheus</PERSON> relates to <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> see Figure 16 image Figure 16 Example of the symmetric characteristic of the object property relatesWith 62 We classified Virtues using a specific gender identification see Figure 14 We decided to represent them as women to enable the description of their anthropomorphic characteristics but also to capture gendered notions related to women for example the notions of good and evil as traits inherited in woman s nature However although <PERSON>Virtues</PERSON> may appear to have a female bodily figure see Figure 3b they still have non human characteristics such as the ability to fly Therefore we additionally classified them as UnrealPerson Thus by simultaneously representing Virtues as RealPerson and UnrealPerson the ontology enables the description of this instance using characteristics of both classes 63 Lastly similarities in appearance like long dress wreath crown and beauty as expressed in different periods are aspects that our ontology can also capture Accordingly by using for example the edm isSimilarTo property to connect <PERSON>Niobid</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> to the other two digital artworks of <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> and considering that this property is a subproperty of dc relation it can be inferred that <PERSON>Niobid</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> is related to those artworks The benefit of extending the EDM is evident in the last example where our ontology enables us to interrelate all resources that share the same or relevant topic and contents see Figure 17 image Figure 17 RDF Description of <ORGANIZATION>Niobid</ORGANIZATION> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>GenderedCHContents Ontology</ORGANIZATION> 64 We conclude that interpretations about the box and the goods and evils that <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> and the box as gifts to men entail are represented differently in the five examples The emotions activities skills and postures are also depicted differently from an emotionless <PERSON>Niobid</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> represented as a wooden statue to <PERSON>Rossetti</PERSON> s <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> where the first woman is transformed to a femme fatale figure <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Panofsky</PERSON> 1956 109 see Figure 15 Further Validation 65 We acknowledge that the specific instantiation of the ontology was only a first step towards its validation As Vrandecic notes most validation approaches require the close cooperation of domain and ontology engineering experts Validation often cannot be performed automatically Vrandecic 2009 295 Therefore as a further step we suggest a more concrete and complete validation in collaboration with experts from the CH domain who will evaluate different aspects of the ontology such as its vocabulary and semantics 18 66 Simultaneously in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ontology in the context of its application we propose as a next step a task based approach to ontology evaluation That is to tag ontological relations from a broader range of artefacts including Psyche s Persephone s <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta</ORGANIZATION> s and <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> s representations in CH artefacts More specifically we suggest using a larger subset of study including these myths in order to test further how the ontology can be applied to semantically represent women and their relation to symbolic objects such as the box in Psyche s myth Apuleius et al 1922 and the symbolic role of the golden apple in <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta</ORGANIZATION> s and <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> s myths 67 This task based evaluation can follow the same procedure we used to represent <PERSON>Pandora</PERSON> in the five CH artefacts see Section Procedure and will describe Psyche s description in Apuleius The golden ass being the metamorphoses of <PERSON>Lucius Apuleius Apuleius</PERSON> et al 1922 and in artworks of different historical periods including Amor and Psyche 1589 by <PERSON>Jacopo Zucchi</PERSON> Psyche Revived by Cupid s Kiss 1793 by <PERSON>Antonio Canova Psych</PERSON> aux enfers 1865 by <PERSON>Eug</PERSON> ne <PERSON>Ernest Hillemacher</PERSON> and Psyche Opening the Golden Box 1903 by <PERSON>John William Waterhouse</PERSON> 19 68 Moreover the works of Colluthus Rape of <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ovidius Metamorphoses</ORGANIZATION> 10 560 ff 20 will be used to represent the judgement of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta</ORGANIZATION> s race with Hippomenes respectively Paintings of these scenes will also be used to semantically annotate relevant contents such us the Athenian red figure vase painting on the Judgement of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> C5th B C <PERSON>Botticelli</PERSON> s Judgement of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 1485 Rubens Judgement of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> 1636 Crispijn van de Passe I after <ORGANIZATION>Maerten de Vos Atalanta</ORGANIZATION> en Hippomenes 1602 1607 <PERSON>Reni</PERSON> s <PERSON>Hippomenes</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta</ORGANIZATION> circa 1620 1622 Colombel s Race between <LOCATION>Atalanta</LOCATION> and Hippomenes 1644 1717 and Hall s Race between <LOCATION>Hippomenes</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Atalanta</LOCATION> 1762 65 21 69 This task based evaluation aims to measure the ontology s performance in representing a range of different descriptions of women and the symbols related to them as found in the CH artefacts Summary and Future Work 70 In this article we propose the GenderedCHContents ontology as an attempt to investigate ways in which different historical artefacts when interpreted today can create a gendered conceptual map of women s representations The development of the ontology is a first step in bringing closer gender studies and Semantic Web technologies aiming to represent semantically gendered contents on the Web We are aware of the possible objections epistemological debate or controversy inherent in any attempt to combine feminism and ontology engineering Nevertheless we consider it vital to pursue and find a way to reconcile even if via compromise these fields in order to semantically represent gendered concepts within CH artefacts 71 Taking into account the expressive power of OWL the proposed ontology captures different types of relationships between gendered concepts and their contexts For example object and datatype properties provide a means to describe certain attributes of CH artefacts and their contents as well as ways in which they may relate to each other The subsumption relation of <ORGANIZATION>OWL</ORGANIZATION> enables a taxonomic representation of the relevant concepts and their relationships property characteristics e g symmetry and axioms e g inverse properties and property chains enable inferring further relationships among the individuals and restrictions on the classes and properties e g value restrictions were used to impose constraints on the range of semantic descriptions that one can create with the ontology Our aim was to create a model which is generic enough to capture most relevant concepts and their relationships concise so that it is easy for users to understand and create their own semantic descriptions but also extensible to further types of information which are not currently captured 72 Finally we suggest a further validation of the ontology by applying a task based evaluation in which the ontology will be tested with other sources Acknowledgements 73 We would
