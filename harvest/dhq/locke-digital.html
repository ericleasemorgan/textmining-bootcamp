                <p>Digital humanities projects and methods are becoming increasingly common in
                    undergraduate humanities classrooms. Digital projects and exercises allow
                    students to engage with new technology, collaborate with peers, graduate
                    students, and faculty, and produce tangible scholarship that is publicly
                    visible. The Lab for the Education and Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR),
                    a new student-focused digital humanities initiative at Michigan State
                    University, has introduced digital components into large numbers of of History
                    and Anthropology courses. Through two years of courses, it has proven fruitful
                    to frame these not as “Digital Humanities projects,” but as
                    part of a digital liberal arts curriculum that seeks to teach students not only
                    about the domain-specific content, but also essential skills for information
                    retrieval and analysis, media literacy, and communication in the digital age.
                    This framework places these skills as extensions of longstanding skills,
                    literacies, and knowledges that humanities and social sciences have contributed
                    towards liberal arts education. </p>

                <blockquote><p class="ptext">
                    We ought to be able not only to find any kind of document on
                        the Web, but also to create any kind of document, easily. We should be able
                        not only to follow links, but to create them–between all sorts of media. We
                        should be able not only to interact with other people, but to create with
                        other people. Intercreativity is the process of making things or solving
                        problems together. If interactivity is not just sitting there passively in
                        front of a display screen, then intercreativity is not just sitting there in
                        front of something 'interactive'.

            <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">As the field of digital humanities continues to gain traction in disciplinary
                departments and in libraries, digital projects and methods are becoming increasingly
                common in undergraduate humanities classrooms. Digital projects and exercises allow
                students to engage with new technology, collaborate with peers, graduate students,
                and faculty, and produce tangible scholarship that is publicly visible. Shining
                examples of these types of experiences are illustrated in edited volumes such as
                    <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Pedagogy</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Teaching History in the Digital Age, </cite>and<cite class="title italic"> Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</cite>, in journals like
                    <cite class="title italic">Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Journal of
                    Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</cite>, at conferences such as ILiADS,
                HASTAC, and Bucknell’s Digital Scholarship Conference, and in numerous blog posts
                and project pages. As Director of the Lab for the Education and Advancement in
                Digital Research (LEADR), a lab specializing in digital research for students in
                humanities and social sciences at Michigan State University, my focus is to develop
                these types of experiences for undergraduate in collaboration with faculty. Through
                working with faculty, librarians, graduate students, and undergraduates, we have
                begun to frame these not as “Digital Humanities projects,” but as
                part of a digital liberal arts curriculum. This frames our work as teaching students
                about the domain-specific content, alongside essential skills for information
                retrieval and analysis, media literacy, and communication in the digital age.<a class="noteRef" href="locke-digital.html#d37466e213">[1]</a> This intentional focus on crucial
                critical thinking and skills in the digital realm is the result of our students’
                lack of knowledge and skills in using digital media and tools for communication and
                critical analysis, and is backed by research on technology use in the United
                States.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The World Wide Web that gained commercial success in the early and mid-1990s was very
                much a read-only medium, where only a privileged few had the skills and the
                resources to create material that others could access online. The
                    “read-only” web continued into the new millennium, as a
                sliver of the population began to learn HTML (or software development languages like
                Java) on their own or in colleges and upper-middle class high schools. In the
                mid-2000s, Web 2.0 brought about blogging platforms, wikis, message boards, and
                social media, significantly lowering the barrier to participation. Simultaneously,
                the digital divide began to narrow, largely due to mobile access becoming more
                available to lower-income communities. Today, though the digital divide persists in
                the US in rural, poor, and elderly communities, 84% of American adults use the
                Internet, and over half of US Internet users have posted photos and videos they have
                taken to the web (including 81% of internet users age 18-29), and many more use
                social media, blogs, or personal websites to produce content for the web. With the
                ubiquity of the web as a platform for communication and knowledge production,
                critical digital media production and communication in higher education is worth
                examination [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#perrin2015">Perrin and Duggan 2015</a>]

                been dictated by the characterization of “digital natives,”
                drawing from Mark Prensky’s influential 2001 article, “Digital
                    natives, digital immigrants”
                [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#prensky2001">Prensky 2001</a>]. Digital natives and digital immigrants are the two
                archetypes often used to represent the purported gap in technical proficiency
                between younger people who have grown up with “the digital language of computers, videogames and the
                        Internet,”
                     [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#prensky2001">Prensky 2001</a>, 6] and older people, who are moving into digital technology from an analog
                world. Many in higher education seem to have internalized the idea of digital
                natives, and presume that students have the inherent ability and tools to work
                critically and develop digital content [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#bennett2011">Bennett and Maton 2011</a>]. The digital
                native/digital immigrant concept has been well-criticized for taking a homogenous
                view of the generation, ignoring digital divides based on location, race, and
                income, as well as disparities that encourage young boys to learn technology at a
                higher rate than young girls [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#brake2014">Brake 2014</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#hargittai2008">Hargittai and Walejko 2008</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#thomas2011">Thomas 2011</a>]. Despite the clear problems with the concept of digital
                natives, the presumption that young people as a whole are well versed in digital
                media and communication remains strong in classrooms and curriculum development
                committees [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#langan2016">Langan et al. 2016</a>]

            <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Implicit in the rhetoric of the digital native is the notion that students are
                skilled in both the use and creation of digital content. This ranges from the
                scientific — studies do show that the majority of young people are using, creating,
                and publishing digital content — to the anecdotal — teachers, parents, and
                professors alike have stories about how their students or children have had to
                assist them with new technologies. Though many in higher education generalize their
                undergraduate students as being well acquainted with technology and approach their
                studies through a digital lens, students often struggle when it comes to critical
                content creation and mediation. The characterization of undergraduates as
                    “digital natives” ignores the significant portion of students
                who are from an older generation, as well as students whose families and schools
                were not able to afford these devices. Even for students who have grown up with
                digital devices and can fairly easily adapt to digital interfaces, they have most
                often grown up as <em class="term">consumers</em> of digital media and commercialized sharing
                services. Students are often much less adept at creating content that is not tightly
                mediated by some kind of commercial service with restrictions on form (e.g.
                Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook). Commercial services limit the form and functionality
                (though not necessarily the creativity) of content created to advocate for social or
                political change, analysis, information, art and entertainment, or commercial
                interests, and create a greater divide between those who can freely communicate in
                digital forms, and those who can communicate only through limited form.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">There should be reason for concern that students are often taking part in digital
                information and media transmission, but are not currently trained in the literacies
                and affordances of the technology they use. For the most part, content creation and
                sharing involves proprietary software or services that heavily mediate creation.
                This means that some “tech skills” often come through narrow
                technology that limits potential outcomes and often monetizes user-created content —
                platforms and software such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YikYak, PowerPoint, and
                Facebook create a rigid form for content, and make simple interfaces for creation
                and publication. While this is greatly beneficial in that it provides a low bar, it
                means that users become skilled at using a particular tool, not in the theoretical
                or technical principles, or even potential options. Tool-based literacy limits
                sustainability, cross-platform work, and understanding of the impact of media upon
                the message. Critical evaluation of digital media and the means to produce them is
                valuable for both consumption and production of digital media and information. The
                integration of digital skills in the liberal arts course is an opportunity to
                promote the continued strength of a skilled, literate, critical culture. Ideally,
                digital content creation and publication should be done using free and open source
                means, or at least software that is widely used and amenable to multiple sources of
                distribution. This allows users to continue their creative, civic, and personal
                communication or media production with platform and service agnostic tools, and a
                better understanding of production.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Consider the following example: If a person wished to promote a social justice group,
                she may do so easily using platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat. She could
                develop a Facebook page with a text description and distribute photos, video, and
                calls to action via all three platforms. However, she is forced to adhere to limits
                of each platform, such as design constraints, inability to use custom HTML/CSS, and
                size and space constraints. She may also be forced to pay to promote content for
                others to see her group’s media. Furthermore, she is subject to the limits of the
                platforms’ terms of use. Should she experience harassment or misbehavior on these
                platforms, she will likely be powerless to prevent it. On Facebook, for example, she
                is required to use her full legal name (and would be required to provide legal
                documentation if challenged). Meanwhile, the content she produces is monetized by
                the platform on which she publishes. If, on the other hand, she were skilled at
                creating media, she would be able to create a standalone website to host media in
                whatever size and form she desires; she would have freedom to style and hyperlink
                any text, and she (and her organization) retains sole rights to the use and reuse of
                their content. Once content is produced to the website, social media platforms may
                be leveraged to generate site traffic.</div>

                    substantial growth [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#hirsch2012">Hirsch 2012</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#thomas2014">Thomas and Lorang 2014</a>]. An increasing number of universities are offering
                    minors, majors, and specializations in Digital Humanities and similar fields,
                    and still more are including digital project development and critique of
                    existing digital projects in coursework. Rather than continuing to produce
                    students who are unfamiliar with many of the common communication, analysis, and
                    research methods of the modern day, this framework seeks to apply a liberal arts
                    rationale for the development of critical analysis and development of web
                    interaction and writing, multimodal projects, data analysis and visualization,
                    and large-scale analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="locke-digital.html#d37466e301">[2]</a> These skills all have parallels in liberal

                    persuasive writing, critical analysis of arguments, and techniques for research
                    and information source analysis. If instructors are not familiar enough with
                    these technologies to teach them themselves, partnerships with digital
                    humanities specialists, librarians, or instructional designers can be

                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Founded in August of 2014, LEADR is both a physical space and a curriculum
                    development initiative developed as a collaboration between the Department of
                    History, the Department of Anthropology, and Matrix: The Center for Digital
                    Humanities and Social Science at Michigan State University, a large public
                    research university in the United States. LEADR emerged out of feeling that
                    students needed to engage more critically with the digital materials and
                    techniques that faculty were using for their own research. The space itself was
                    designed to facilitate collaboration and openness in a decentralized learning
                    space. Nearly all of the furniture is movable, facilitating shifts between
                    seminar-style arrangement and group project work, in addition to decentralized
                    poster-like presentation spaces. LEADR is also fully equipped with large screens
                    for group work, machines, cameras, audio and light kits, 3D printers, micro
                    computing equipment, and other technology to facilitate innovative digital work.
                    The LEADR staff, comprised of two full-time academic staff members and three PhD
                    students from the History and Anthropology departments, assist faculty with the
                    development of assignments, develop and teach digitally-focused instruction and
                    discussion sessions, provide assistance in developing grading guidelines, and
                    staff the lab space, which is open nearly fifty hours per week.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">LEADR works with courses at all levels (graduate as well as undergraduate) and
                    across a number of departments, programs, and colleges. Faculty in History and
                    Anthropology teach the vast majority of courses, but these courses can be listed
                    as History, Anthropology, Integrated Social Science, residential colleges, or
                    other programs. Although some courses are specifically developed as Digital
                    History or Digital Humanities courses, most courses visit the lab a few times
                    per semester, often with at least one visit aimed solely at a flipped
                    classroom-style work session, where students read or watch content ahead of time
                    and complete activities or project work in the classroom. The LEADR component
                    for these courses is similar to the use of labs in many science courses – it is
                    an opportunity for students to take the content and methods that they have read
                    and discussed and apply them in hands-on experiences where they can build,
                    experiment, and play, and then reflect on their experiences.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">For our students entering the fields of History, Anthropology, or related fields
                    as graduate students, researchers, or careers in libraries, galleries, or
                    museums, the benefits of digital humanities skills may be fairly apparent. These
                    skills enable them to engage with emerging work and to produce their own
                    research, projects, or critiques capable of making public and scholarly impact.
                    However, for students taking these courses as non-majors fulfilling degree
                    requirements, the benefits may be less obvious, especially to the students
                    themselves. For these reasons, it is important to break down the skills,
                    methodologies, and literacies that comprise or could comprise digital humanities
                    coursework, and to subsequently focus on these skills when creating digital
                    curricula and adding digital activities and assignments to existing courses.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Rather than teaching “Digital Humanities,” we began thinking
                    about project building as an entryway to teaching essential liberal arts skills
                    using new media and web publishing, and visualization and analysis tools. There
                    are many great reasons to incorporate digital project creation into courses —
                    students build technical skills, create scholarship that is accessible to
                    others, approach their research objects in new and dynamic ways, collaborate and
                    develop project management skills, learn emerging methods of knowledge,
                    production, and build their portfolio. If constructed thoughtfully, the
                    literacies, hard skills, and soft skills that go into digital humanities work
                    can contribute both directly to the growth of knowledge and capabilities within
                    students’ own disciplines. They can also contribute more generalizable skills
                    that can be understood as digital extensions of long-standing liberal arts
                    skills that History, Anthropology, and other disciplines have long imparted to
                    students, such as writing, evaluation, critical thinking, and synthesis. The
                    ability to break these down and understand them as teaching liberal arts in the
                    digital age allows for more clarity in the development of assignments, and it is
                    also a useful way to encourage instructors to integrate these projects and
                    activities into their classrooms. </div>

                        digital primary sources, including digital collections and narrative-driven

                        illustrate central concepts in writing to creating exhibits that draw upon
                        large collections of digitized documents, artifacts, and photographs.
                        Because primary source discovery and evaluation is a critical component of
                        nearly all projects, information literacy instruction in conjunction with

                        information or with questionable provenance. Although studies have shown
                        that students do usually end up in library journal databases when seeking
                        reliable or scholarly sources, based on experiences in the LEADR classroom,
                        students rarely think about similar repositories for accessing primary

                        directly to Google Image Search when asked to find a historic photograph to
                        use as a source. To alleviate this problem, students are introduced to
                        librarians early on, and have a session on finding and working with primary
                        source material whenever relevant. In addition to learning about available
                        resources through library databases, students are shown local collections in
                        the MSU Museum or the MSU Library Special Collections. This gives students
                        the additional benefit of meeting and speaking with the curators and
                        librarians who possess relevant expertise about the collections, and
                        students are strongly encouraged to visit the locations and conduct more

                                they are used in scholarship. The first component of this lesson
                                required students to familiarize themselves with specific library

                        play a key role, as undergraduate students are not nearly as digitally
                        literate as often assumed [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#ala">ALA 2013</a>, 5–17]. “Generally, neither children nor adults acquire

                        increasingly make data open in the name of transparency. Without the skills
                        to access and evaluate data, there can be great hurdles to successfully use
                        and analyze these resources as scholars, citizens, and employees.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">The use of this framework over the past academic year has led to a number of
                    changes in the ways courses are conceptualized, structured, and taught. On the
                    whole, these changes have contributed to more course partnerships, to more
                    immersive and engaged assignments and activities, evaluation that focuses on
                    literacies and reflection more than final product, and, in the end, more
                    undergraduate students who are equipped with technical and critical thinking
                    skillsets for engagement in digital environments on and off campus. On the
                    administrative level, the framework has enabled these improvements in several
                    ways:</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">First, it moves the assignment focus away from the deliverable and back into the
                    process and the praxis. There are a number of tools that offer sleek final
                    interfaces, but little in the way of customization, and limit the actual
                    learning about publication, research methods, and the technology behind them.
                    The domain, method, and technical objectives should be considered first, with
                    the process and expectations can be determined accordingly. It can be tempting
                    to formulate learning objectives and then jump to the simplest solution to
                    produce a deliverable, abandoning or partially conceding learning objectives in
                    the process. The framework helps us keep these in mind, and also informs grading
                    rubrics that value the demonstration of methods and skills over a shortcut to a
                    presentable deliverable.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">Second, this framework is helpful in engaging people who are new to digital
                    research, or even those who are skeptical of its values. Some humanists may be
                    dismissive of digital projects because of the presumption that they are flashy
                    but lacking in substance, while others may be intimidated by the technical work
                    required to make a digital project function effectively. The framework makes it
                    much easier to move beyond conversations that focus too much on the output or
                    the technology and instead focus on the learning that occurs throughout project
                    development. This type of reframing may be obvious to many immersed in digital
                    humanities, but can go a long way toward making digital methods more
                    interesting, valuable, and approachable for those who are new to the field.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">Douglas Rushkoff, a Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics, delivered an
                    oft-cited talk at the 2010 South by Southwest Festival proclaiming that citizens
                    in the imminent future must “program or be programmed”
                         [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#rushkoff2010">Rushkoff 2010</a>]. In his book, which gets its title from this proclamation, he wrote of
                    his typical response when people ask him if they really do need to learn to
                    program: <blockquote><p>
                        And while I always answer, “Yes, you do have to learn
                                to program,” the real answer is probably no. You don’t. You can
                            get by without becoming a literate participant of the digital age. You
                            may not know what’s going on, you may not have much of an impact on the
                            future of our species, and you may begin to feel like technology knows
                            more about you than you know about it-but no, you don’t have to learn to
                            program.
                         [<a class="ref" href="locke-digital.html#rushkoff2011">Rushkoff and Purvis 2011</a>, 7–8]
                    </p></blockquote> While Rushkoff’s response may be a bit facetious, his larger point,
                    articulated throughout his book, is that digital media and technologies are full
                    of decisions made by people, and those decisions have an impact on the everyday
                    lives of others. Without an understanding of how technology works — even a
                    surface level understanding — an individual has reduced agency in their everyday
                    lives. It is the duty of liberal arts educators to ensure that students retain
                    this agency, at least in the ways that they experience media, think critically,
                    and communicate on personal and societal levels.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">It is my hope that the framework articulated here will facilitate and aid others
                    to include these crucial skills into their teaching, in much the same way they
                    have long facilitated skill-building and discussion of things like writing,
                    evaluating evidence, and critical thinking. Digital humanities provide an
                    opportunity to integrate the disciplinary study of literature, historical
                    primary sources, and archaeological discoveries with these skills and knowledges
                    for the twenty-first century. The framework here also provides an approach that
                    enables instructors to focus on the core learning outcomes without gravitating
                    towards an easier or more attractive deliverable.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="locke-digital.html#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">Although the framework was developed within a digital research-oriented lab, the
                    framework can be useful for collaborations between disciplinary faculty,
                    librarians, educational technologists, instructional designers, or graduate
                    students. Educators in the liberal arts must continue to grapple with emerging
                    forms of communication and analysis, or we risk leaving our students lacking in
                    critical areas of the liberal arts. Media and information literacies and
                    multimodal and digital writing skills are essential for effective communication
                    and civic engagement now and in the future, and liberal arts courses must engage
                    with them. This flexible and extensible framework offers one fruitful route, by
                    developing digital humanities projects intended to impart such skills while
                    engaging with domain-specific content.</div>

                    Ryan Cordell has reflected on his experiences with students who find little
                    interest or appeal in “Digital Humanities.” William
                    Pannapacker has argued for the usage of the term “digital liberal
                        arts,” particularly at liberal arts colleges because it is much
                    more inclusive, approachable, and less politicized than digital humanities. For

                        describe the disciplines that are intended to teach broad sets of skills
                        such as writing and communication, social awareness and responsibility,
                        critical thinking, and analytical and problem-solving skills. The
                        terminology comes from the charge that these skills and subjects are
                        essential for all free individuals to take part in civic society. While
                        there is clear overlap with the US model of liberal arts colleges, the term
                        is intended to fit into much broader contexts in humanities, social science,
