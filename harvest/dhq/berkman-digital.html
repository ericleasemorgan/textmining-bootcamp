                <p>The formally constrained work of the Oulipo (l’Ouvroir de Littérature
                    Potentielle, loosely translated as Workshop of Potential Literature) lends
                    itself particularly well to digital studies, which was quickly recognized by the
                    members of the group. To facilitate its goal of avoiding chance in its literary
                    production, the group was naturally drawn to the determinism of computers, where
                    true chance is simply impossible. In its early years, therefore, the group used
                    algorithmic procedures as a starting point for various texts and also attempted
                    to program these texts on actual computers, creating some of the first
                    electronic literature and embarking on proto-digital humanities work as early as
                    the 1960s and 1970s, later abandoning these efforts and relegating all
                    subsequent activity to a subsidiary group.</p>
                <p>To understand the Oulipo's forays into computer science and more importantly, why
                    they abandoned them, I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of
                    the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities. The goal was twofold: first,
                    through exploratory programming, I intended to create interactive, digital
                    annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation; more importantly, I hoped that by
                    attempting to reproduce the Oulipo's own algorithmic efforts, I would gain
                    similar insights into the nature of “Potential Literature” and be able to
                    understand why the group abandoned such efforts after the 1970s.</p>
                <p>This article describes the content, development, and results of my project. For
                    each of my three Python-based annexes, I offer a historical survey of the
                    Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the Oulipo’s own proto-digital
                    humanities experiments; then, I will talk about my own experiences as a
                    coder-researcher, what learning Python has brought to my project, and how my
                    exploratory programming offered me a new kind of critical reflection.
                    Establishing these annexes forced me to learn to code, a type of work that does
                    not only produce digital texts, but also helped me to reflect on the notion of
                    chance in a more nuanced way. Finally, coding has allowed me to better
                    understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital
                    experimentation. </p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle (OuLiPo, loosely translated into English
                    as the Workshop for Potential Literature), an experimental writing group founded
                    in Paris in 1960, attempts to apply mathematical procedures to literature,
                    inventing procedures (known as <span class="hi italic">constraints</span>) to follow
                    during the composition of a text. One of the main goals of this strategy is to
                    reduce the role of chance, and it is therefore unsurprising that computers were
                    one of the first items on its early agenda. Computers are utterly incompatible
                    with the notion of chance, and in theory should have been a perfect, and rather
                    timely solution. Indeed, the founding of the Oulipo coincided with a critical
                    stage in the development of computers, and the group took full advantage
                    thereof, programming their texts and procedures through partnerships with Bull
                    Computers and the Centre Pompidou. Early computing put one in much closer
                    contact with the basic fabric of coding and the members quickly learned that
                    writing code requires one to divide a problem into its simplest, logical
                    components, very much like the elementary procedures they were inventing in the
                    group's formative years. However, by the 1970s, the group abandoned such
                    efforts, relegating all future algorithmic experimentation to a subsidiary. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In recent years, the field of digital humanities has been gaining popularity.
                    While far from nascent (the origins can be dated back to as early as the 1940s),
                    the discipline has failed to define itself, often preferring a broad scope that
                    situates its activity at the intersection of computing, technology, and
                    humanities scholarship. In theory, this sort of vague definition could be seen
                    as beneficial, encompassing a wide range of tools and techniques that can be
                    applied to humanistic work. In practice, while a great variety of scholarship
                    has been and is currently being undertaken that claims to use digital humanities
                    practices, a majority of this work seems to fall under the categories of textual
                    encoding, the creation of digital archives, and the use of ready-made tools to
                    run some type of analysis on a digital text or visualize data from it. The fact
                    that digital humanists do not seem to prioritize learning to program has been
                    lamented on several occasions by Nick Montfort, both in his own treatise on
                    exploratory programming for humanistic inquiry [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#montfort2016">Montfort 2016</a>] and
                    also in <cite class="title italic">A New Companion to Digital Humanities</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#montfort2015">Montfort 2015</a>]. While not widespread, a knowledge of computing
                    languages and algorithmic procedures can indeed be productive in humanistic
                    research, as the Oulipo demonstrates through its aforementioned computer efforts
                    as well as through its non-algorithmic productions, which given the highly
                    intentional compositional methods, lend themselves well to computational methods
                    of inquiry. The Oulipo is not only a particularly good example of raw material
                    to be analyzed using digital methods, but is also present in many canonical
                    digital humanities criticisms, one of the best examples being Stephen Ramsay’s
                        <cite class="title italic">Reading Machines</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#ramsay2011">Ramsay 2011</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">However, the goal of this article is not to give a critical overview of the use
                    of Oulipo studies for digital humanities. It is rather to demonstrate how I was
                    able to use exploratory programming to understand the Oulipo's forays into
                    computer science and more importantly, why the group abandoned such initiatives.
                    To this end, I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of the
                    Princeton Center for Digital Humanities under the guidance of Cliff
                        Wulfman<a class="noteRef" href="berkman-digital.html#d10e197">[1]</a> as my technical lead. My project had two
                    main goals: first, through exploratory programming, I intended to create
                    interactive, digital annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation; more
                    importantly, I hoped that by attempting to reproduce the Oulipo's own
                    algorithmic efforts, I would gain similar insights into the nature of
                        “Potential Literature” and be able to understand why the group
                    abandoned such efforts. My original intention was to create five digital annexes
                    (of which I only completed three that would constitute the final product)<a class="noteRef" href="berkman-digital.html#d10e203">[2]</a>, each one to accompany a chapter in my dissertation. The
                    purpose and development of these annexes were intertwined: my preliminary
                    research on the Oulipo's computer efforts enriched my own understanding of the
                    task at hand; by learning to program, I was afforded a rare glimpse into the
                    mindset of the early Oulipo; finally, by manipulating the finished product, my
                    reader would better understand the underlying mathematical principles at work in
                    these texts.</div>

                    understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital
                    experimentation. Carrying out a digital humanities project on the Oulipo —
                    itself a quasi-academic research group that both analyzes and creates — resulted
                    in a hybrid experiment with multiple, varied results and insights, which helped

                    Paul Braffort (a computer scientist and member of the second generation of

                            the manipulation of the strips on which each verse is printed is
                            sometimes delicate”

                    design of the collection is visually compelling and provides a more intuitive
                    understanding of the combinatorics that regulate the volume. However, certain
                    manipulations of the set of poems are cumbersome, for instance reading Queneau’s
                    original ten sonnets. In order for the computer to facilitate the reading
                    process, the A.R.T.A. program makes a selection from Queneau’s original ten
                    sonnets based on the length of the reader’s name and the time it takes the
                    reader to type it. This generates a “magic number” of
                    fourteen digits, each of which determines from which of the original ten sonnets
                    the corresponding verse is taken [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#oulipo1981">Oulipo Atlas</a>, 299]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">This method responds to the Oulipo’s earlier question about Starynkevitch’s
                    program regarding the method of choosing the verses. However, this new program
                    is still surprisingly restrictive. Mark Wolff acknowledges that this program has
                    more “potential” in the Oulipian sense than the one
                    produced with the help of Starynkevitch: “Such a program has no potential in the Oulipian sense
                            because random numbers produce aleatory effects. The original algorithm
                            preserves an active role for the user, even if that role requires the
                            minimal engagement of typing one's name in order to sustain the creative
                            process”
                         [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#wolff2007">Wolff 2007</a>, 6]. However, with the physical edition, the reader has the freedom to read
                    in different ways. This program, on the other hand, only produces a single poem
                    using a method that is never explicitly stated. While a reader could type
                    his/her name multiple times to produce new poetry to read, this is a
                    fundamentally less interesting task than manipulating the physical volume, where
                    the reader has more autonomy. Herein lies one of the great difficulties that I
                    would soon face in carrying out my project: since the active selection of poems
                    is what creates the illusion that the reader becomes the author, having a
                    computer replace the manipulation of verses deprives the reader of the pleasure
                    and creativity he or she would experience with the physical volume. </div>

                        to a computer program, I needed to rewrite them as an <span class="hi italic">array</span> of <span class="hi italic">arrays</span>: ten sonnets of fourteen
                        lines each. Once I had this data structure, I had to learn to write programs

                        upon that to design a program that would generate a pseudo-random sonnet
                        from a 14-character key (the digits of this key would each be between 0 and
                        9, indicating which of the original 10 sonnets to take the verse from).
                        Finally came the creative part: I had to decide how to produce
                            <em class="emph">pseudo-random</em> sonnets in a way that would remain faithful
                        to the Oulipian notion of <span class="hi italic">chance</span>. In the end, I came
                        up with three different ways<a class="noteRef" href="berkman-digital.html#d10e499">[9]</a>: </div>
                    <div class="ptext"><ol class="list"><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">Age:</span> The reader inputs his/her birthday and the
                            program uses the digits in the birthday to generate the key. The
                            calculations I subject the digits of the birthday to in order to produce
                            the key are invisible to the reader, and have nothing to do with the
                            reader’s age. My next goal is therefore to tweak it to calculate exactly
                            how old the reader is at the time the poem is generated so that every
                            minute the reader generates a poem, that poem is different from the
                            previous. </li><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">Location:</span> The reader is directed to a website
                            which gives him/her a latitude and longitude value which he/she then
                            inputs into my program. These numbers are then manipulated to create the
                            14-digit code to generate a sonnet. In this way, the reader can generate
                            sonnets from not only his or her current location, but any location. The
                            implications of this type of pseudo-random poem are certainly in the
                            spirit of the Oulipo, but once again, the actual calculations to which I
                            subject the data to generate a 14-digit string seems too divorced from
                            the method to be considered truly Oulipian. </li><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">UUID:</span> A UUID is generated from the user’s

                            on the time. </li></ol></div>

                        process. The only person who had any fun in this is me. That said, perhaps
                            <em class="emph">programming</em> this programmatic text is one viable way to
                        read it. Queneau claims at the outset that his little poetry volume is
                        utterly impossible to read in a human lifetime, but also claims that
                            <em class="emph">only</em> a computer can appreciate poems generated in this way.
                        Clearly, to have any chance at “reading” the volume, one
                        must read it as a machine. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Through programming, I have gained a more thorough understanding of this text
                        and its implications, but I also understand how Queneau’s choice of
                        extremely specific subject matter for each of his original poems is the key
                        factor in the hilarity of the potential poems. Each verse of Queneau’s
                        original poems is essentially <em class="emph">tagged</em> with vocabulary linking it
                        to its specific subject. A verse from the first poem that is imbued with an
                        Argentinian vocabulary, for instance, cannot possibly be interchanged with a
                        verse about the leaning tower of Pisa without producing a destabilizing
                        effect. And while certain combinations of these verses may indeed be funnier
                        than others or produce unexpected effects, it is precisely the content of
                        the original poems (that is to say, what would be invisible to a computer
                        reading the text) that produces the surrealist effect of reading the
                        potential poems. While my methods for generating pseudo-random poetry given
                        Queneau’s originals may not be satisfying, I can use my program to analyze
                        the text further. I have even adapted my program, replacing Queneau’s poems
                        with Shakespearean sonnets that all have more or less the same theme. The
                        resulting combinations are far less jarring than Queneau's original,
                        precisely due to the lack of specific, tagging vocabulary. </div>

                        combinatorial poetry. Poetry, as the Oulipo was well aware, by its fixed
                        forms and propensity for patterns, can be inherently combinatorial. The
                        Oulipo was not the first in noting this property — the Grands Rhétoriqueurs,
                        for instance, were writing similarly expandable poetry as early as the
                        fifteenth century (Jean Molinet's <cite class="title">Sept rondeaux sur un
                            rondeau</cite>
                        [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#molinet1999">Molinet 1999</a>] is an excellent example). Furthermore, the
                        Oulipo's work has inspired countless other examples of combinatorial poetry
                        generators that can be adapted as I have and subjected to statistical
                        analysis. Computers can help a digital humanist when faced with a volume of
                        combinatorial poetry of which the time to read exceeds a human lifetime,
                        allowing for a mathematical type of “distant reading” that is better
                        equipped to explicate such computer-inspired poetry. </div>

                        number of ways, this particular one (created by Queneau) is particularly
                        aesthetic considering the choices he makes: the nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 21
                        frame the rest, as these determine only expository elements, but not the
                        action of the story; node 20 and not its double, 21 (both of which terminate
                        the program) seems to be Queneau's preferred ending judging from its place
                        within the graph, and not outside the story; in short, Queneau's artistic
                        choices speak volumes about Queneau's own interpretation of his text. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Queneau’s story initially gives this reader a choice between the story of
                        three little peas, three big skinny beanpoles, or three average mediocre
                        bushes. The choices are all binary, and mostly stark oppositions. For
                        instance, either the reader chooses to read the tale of the three peas or he
                        or she does not. Should the reader prefer not to read this first option, he
                        or she will find that the two alternatives offer meager results. Refusing
                        all three terminates the program almost immediately. If the reader chooses
                        the proper beginning and advances in the tale, the first few choices of the
                        story allow the reader to have a say in descriptive aspects of the story —
                        whether or not the peas dream, what color gloves they wear as they sleep in
                        their pod, and whether or not they roll around on a highway first. In many
                        cases, pointless alternatives are either offered to the reader in an effort
                        to convince him or her of his or her autonomy (the alternative descriptions)
                        or as unsatisfying dead ends (the false beginnings). Regardless of the path
                        the reader takes, there is only one “real” story. There
                        are even two choices that are not choices at all: node 13 asks the reader if
                        he or she wishes to know since when the one little pea has been analyzing
                        dreams, but the alternative takes the reader to the same node, since the
                        answer will not be provided in any case [<a class="ref" href="berkman-digital.html#queneau1973">CAVF</a>, 279]. The following node similarly promises the analysis of the dream, but the
                        alternative proposition affirms that: “If not, go to 15 anyway, because you won’t see
                                anything”

                        follows: “First, the computer ‘dialogues’
                                with the reader by proposing the different choices, then edits and

                        (network) visualization project that is freely available for Python. Given
                        my background in mathematics and my research on <span class="hi italic">graph
                            theory</span>, I felt immediately at ease with the way this program
                        operates. In <span class="hi italic">graph theory</span>, a <span class="hi italic">graph</span> is defined as a plot of nodes and edges. In graphviz as
                        well, in order to make a <span class="hi italic">graph</span>, I had to define all
                        requisite nodes and edges. The program then generates a visualization of the
                        graph that is spatially efficient. As an exercise, I made a <span class="hi italic">graph</span> of the famous <span class="hi italic">graph
                            theory</span> problem of the <cite class="title">Bridges of Königsberg</cite><a class="noteRef" href="berkman-digital.html#d10e745">[14]</a>.</div>

                        Still not enough, I aimed to integrate the two programs, and Cliff and I
                        decided to give my original program the structure of a <span class="hi italic">graph</span> so that it would be able to generate a graph with graphviz
                        at the end. My program now has nodes and edges that correspond with
                        Queneau’s prompts and choices. With this structure, I was able to write a
                        program that enters the <span class="hi italic">graph</span> at the first node and,
                        depending on the choice of the user, proceeds through the story, printing
                        out the selected nodes and the corresponding edges. The program records the
                        path the reader takes and at the end, prints out a <span class="hi italic">graph</span> with the reader’s path filled in green, to represent the
                        little peas. While my little program does not take into account the full
                        potential of the intersection of <span class="hi italic">graph theory</span> and
                        literature as proposed by Queneau’s text, I am very pleased with how it
                        functions. For instance, I can leave to the reader the mathematical exercise
                        of finding the minimum number of read-throughs required to hit every node.
                        While there is still more that can be done, the graph my program generates
                        is itself informative — side by side with the text, the reader can learn
                        more about the potential of this three little peas story. </div>

                        structure of Queneau's tale. This representation of the graph clearly
                        demonstrates that there is only one “true” story, with a
                        few minor diversions that do not change the final outcome. The left-hand
                        side of the graph (nodes 2, 3, and so on) demonstrates a refusal to read the

                        confirm many criticisms of digital humanities scholarship. If reading the
                        text is unnecessary to its interpretation, then is this not an abject
                        refusal of traditional humanities work? I would argue that this method does
                        not necessarily supersede a traditional close reading, but rather provides a
                        legible visualization of the potential of similar graph theoretical texts.
                        Any choose-your-own-adventure story is composed of nodes and edges which can
                        be programmed — as I have done — using graphviz. Indeed, my program can be
                        adapted very easily to create an interactive edition and graph of any such
                        story. I would encourage digital humanists who wish to try their hand at
                        exploratory programming to apply this method to more complex works of which
                        a traditional close reading might be obscured by the number of nodes and

                        it enjoys a privileged position as one of the group’s first official

                        that comes seven entries later in a dictionary of the author’s choosing.
                        Early Oulipian publications such as the first collected volume, <cite class="title italic">La Littérature Potentielle</cite>, experimented with many

                        in the context of their collaboration with Starynkevitch. In January 1963,
                        Dmitri Starynkevitch was an invited guest at a meeting. Lescure insisted
                        that he make a program for producing <span class="hi italic">S+7</span>’s on the CAB
                        500, and Starynkevitch spoke of the difficulties that arise when programming
                            <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> given the lack of a dictionary. For a human
                        author, applying the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> method is tedious. For a
                        computer of the 1960’s, it was virtually impossible. Starynkevitch explains
                        such difficulties: <blockquote><p>
                            All the difficulty obviously comes from the amount
                                of material you need — that is, to introduce into the machine. It is
                                currently possible for us to work with a few sonnets of pages of
                                text. (That is what we did for the <cite class="title italic">Cent mille
                                    milliards de poèmes</cite>.) But if we need to perforate an

                        meeting, Starynkevitch had programmed the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> method

                        found that God was particularly potential), Shakespeare, and Hugo. In
                        addressing these questions, Starynkevitch had to do a great deal of work by
                        hand. He first had to generate his own small dictionary of nouns (which he
                        chose at random, according to his letter), separate it into masculine and
                        feminine nouns, and then apply the procedure to both genders separately.
                        With issues of plural, he had to make corrections by hand, as well as with

                        First, while early computing was able to produce <span class="hi italic">S+7</span>’s, so much was done by hand that the Oulipo very quickly abandoned

                        point of automating a procedure if such an automation requires the creation
                        and perforation of a noun dictionary that has no other purpose?
                        Additionally, correcting gender discrepancies that the computer could not
                        understand was likely just as time-consuming as doing the entire thing by

                        was to provide the reader of my chapter 2 with a program to generate his/her
                        own <span class="hi italic">S+7</span>’s. In this way, when I claim that well-known
                        texts produce more comedic effects, the reader can generate an <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> of a well-known text and a lesser-known one in
                        order to enrich my analysis with more examples. I had also hoped that such a
                        program might be able to provide multiple dictionaries so that the reader
                        can experiment with the effect of different types of dictionaries on the
                        procedure and resulting texts. A final outcome was supposed to be the
                        ability to subtract 7 from previously written <span class="hi italic">S+7</span>’s,
                        allowing the reader to confirm whether or not an Oulipian had faithfully
                        produced an <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> without cheating. While my chapter 2
                        includes a diverse and varied selection of texts and procedures, only some
                        of which are substitution-based such as the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span>, my
                        annex would aim to provide one small, interactive example of the type of
                        potential literature the early Oulipo was examining. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Since my other annexes dealt exclusively with original texts written in
                        French (Queneau’s <cite class="title italic">Cent mille milliards de
                            poèmes</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Un conte à votre façon</cite>),
                        I programmed them using the original French texts, though I could have
                        easily provided a translated version. Given that the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> is a procedure, however, and that my dissertation committee
                        consists entirely of native English speakers, I allowed myself to circumvent
                        the difficulty of gendered nouns by designing my program in English rather
                        than in French. My next preliminary choice dealt with the texts I wanted to
                        provide to the reader. I chose a set of very canonical English writings:
                            <cite class="title italic">The Declaration of Independence</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Genesis</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Raven</cite>,
                            <cite class="title italic">A Tale of Two Cities</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Moby Dick</cite>. My final step was to decide which
                        excerpts of each text to include. I decided on the most recognizable parts
                        (generally the incipits) given what I explained above about the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> method. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="berkman-digital.html#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">This annex provided an excellent excuse to acquaint myself with <span class="hi italic">Natural Language Processing</span> using the NLTK’s textbook
                        and programs (<a href="https://enaming.com/exclusive/domain/nltk.com" onclick="window.open('https://enaming.com/exclusive/domain/nltk.com'); return false" class="ref">https://enaming.com/exclusive/domain/nltk.com</a>/). While I could
                        easily tag the nouns in my chosen texts manually, such laborious work would
                        inevitably produce the same dissatisfaction as early Oulipian computer
                        experiments with Starynkevitch. Nevertheless, my first step had to be to
                        create dictionaries of nouns using nltk. Theoretically, what Cliff and I
                        have envisioned allows the reader to produce dictionaries with specific
                        vocabularies which makes for more interesting S+7 variants. The first noun
                        dictionary I produced came from an online edition of Edgar Allan Poe’s
                        complete works. An <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> of the <cite class="title">Declaration of
                            Independence</cite> that uses a dictionary of Poe nouns to produce the
                        substitutions will not only be amusing in terms of diction, but will also
                        serve an analytic purpose. The <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> can be best
                        understood as a commentary on an original text rather than an original piece
                        of constrained writing. While applying this method to a pre-existing text
                        does indeed produce a new document immediately, the larger implications of
                        the method imply that any text is the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> of another.
                        In other words, all literature is potential. </div>

                        one. While I had initially included the <span class="hi italic">S+7</span> as a
                        basic example of an arithmetical Oulipian technique, I now see it as a first
                        attempt in a long line of Oulipian research on productive substitutions.
                        These valuable insights, while not necessarily unique to digital humanities
                        work, were facilitated and brought to light as a direct result of this
                        project. The collaborative nature of the project is one reason: discussions
                        with Cliff Wulfman who is not only a literary scholar, but also a computer
                        programmer, enabled both of us to understand this procedure simultaneously
                        as inspired by early computers and algorithmic methods. </div>

                        these efforts. The early Oulipo, inspired by the potential of computer
                        programming, demonstrated an algorithmic approach to literature in the early
                        constraints the members produced. My programming experiences helped me to
                        understand the essential difference between these types of algorithmic
                        procedures and the work that the group eventually settled on following the
                        members' dissatisfied responses to the computer experiments of the 1960s and
                        1970s, a clear preference for abstract mathematical thought — patterns and
                        structure — rather than the procedural tendencies of applied
                        mathematics.</div>

                        superficial method meant to produce one-off silly results. While in this

                        I do believe that future scholars can benefit from a greater understanding
                        of nltk in order to learn more about other algorithmic production that
                        coincided with the development of computational linguistics and early
                        humanities computing in the 1960s and 1970s. An understanding of nltk has
                        the additional benefit of promoting a certain kind of Oulipian creativity in

                    the experience. In a sense, the product was a pretext in order to take the idea
                    of the Oulipo and in a quasi-Oulipian fashion, think about formalizing it on
                    computers. From learning to program in Python (even though Python is not the
                    language early Oulipians used in their computer endeavors), I have gained a
                    greater understanding of early Oulipian techniques and why the Oulipo abandoned
                    computer programming relatively quickly and relegated this sort of activity to
                    the <cite class="title">ALAMO</cite>. I also have a greater appreciation for how exactly to
                    use digital humanities tools to explore new avenues in these texts that were
                    created with algorithmic procedures in mind. </div>

                    critically implemented, at least with regards to Oulipian work. Creating a
                    computer program of Queneau’s <cite class="title italic">Un conte à votre
                        façon</cite> alone is not necessarily a critical act, as it tends to
                    obscure the potential of the constraint from the user of the program. However,
                    using a computer to find more substantial intersections between the graphical
                    representation of <cite class="title italic">Un conte à votre façon</cite> and the
                    text itself is an Oulipian endeavor. Being an Oulipian reader means playing a
                    game set up by an Oulipian author, and they’re a clever bunch. If you don’t want
                    to be trapped forever in the labyrinth they created, then you need to think like
                    they do. For computer texts, that means learning to think like a computer, and

                        courses were always useful, his technical expertise was unmatched. But most
                        importantly, I have gained immeasurable insights from our conversations

                        I ultimately abandoned the idea of making an annex for my first chapter on
                        Set Theory, as none of the set theoretic constraints discussed in my chapter
                        would have been particularly engaging on a computer. Furthermore, the main
                        purpose of my first chapter was a historical analysis of the intellectual
                        inheritance of the mathematical field of set theory and not close readings
                        of Oulipian constraints. Additionally, in this paper I will not discuss my
                        fifth annex, which took the form of a Tinderbox hypertext, based on the

                            “The seven bridges of Königsberg” is a famous
                            historical problem in mathematics and simple introduction to the basics
                            of graph theory. Let us say you are a tourist in the Prussian city of
                            Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and want to see the whole city,
                            which is intersected by the Pregel River, containing two large islands.
                            Seven bridges connect these various positions: two leading from the left
                            bank to the first island, two more leading from the first island to the
                            right bank, one between the two islands, and one each between the second
                            island and each of the banks. Is it possible to devise a walk through
                            the city that crosses each bridge once and only once? Leonhard Euler
