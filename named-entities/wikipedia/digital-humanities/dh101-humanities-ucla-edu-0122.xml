JDrucker 9 2013 Digital humanities is work at the intersection of digital technology and humanities disciplines The term humanities was first used in the Renaissance by Italian scholars involved in the study and recovery of works of classical antiquity The term emphasizes the shift from a medieval theo centric world view to one in which man sic is the measure of all things The humanities are the disciplines that focus on the arts literature music dance theater architecture philosophy and other expressions of human culture But what does the adjective digital refer to And what are the implications of the term for work being done under this rubric Since all acts of digitization are acts of remediation understanding the identity of binary code digital file formats the migration of analogue materials and the character of born digital materials is essential to understanding digital environments Networked conditions of exchange play another role in the development of digital humanities and other digital projects Standards and practices established by communities form another crucial component of the technical infrastructure embodies cultural values Common myths about the digital environment are that it is stable even archival e g permanent and that it is immaterial e g not instantiated in analogue reality Every actual engagement with digital technology demonstrates the opposite While binary code underpins all digital activity at the level of electrical circuits the operation of digital environments depends on the ability of that code encode other symbolic systems In other words not code in itself as 1 s and 0 s but code in its capacity to encode instructions and information is what makes computation so powerful Computation is infinitely more powerful that calculation which is simple mathematics no matter how complex or sophisticate Computation involves the manipulation of symbols through their representation in binary code The possibilities are infinite The benefits of being able to encode information knowledge artifacts an other materials in digital format is always in tension with the liabilities the loss of information from an analogue object or in the case of a born digital artifact its fragility to migration and upgrade Activities a Assessment instrument please fill out terms you know and indicate those unfamiliar to you You do
