Text mining: Beyond the basics
==============================

This repository contains the narratives, corpus, and scripts for an [ELAG 2018 bootcamp called Text mining: Beyond the basics](https://www.elag2018.org/bootcamps/#text_mining). As such, the repository includes incarnations of the printed handout, a corpus of materials ranging in format (plain text, HTML, PDF), type (books, articles, Twitter feeds), and subject matter (literature, philosophy, news, computer science). It also contains the scripts & programs used to harvest the content, transform it into a corpus, extract information from it, and do evaluation against it. 

Text mining is a process of making implicit information explicit. It is a process enabling a reader to extract data from a corpus, give it context, turn it into information, make observations, and ultimately increase knowledge. Yes, really. Text mining does do this, but be forewarned. Text mining is not a replacement for traditional reading. It is a supplement and an enhancement to traditional reading. 

From the bootcamp description:

> Using freely available tools, it is possible to go beyond
> basic text mining, and instead, begin to read corpora at
> "scale". This bootcamp teaches how. At the end, participants
> will be able to:
> 
>   * identify patterns, anomalies, and trends in a corpus
>   * practice both "distant" and "scalable" reading
>   * enhance & complement their ability to do "close" reading
>   * use & understand any corpus of poetry or prose
> 
> Activities in the bootcamp include:
> 
>   * learning what text mining is, and why one should care
>   * creating a corpus
>   * creating a plain text version of a corpus
>   * creating simple word lists with a text editor
>   * creating advanced word lists with other tools
>   * cleaning & analyzing a corpus with OpenRefine
>   * charting & graphing a corpus with Tableau Public
>   * extracting named entities
>   * identifying topics and themes
>   * using a concordance to intelligently "read" a corpus
> 
> Anybody with sets of texts can benefit from this bootcamp.
> Any corpus of textual content is apropos: journal articles,
> books, the complete run of a magazine, blog postings,
> Tweets, press releases, conference proceedings, websites,
> poetry, etc. This bootcamp is operating system agnostic. All
> the software used in this workshop is freely available on
> the ‚Net, or it is already installed on one’s computer.
> Active participation requires zero programming, but students
> must bring their own computer, and they must know how to use
> a text editor such as NotePad++ or TextWrangler. WordPad nor
> TextEdit are sufficient.

'Hope to see you at ELAG 2018?
