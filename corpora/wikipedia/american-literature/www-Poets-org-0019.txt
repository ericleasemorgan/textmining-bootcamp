Academy of American Poets


The Academy of American Poets is the largest membership-based nonprofit organization fostering an appreciation for contemporary poetry and supporting American poets. For over three generations, the Academy has connected millions of people to great poetry through programs such as National Poetry Month, the largest literary celebration in the world; Poets.org, the Academy’s popular website; American Poets, a biannual literary journal; and an annual series of poetry readings and special events. Since its founding, the Academy has awarded more money to poets than any other organization.



 









“Poetry helps me to describe the ineffable, the seen and unseen, and the heartbreak of living. Poetry is a medium that is closest to our hearts and it can give voice to those who have been denied a voice.”



—Marilyn Chin, Academy of American Poets Chancellor (2018– )

About this Poem 
“Velimir Khlebnikov wrote somewhere that the State speaks to its people through its statues. Minsk is full of statues: gigantic statues to national poets along with the granite busts of communist officials. Maxim Bakhdanovich was a Belarusian modernist poet who died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-five, a couple of years after his first book was published. He was lucky to die so peacefully. In exactly twenty years most Belarusian intellectuals were tortured and murdered by the communist officials. In one night in 1937, Bolsheviks shot twenty-two young Belarusian writers. The statue of Bakhdanovich in Minsk is 4.6 meters high and is made out of granite.”
—Valzhyna Mort

                                                  Here, where I’m dying, in a white 
                                                 house by a blue harbor.
                                                        —Maxim Bakhdanovich

 
Come in, Maxim!... This is Minsk
choked under a pillow of clouds.
 
There’s you: a statue in a heavy coat.
Here all monuments wear coats
 
not wool, but linden bark coats
with bee fur collars.
 
In their pockets monuments keep belts.
And under collars monuments have necks.
 
In winter shadows insulate the walls.
Windows and cracks are plucked with shadows.
In museums on display are coats
 
and nooses. And water is pickle-juice.
 
Come in, Maxim, apartment blocks
are wrapped in ammunition staircases,
and window-medals sparkle through the night.
 
Every building here is a kind of bust,
an elevator ascends like vomit.
 
Of furniture there is a stump.
Come in, Maxim,
it’s nothing like lie dying by a harbor.
 
Take a sit on a stump.
Don’t cast a shadow.
Keep the coat on.

Poems for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month















poem

My Mama moved among the days 


My Mama moved among the days
like a dreamwalker in a field;
seemed like what she touched was hers
seemed like what touched her couldn’t hold,
she got us almost through the high grass
then seemed like she turned around and ran
right back in
right back on in

poem

Hours Days Years Unmoor Their Orbits


tonight I'm cleaning baby portobellos
for you, my young activist
wiping the dirty tops with a damp cloth
as carefully as I used to rinse raspberries
for you to adorn your fingertips
before eating each blood-red prize
these days you rarely look me in the eye
& your long shagged hair hides your smile

I don’t expect you to remember or
understand the many ways I’ve kept you
alive or the life my love for you
has made me live

poem

Things We Carry on the Sea


We carry tears in our eyes: good-bye father, good-bye mother
We carry soil in small bags: may home never fade in our hearts
We carry names, stories, memories of our villages, fields, boats
We carry scars from proxy wars of greed
We carry carnage of mining, droughts, floods, genocides
We carry dust of our families and neighbors incinerated in mushroom clouds

We carry our islands sinking under the sea
We carry our hands, feet, bones, hearts and best minds for a new life
We carry diplomas: medicine, engineer, nurse, education, math, poetry, even if they mean nothing to the other shore
We carry railroads, plantations, laundromats, bodegas, taco trucks, farms, factories, nursing homes, hospitals, schools, temples…built on our ancestors’ backs
We carry old homes along the spine, new dreams in our chests
We carry yesterday, today and tomorrow
We’re orphans of the wars forced upon us
We’re refugees of the sea rising from industrial wastes
And we carry our mother tongues
爱(ai)，حب  (hubb), ליבע (libe), amor, love

平安 (ping’an), سلام ( salaam), shalom, paz, peace 

希望（xi’wang), أمل (’amal), hofenung, esperanza, hope, hope, hope
As we drift…in our rubber boats…from shore…to shore…to shore…

How Alone Barbie Chang's Mother


How alone Barbie Chang’s mother
     must have felt doing
 
nothing but dying her mother actually
     stopped dying her hair
 
in January stopped being an actuary
     for her money she
 
must have known her time was limited
     did the diseased birch
 
tree know they were going to cut it down
     how quickly the air
 
around it filled in the space it does no
     good to know a mother’s
 
face who would have known that a 
     mother’s face could
 
be erased too at some point we are all
     eliminated from this
 
earth at some point most of us give birth
     at some point we lose
 
a mother at some point we are all
     disappointments who
 
can’t possibly care for others when
     our mothers die we
 
are all lost and there are no words for
     it some want to
 
name us as grieving others wrongly
     name us heroes

Duet


            Night time is the right time . . .
                  —Ray Charles and Margie Hendricks

She had me in the car. I came forward like a song.
We did it before temple, after temple, between prayers.
The windows echoed her mantras, our cries warmed the air.
Two peaks merged, then sank below the clouds.

We did it before temple, after temple, between prayers.
Her stomach began to show and people asked us not to come.
Two peaks merged, then sank below the clouds.
Night and day, everything was changing.

. . . . .

Her stomach began to show and people asked her not to come.
My mother was all alone when I was born.
Night and day. Everything was changing.
The radio started playing rhythm and blues.

My mother was all alone when I was born—
The windows echoed her mantras, our cries warmed the air,
The radio started playing rhythm and blues.
She had me in a car. I came forward like a song.
