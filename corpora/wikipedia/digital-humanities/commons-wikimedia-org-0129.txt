	Phrases in double quotes: For example, "holly dolly" returns very few results as opposed to holly dolly.
	Exclusion: Terms can be excluded with -, for example windows  -system (note there is no space between "-" and the excluded term).
	Wildcard search: Wildcards (symbols representing unknown text) can be prefixed and suffixed, for example, the search *stan will produce results like Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.
