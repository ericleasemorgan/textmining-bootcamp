                <p>The paper proposes to bridge two areas of inquiry, digital hermeneutics and
                    metaphor within a digital environment, by the analysis of a less studied
                    phenomenon, i.e. how interpretation is supported and shaped by metaphors
                    embedded in an interface. The study is articulated around three use cases for
                    literary, didactic and historical representations of imaginary and existing
                    cities based on a model (z-text) and interface (Z-editor) for zoomable texts. We
                    will try to demonstrate that the zooming and contextualization features of the
                    tool allow creating layers of meaning that can assist interpretation and
                    critical readings of literature and history.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="armaselu-metaphors.html#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">How can interpretations of text and images be supported and shaped by metaphors
                    embedded in an interface? This is the central question of our inquiry trying to
                    bridge digital hermeneutics and metaphor within a digital environment.
                    Interpretation is understood in terms of reconfiguration, reorganization,
                    restructuring of content, in a sense close to Samuels and McGann's
                        <em class="term">deformance</em> as “deformative critical operation”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#samuels1999">Samuels and McGann 1999</a>, 36] and Ramsay’s transformation or transduction “into an alternative vision”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#ramsay2008">Ramsay 2008</a>]. The aim is to foster insight on metaphor as a cognitive rather than
                    merely linguistic process and its interpretative incentives conveyed by means of
                    a digital tool. The model and interface proposed for examination
                        (<em class="term">z-text</em> and <em class="term">Z-editor</em>) encompass the metaphor of
                    zooming, permitting its users to work across scales and perspectives and
                    eventually encouraging them to make peculiar associations. All the presented use
                    cases, modeled via the Z-editor interface, involve cities–some imagined, some
                    planned, and some actually existing–as literary, historical, cultural, and
                    theoretical constructs. This choice is intended to illustrate how a digital tool
                    creates opportunities for undertaking layered investigations within disciplines
                    but also for engaging in cross-disciplinary exploration. Considering that
                    scholarship in Digital Humanities operates well from both sides, using
                    tool-making to advance theory and theory to imagine new tools, we combine a
                    practical perspective with theoretical reflection. An overview of works
                    originating from different fields, such as philosophy of science and
                    hermeneutics, cognitive linguistics, computer science and interface design,
                    serves as a starting point for our argument.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="armaselu-metaphors.html#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The assumption that digital technologies are shaping our perception and
                    understanding of the world has already been expressed in a variety of studies.
                    According to Capurro, these technologies have impact on all the “levels of our
                        being-in-the-world”, and it is by the term of <em class="term">digital
                        hermeneutics</em> that he defines the way “digital code is being
                        interpreted and implemented (or not)” in today’s society [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#capurro2010">Capurro 2010</a>]. Going beyond the traditional sense of text-centered
                    interpretation, Capurro aligns with Ihde’s concept of <em class="term">expanding</em> or
                        <em class="term">material hermeneutics</em> that considers technologies as
                    instruments through which “things can show themselves”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#ihde2003">Ihde 2003</a>], and which may therefore play an important role in the process of
                    producing knowledge. In the context of interactive art, Simanowski situates the
                    hermeneutic act at the intersection of formal analysis of a digital artifact
                    (structure, interface, grammar of interaction underpinned by the “hidden
                        text”, the code) and interpretation, in the sense of how these aspects “are perceived by the audience”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#simanowski2010">Simanowski 2010</a>]. Likewise, by their two-fold conception of digital hermeneutics, as
                    theory of interpretation and context for the development of applications
                    supporting interpretation, Akker et al. illustrate how the different types of
                    relationships (at the level of object, event, narrative), modeled within an
                    interface for online access to historical documents, may assist the user in the
                    interpretation of cultural heritage [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#akker2011">Akker et al 2011</a>]. Moreover,
                    Rockwell and Sinclair advocate for a digital hermeneutics with the focus on
                    computer-assisted text analysis and interpretation intended to the humanities
                        [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#rockwell2016">Rockwell and Sinclair 2016</a>]. Elaborating on Gualeni’s philosophical
                    approach to virtual worlds in video games [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#gualeni2015">Gualeni 2015</a>] and on
                    Ricoeur's theory of metaphor and narrative as reconfiguring human experience
                        [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#ricoeur1990">Ricoeur 1990</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#ricoeur2003">Ricoeur 2003</a>], Romele draws attention to the “reconfiguration
                    power” exerted by digital technologies on their users and to the “existential
                    and ontological consequences” of the “production and use” of these technologies,
                    articulated within the digital hermeneutics framework. [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#romele2016">Romele 2016</a>, 5–6]

                <div class="counter"><a href="armaselu-metaphors.html#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Initially considered a purely linguistic and aesthetic phenomenon, metaphor is
                    more and more studied in relation with cognitive processes, and implicitly
                    interpretation, mediated or not via computers. Advocating for an experientialist
                    approach within the broader context of a neural theory of language, Lakoff and
                    Johnson assume that metaphor is “one of the most basic mechanisms we have for
                            understanding our experience”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#lakoff2003">Lakoff and Johnson 2003</a>, 212], whose primary function is to provide a “partial understanding of one kind of experience in
                            terms of another”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#lakoff2003">Lakoff and Johnson 2003</a>, 155]. From an interactionist perspective, Indurkhya proposes a cognitive model
                    allowing to see metaphor as an unconventional description of an object or event
                        (<em class="term">target</em>) by means of a different set of concepts
                        (<em class="term">source</em>), which may involve the “reorganization and
                        restructuring” of the cognitive agent’s world view [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#indurkhya1992">Indurkhya 1992</a>, 245]. In Human Computer Interaction, metaphor
                    is often described as providing the user with “a model of the system”
                         [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#halskovmasden1996">Halskov Masden 1996</a>] or as a “device for explaining some system functionality or
                            structure by asserting its similarity to another concept or thing

                    the metaphor of zooming is enriched by an additional facet for perspective
                    change, represented by magnifying glasses and planes of different colors (right

                    critical readings of literature and history. The results of three use cases will
                    be discussed in which the Z-editor was used to explore cross-overs between text
                    and image and history and literature in descriptions of imaginary cities and
                    imaginary depictions of existing cities in order to establish their potential
                    role in the history of town planning. The choice for this topic of imaginary
                    cities in relation to town planning in literature and history makes possible to
                    assess the potential of models like z-text for the development of digital
                    hermeneutic methods. It also allows to use a wide array of texts and images,
                    reading interpretations of various authors and critics from various disciplines
                    and to compare theoretical reflections and practical applications. We claim that
                    digital tools should be used to widen the scope of literary and historical
                    analyses by combining multiple perspectives and not only focus on certain
                    patterns in one dimension. For instance, the historical research of town
                    planning in the digital era is still conditioned by morphological pattern
                    recognition tradition that goes back to 19th century “civic

                    instance Michael Conzen, Saverio Muratori, Lewis Mumford and Pierre Lavedan),
                    analyzes the spatial structure of towns by focusing on patterns of streets,
                    building blocks and lots. Some authors such as Gerard Eimer in his <cite class="title italic">Die Stadtplanung in schwedischen Ostseereich
                        (1600-1715)</cite>. <cite class="title italic">Mit Beiträgen zur Geschichte der

                    of their publications reveal to use the morphological approach to link the
                    structure of existing towns with mappings of ideal, imaginary cities. In this
                    morphological approach images and cartographical resources of imaginary, ideal
                    and of existing cities are often translated into grid or radio-concentric
                    diagrams for comparative analyses. These translations not seldom result in
                    reduction of complexity at the cost of understanding contextual differences
                    between these various images of cities. Such morphological readings of images
                    and cartographic sources (and their limitations) were enhanced by the
                    introduction of GIS in the history of town planning and architecture [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#koster2001">Koster 2001</a>]. However, GIS is only partially suitable for mapping
                    literary or historical landscapes. For instance, <cite class="title italic">The
                        Mapping Lake District Literature</cite> pilot of Lancaster University makes
                    possible to follow the trails of the authors Thomas Gray and Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge but the imaginary landscapes depicted in their epistolary journal and
                    letters cannot be plotted by geographical coordinates on the map. In his
                    exploration of the potential of spatial humanities, David Bodenhamer asks the
                    question: <blockquote><p>
                        how we as humanists make GIS do what is not intended to
                            do, namely, represent the world as culture and not simply mapped
                            locations?

                    </p></blockquote>Bodenhamer proposes to create “deep maps” that
                    contextualize GIS by combining them with multiple layers of multimedia artifacts
                    that can be viewed separately and collectively providing various perspectives.
                    Such multilayered multimedia objects would indeed permit to contextualize maps
                    represented by geographical coordinates with non-geographical, spatial
                    information. However, they do not allow to start from the other end, i.e. from
                    non-Euclidean, topical spaces for instance, such as the imaginary cities that
                    often inspired urban planners and architects. In this context the remarks of the
                    author, Italo Calvino (1923-1985), of our first use case <cite class="title italic">Le

                    1972 are of interest. Calvino considered his <cite class="title italic">Invisible
                        Cities</cite> relevant and actual for contemporary debates on town
                    planning: <blockquote><p>
                        I feel that the idea of the city which the book conjures
                            up is not outside time; there is also (at times implicit, at other
                            explicit) a discussion on the city in general. I have heard from a
                            number of friends in town planning that the book touches on some of the
                            questions that they are faced with in their work; and this is no
                            coincidence, as the background from which the book springs is the same
                            as theirs.

                    representations consisting of imaginary and existing cities, that we want to

                        case, the z-text model allows zooming on imaginary spaces in this framework

                            Sambit Panigrahi underlines the importance of “cities as strata that are perennially

                            Panigrahi compares Calvino’s description of the continuous city of
                            Leonia that each days breaches through its boundaries of deposited waste
                            at its circumference with Deleuze and Guattari’s explanation of a
                            multilayered stratum that deterritorializes from a center to periphery
                            through multiple states (epistrata) and the creation of new peripheral
                            centres with their peripheries (parastrata).</div>

                            zoom-out. According to Deleuze and Guattari, a rhizome is made of lines
                            of “segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions”, and lines
                            of “flight or deterritorialization as the maximum dimension after

                            divide. The first level of the representation (left) contains fragments
                            (z-lexias) mainly focusing on the concept of “new”

                            expressed by phrases such as “remains”,
                                “yesterday’s Leonia”,

                            both by critics and himself. Recently, Elio Baldi focused on Calvino’s
                            various roles in interactions between authors and critics by
                            occasionally looking through the lens of the writer and in other moments
                            through the eyes of the reader or editor [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#baldi2015">Baldi 2015</a>].
                            Indeed, lectures by Calvino and interviews with the author reveal many
                            shifts in perspectives on multiple planes. In a published lecture
                            dealing with the writing of Invisible Cities, Calvino reacts to
                                “almost all critics”, but also states “that the author’s view
                                no longer counts” and provides interpretations “as one reader
                                among others”

                            puts the <cite class="title italic">Invisible Cities</cite> into context by
                            referring to works that similarly are inspired by Marco Polo’s travels,
                            such as the poem <cite class="title italic">Kubla Kahn</cite> by Samuel
                            Taylor Coleridge [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#coleridge1798">Coleridge 1798</a>], <cite class="title italic">The Message from the Emperor</cite> by Franz Kafka of 1919 [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#kafka2012">Kafka 2012</a>], or <cite class="title italic">Il Deserto dei

                            indirect, for example when Calvino notes that the atlas of Kubla Kahn
                            contains images of “lands visited in thought, but not yet discovered or
                            founded: New Atlantis, Utopia, the City of the Sun” [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#calvino1997">Calvino 1997</a>, 147]. On a more detailed level the
                            possibility of sideways movements becomes important when Calvino reacts
                            to all those critics who underlined the importance of the closing
                            sentence by claiming that the <cite class="title italic">Invisible

                                “codes” highlighting the
                                “writability” and plurality of the text. As
                            Calvino observes: <blockquote><p>
                                And yet, all these pages put together did not
                                    make a book: for a book (I think) is something which has a
                                    beginning and an end (even if it’s not a novel, in the strict
                                    sense of the word). It is a space which the reader must enter,
                                    wander round, maybe lose his way in, and eventually find an
                                    exit, or perhaps even several exits, or maybe a way of breaking
                                    out on his own.

                            </p></blockquote> If we enter our concentric city of Leonia again immediately new
                            associative perspectives pop up. As shown in the figure above, we
                            recognize for instance Calvino’s reference to Kafka’s story of the
                            Emperor’s messenger wanting to report about the death of Kubla Kahn by
                            trying in vain to break through the walls surrounding the palace [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#kafka2012">Kafka 2012</a>]. Nowadays, the concentric rings of garbage
                            surrounding Leonia has also become symbolic for polluted, unlivable
                            cities. However, another of Calvino’s references, the one to
                            Campanella’s concentric walled “City of the Sun”
                            allows to link the form of Leonia with images of built and not built
                            fortified cities that are relevant to our two next cases focusing on the
                            impact of visualizations of imaginary and existing cities for town

                            [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#oers2000">Oers 2000</a>]. However, we will try to reveal, via the
                            zooming features of the Z-editor interface, that Stevin’s city
                            architecture was not conceived as one rational whole, but rather should
                            be read from a didactic perspective to explain a multi-layered model of
                            an ideal city and houses all based on the same underlying concept of
                            mirror-symmetry. Nowadays we are familiar with the concept of
                            mirror-symmetry, but at the time that Stevin wrote his treatise authors
                            on architecture used the term ‘symmetria’ in the Vitruvian tradition
                            i.e. as the harmonious ratio of the parts to the whole. For that reason
                            Stevin introduced the neologism: “lycksijdcheyt”,
                            literally like-sidedness. For Stevin, this distinction was not trivial.
                            But in his view, mirror-symmetry had its origins in nature, unlike the
                            proportional symmetry of Vitruvius and his followers, and should
                            therefore serve as the basis for logical architecture: <blockquote><p>
                                [...] a building should be like an animal, and
                                    if one wishes to make it correctly, one should follow nature. By
                                    which it should be understood that just as nature or the Creator
                                    of animals produces like-sidedness, so the architect should
                                    emulate this and design buildings with like-sidedness.

                            allow us to demonstrate why the relationships between Stevin’s town and
                            houses should be understood in the context of his didactic explanation
                            of the underlying principle of mirror-symmetry rather by the rational
                            arguments based on morphological correspondences between some (but not
                            all) of the buildings blocks of houses and the town. A closer look at
                            Stevin’s town plan reveals that most, but not all features can be
                            explained rationally. The rectangular ground plan with its square
                            buildings blocks enables an efficient distribution of houses and can be
                            therefore read from a civic planning perspective as rational. However,
                            the bastions with acute pointed faces and the odd double flanks from the
                            bastions adjacent to the corner bastions are compromises from a military
                            point of view. Stevin was well aware of that. In his treatise on
                            fortification, <cite class="title italic">De Sterctenbouwing</cite>
                            [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#stevin1594">Stevin 1594</a>], Stevin explained that the optimal form for
                            a large city to defend itself would be a hexagon. A comparison on level
                            1 (city) shows indeed that the hexagonal perimeter of the fortress city
                            results in bastions with more obtuse points that are less vulnerable for
                            collision after a heavy impact of gunfire. Also zooming reveals that
                            Stevin’s city cannot be read as one coherent whole. Hoeven/Louwen
                            represented Stevin’s city as a system of building components that could
                            be pieced together [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#hoeven1985">Hoeven and Louwe 1985</a>]. However, if we zoom-in
                            to 2<span class="hi superscript">nd</span> level, that represents buildings
                            blocks containing different numbers of houses, it becomes clear that as
                            a result of the variations in their rectangular form they would not all
                            fit into the square buildings blocks represented in the town plan.
                            Despite their differences, the blocks have in common that they are
                            organized in such a way that all houses receive as much light as
                            possible from the inner courts and that the rules of mirror-symmetry are
                            always respected. In short, Stevin was not interested in forms of towns
                            and dwellings in which contrasting demands of military, economic or
                            social orders were planned as one whole. Instead, Stevin’s writings on
                            the layout of houses and towns are characterized by the separation of
                            different levels and the segregation of adjacent functions. Stevin’s
                            synthesis of houses into blocks, blocks into towns and the ordering of
                            urban extensions focused more on the organizational method than on the
                            precise form. And this method was governed by a single principle: that
                            of mirror-symmetry, to which all other organizational forms were
                            subordinated. The reason why Stevin’s city has been read by many authors
                            as one systematic whole might have been enhanced by their use of its
                            representation in print in the work of Hendrik Stevin. Hendrik Stevin
                            represented his father’s city with all the names of the civic functions:
                            palace, churches, markets, university etc. engraved in the image itself.
                            This way, the image of the city could be read independently as one
                            whole. However, Hendrik Stevin’s excerpt in the manuscript version of
                            the <cite class="title italic">Huysbou</cite>, drawn after the original
                            drawings, reveals that his father’s representation of the town,
                            buildings blocks and separated houses consists of a series of diagrams
                            (including letters/numbers referred to in the descriptions) that can
                            only be understood in combination with the text and other illustrations. </div>

                            Maurice and accompanied him on all his campaigns in the first decades of
                            the Eighty Years War in the Low Countries against Spain. Although Prince
                            Maurice became Captain General of the Army and Admiral of the Fleet
                            after the assassination of his father William the Silent in 1584 when he
                            was 18 years old, his inexperience was not the only reason that his
                            uncles insisted on training him in the military arts. Training in the
                            military arts made part of the education of noblemen where elementary of
                            warfare and fortification were taught along dancing, singing, playing
                            music, drawing, fencing and of course disciplines such as mathematics,
                            physics, logic, rhetoric, and languages. On the ceiling of the Palazzo
                            dei Cinquecento in Florence, Archduke Cosimo I dei Medici is depicted
                            drawing a fortress with a compass in his hand and Stevin explained how
                            Prince Maurice developed an instrument in order to learn to draw
                            fortifications in the correct way. Knowledge of fortification drawings
                            belonged to the cultural education of noblemen and designs that once
                            played a role in the practice of building defenses for cities ended up
                            in their collections. Often they were re-used or adapted for decorations
                            of fortified cities on the walls of their palaces or to create beautiful
                            atlases. It is in this context that the atlas presented in 1624 by the
                            Flemish engineer Pierre Lepoivre (ca. 1546 – 1627) to the archdukes
                            Albert VI and Isabel of Austria, sovereigns of the Habsburg Netherlands
                            must be understood [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#heuvel1998">Heuvel 1998</a>]. At first sight,
                                    <em class="emph">“Les Plans des Villes des Païs de
                                    Hennault, d’Artois, de Breband très noblement descripts à la
                                    plume”</em>, drawn by Lepoivre between 1615-1622, seem
                            to provide trustworthy depictions of historical battles and sieges that
                            took place in the Eighty Years War in the Low Countries. A closer
                            reading of the drawings however, reveals that Lepoivre mixed his own
                            mappings of historical events with interpretations of other
                            cartographical depictions of besieged towns and unexecuted designs of
                            cities, resulting in different levels of reliability and
                            trustworthiness. This becomes clear for instance in four drawings in his
                            atlas based on designs that the Italian engineer Bartolomeo Campi
                            (?-1573) made for the city and citadel of Groningen in the Netherlands.
                            The detail of the bastion was probably directly copied after Campi’s
                            design of 1570 [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#heuvel1994">Heuvel 1994</a>]. Lepoivre included a drawing
                            after Campi’s design for a hexagonal citadel, – similar to Stevin’s
                            fortress city in the form of hexagon- but a pentagonal one was executed.
                            The third drawing shows Groningen with the hexagonal citadel that never
                            existed in that form and the fourth as a part of the Siege of Groningen
                            in 1594, when the citadel that existed was already dismantled [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#heuvel1998">Heuvel 1998</a>]. </div>

                            falsifications, however at the time of Lepoivre the mixing of sources to
                            illuminate historic events that took place apparently was not considered
                            to be problematic. Not only Lepoivre knew also the archdukes in their
                            official role of sovereigns of the Habsburg Netherlands must have known.
                            They had given Lepoivre official commission to make designs for reliable
                            fortification works and given him 500 Flemish pounds for the atlas, but
                            seem to have had no objection that the engineer selected or at least
                            included drawings based on non-executed designs or adaptations of
                            representations of historical events. The re-use in Lepoivre’s atlas of

                            through imaginary cities whose features might have inspired both
                            Calvino's literary writings as Lepoivre's designs. Contemporary artists
                            still inspired by Calvino seem to delve into a collective visual memory
                            of “cities”, in a way Renaissance engineers linked
                            their designs to representations of ideal cities and new fortress towns,
                            from Campanella's City of the Sun to Zamosz in Poland. Renaissance ideal
                            fortress cities were radial concentric cities with a polygonal perimeter
                            with angular bastions. Therefore circumscribing and inscribing circles
                            played an essential role in designing fortified cities and citadels. The
                            design of fortifications was not just functional. Training in the
                            Military Arts belonged to the education of noblemen, who often collected
                            drawings of fortifications. Fortification atlases were cultural
                            artifacts amongst other books on architecture such as the many Vitruvius
                            editions of the Renaissance that often contained antique and modern
                            visual interpretations of the city described in the lost original
                            manuscript.</div>

                            Sun allows to link the form of Leonia with images of built and not built
                            fortified cities as the designs of citadels in the atlas of Lepoivre.
                            This comparison is of interest since Calvino once considered a theme
                                “Cities and Form” as well, but decided to
                            merge it with those of other cities [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#calvino1983">Calvino 1983</a>, 38]. By extension, we can imagine a traversal through the space of city
                            forms, following multiple exploration paths and connecting imaginary
                            cities in literature (Calvino, Campanella) and in architectural
                            treatises and theory (Vitruvius) with imaginary representations of
                            existing cities in design (Lepoivre).</div>

                    </cite>onto a “rhizomatic” interpretative space. In the
                    second example, we transposed Stevin’s conceptual system of town design into a
                    scalable structure, from the level of the whole city to that of a house, to the
                    abstract layer explaining the concept of mirror-symmetry and its role as an
                    organizing principle within the whole system interpreted in this way from a
                    didactic viewpoint. An additional z-text illustrated the contextualization of
                    Stevin’s work by highlighting, via the switch of perspective from manuscript to
                    print, the differences in the visual-textual dynamics in Simon’s versus
                    Hendrik’s representations of the town plans. The third experiment dealt with a

                    only provides more detail but also allows horizontal expansion, resulting in
                    widening horizons [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#eberhardt2004">Eberhardt 2004</a>, 87–88]. The study of the
                    role of zooming in particular, and of metaphors in general, in digital
                    hermeneutics has, in our opinion, the potential for widening horizons, both in
                    terms of interpretation and of production of knowledge. Further experiments and
                    features development should be envisaged (e.g., allowing the users to have an
                    overview, reconstruct and annotate the steps they took while navigating in the
                    interpretative space provided by the digital tool and the implied metaphor).
                    Moreover, further requirements can be explored by interdisciplinary research and
                    training programs, like the Digital History and Hermeneutics Doctoral Training
                    Unit, starting in 2017 at the University of Luxembourg, intended to create a
                        “space of experiment” and to encourage “critical and self-reflexive

                    [<a class="ref" href="armaselu-metaphors.html#fickers2016">Fickers 2016</a>], in order to stimulate creative thinking and to
                    improve the exploitation of these tools and technologies for research and
                    teaching. In this context, the combined analysis of metaphor and digital
