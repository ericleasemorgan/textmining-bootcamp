        Giannina Braschi

      

        
        Giannina Braschi has been called “one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today,” by the PEN organization. Her first published work was a book of poetry, “Asalto al tiempo,” written in Spanish prose and published in Barcelona in 1980. Since then she has had critical essays, a novella and more poetry published in Spanish. In 1994, the first English translation of her collected works was published in the poetry trilogy “Empire of Dreams.” She then went on to write “Yo-Yo Boing!,” written in Spanglish. Her new book is “United States of Banana” (Amazon Crossing). Braschi is a National Endowment for the Arts fellow.
