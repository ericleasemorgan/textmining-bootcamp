	This event brought together faculty and graduate students working at the intersection of literary studies and applied computational analysis. This field has been growing for some time, but there have been few opportunities for a sustained discussion of the methodological challenges and opportunities afforded by new digital and data-driven tools and techniques. Existing work in “cultural analytics” by Lev Manovich and others provides a useful framework to think about what this research might be. In this conference, brought together scholars who specialize in a range of literatures and periods to galvanize the formation of a “cultural analytics” sub-field for textual studies specifically.
