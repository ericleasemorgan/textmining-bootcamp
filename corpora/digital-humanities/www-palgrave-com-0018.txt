                            Confronting the digital revolution in academia, this book examines the application of new computational techniques and visualisation technologies in the Arts & Humanities. Uniting differing perspectives, leading and emerging scholars discuss the theoretical and practical challenges that computation raises for these disciplines.

'Berry and colleagues present us with several current and future trajectories of the digital humanities, both building and questioning its trends. Through the last 40 years of computational research, the humanities have appropriated and developed many techniques for doing their work computationally, but only in the last ten years has the excess of computational capacity begun to bring central questions about the nature of the humanities to light. David Berry and his colleagues sit on the cutting edges of these questions, and their work will inform those debates for years to come.' - Jeremy Hunsinger, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA


'This book introduces and debates important questions regarding the use of digital technologies in numerous academic approaches in humanities and social sciences. These new media technologies are impacting across the disciplinary spectrum and pose challenges to traditional scholarship. Dr Berry's book gives us a timely insight into these various challenges and into the kinds of new 'digital humanities' that are emerging. Clearly written and providing a wide range of examples and case studies it is an important contribution to the growing literature on digital humanities.' - Christian De Cock, University of Essex, UK
