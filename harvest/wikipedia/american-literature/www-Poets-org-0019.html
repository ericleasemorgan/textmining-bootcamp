She attended Garland Junior College for one year and married Alfred Muller Sexton II at age nineteen. She enrolled in a modeling course at the Hart Agency and lived in San Francisco and Baltimore. In 1953 she gave birth to a daughter. In 1954 she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, suffered her first mental breakdown, and was admitted to Westwood Lodge, a neuropsychiatric hospital she would repeatedly return to for help. In 1955, following the birth of her second daughter, Sexton suffered another breakdown and was hospitalized again; her children were sent to live with her husband's parents. That same year, on her birthday, she attempted suicide.She was encouraged by her doctor to pursue an interest in writing poetry she had developed in high school, and in the fall of 1957 she enrolled in a poetry workshop at the Boston Center for Adult Education. In her introduction to Sexton's Complete Poems, the poet Maxine Kumin, who was enrolled with Sexton in the 1957 workshop and became her close friend, describes her belief that it was the writing of poetry that gave Sexton something to work toward and develop and thus enabled her to endure life for as long as she did. In 1974 at the age of 46, despite a successful writing career\u2014she won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1967 for Live or Die\u2014she lost her battle with mental illness and committed suicide.Like Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, W. D. Snodgrass (who exerted a great influence on her work), and other Confessional\u00a0poets, Sexton offers the reader an intimate view of the emotional anguish that characterized her life. She made the experience of being a woman a central issue in her poetry, and though she endured criticism for bringing subjects such as menstruation, abortion, and drug addiction into her work, her skill as a poet transcended the controversy over her subject matter.Selected BibliographyPoetry45 Mercy Street (1976)All My Pretty Ones (1962)Live or Die (1966)Love Poems (1969)Selected Poems (1964)The Awful Rowing Toward God (1975)The Book of Folly (1973)The Complete Poems (1981)The Death Notebooks (1974)To Bedlam and Part Way Back (1960)Transformations (1971)Words for Dr. Y.: Uncollected Poems (1978)ProseAnne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters (1977)"}</script>

The son of Palestinian refugees, he grew up in Libya and Saudi Arabia before returning to the United States for college. He attended the University of Georgia\u2013Athens, the Medical College of Georgia, and the University of Texas, where he completed his studies in internal medicine.In 2007 his first poetry collection, The Earth in the Attic (Yale University Press, 2008), was selected by Louise Gl\u00fcck as the winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets. In her foreword Gl\u00fcck writes, \u201cJoudah\u2019s model is less the allegory than the folktale, his language a language in which the anecdotal past is stored, renewed, and affirmed in the retellings. So, too, the chilling testimony of landscape becomes in language fixed, permanent, a means of both affirming and sustaining outrage.\u201dJoudah is also the author of Textu (Copper Canyon Press, 2013) and Alight (Copper Canyon Press, 2013). His translation of Mahmoud Darwish\u2019s The Butterfly\u2019s Burden (Copper Canyon Press, 2006) was a finalist for the 2008 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation, and his translation of Ghassan Zaqtan\u2019s Like a Straw Bird It Follows Me (Yale University Press, 2012), won the 2013 International Griffin Poetry Prize.Alongside his poetry, Joudah volunteers for Doctors Without Borders and serves as an ER physician. He lives in Houston, Texas.BibliographyFootnotes in the Order of Disappearance (Milkweed Editions, 2018)Textu (Copper Canyon Press, 2013)Alight (Copper Canyon Press, 2013)The Earth in the Attic (Yale University Press, 2008)"}</script>

His pseudonym Bei Dao literally means \"North Island,\" and was suggested by a friend as a reference to the poet's provenance from Northern China as well as his typical solitude.Dao was one of the foremost poets of the Misty School, and his early poems were a source of inspiration during the April Fifth Democracy Movement of 1976, a peaceful demonstration in Tiananmen Square. He has been in exile from his native China since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.His books of poetry include The Rose of Time: New and Selected Poems (New Directions, 2010); Unlock (2000); At the Sky's Edge: Poems 1991\u20131996 (1996), for which David Hinton won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets; Landscape Over Zero (1995); Forms of Distance (1994); Old Snow (1991); and The August Sleepwalker (1990). His work has been translated into over twenty-five languages.He is also the author of short stories and essays. In 1978, he and colleague Mang Ke founded the underground literary magazine Jintian (Today), which ceased publication under police order. In 1990, the magazine was revived and Bei Dao serves as the Editor-in-Chief.In his foreword to At the Sky's Edge, Michael Palmer writes: \"Anointed as an icon on the Democracy Wall and as the voice of a generation by the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989, and thereby also fated to exile, Bei Dao has followed a path of resistance that abjures overt political rhetoric while simultaneously keeping faith with his passionate belief in social reform and freedom of the creative imagination.\"His awards and honors include the Aragana Poetry Prize from the International Festival of Poetry in Casablanca, Morocco, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He has been a candidate several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was elected an honorary member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters. At the request of Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, he traveled to Palestine as part of a delegation for the International Parliament of Writers.Bei Dao was a Stanford Presidential lecturer and has taught at the University of California at Davis, the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, and Beloit College in Wisconsin. In 2006, Bei Dao was allowed to move back to China."}</script>

In 1954, she was diagnosed with postpartum depression and suffered her first mental breakdown. She was admitted to Westwood Lodge, a psychiatric hospital to which she would repeatedly return for help.Encouraged by her doctor to pursue her interest in writing, Sexton enrolled in a poetry workshop at the Boston Center for Adult Education in the fall of 1957. A year later she joined Robert Lowell's writing workshop at Boston University along with Sylvia Plath. Deeply influenced by the Confessional poems that Lowell was writing, Sexton began crafting her own intimate portraits. She quickly gained a reputation for her unusually honest poetry, and her forthright, unflinching attention to feminist themes and the body.Her most celebrated collection, Live or Die, is a fictionalized memoir of her recovery from mental illness. Each poem is dated as she moves from the opening lines of \"And One for My Dame,\" to the closing lines of \"Live.\" In the author\u2019s note, she says that the poems were written chronologically, \"despite the fact that they read like a fever chart for a bad case of melancholy.\" Although the recovery mapped within the volume was not complete, the poems do not portend her suicide in 1974, just eight years later. While there is cause for sadness in these poems, there is celebration as well.The Pulitzer Prize-winning Live or Die includes many of Sexton's most well-known poems, including \"Little Girl, My String Bean, My Lovely Woman,\" and \"Wanting to Die,\" and \"Sylvia\u2019s Death,\" in which she writes to Plath: \"Thief!--/how did you crawl into/ crawl down alone/into the death I wanted so badly and for so long.\""}</script>

The work in this collection is urgent, direct, and often reflective on the relationships between family members\u2014 although the poems are haunted with death and scenes from the past. A long multi-section prose poem \"Aunt Anna\" centers the book, and powerfully so. Mort writes, in the first section of that poem, Death, like a spoiled child to whom nobody ever said \"no,\" was already lickingthe cream off their sleeping lives, leaving behind the bland crust of their bodies.This book review originally appeared in\u00a0American Poets."}</script>

We are watching the sailboats trying to sail along without wind. Small rowboats are making their incisions on the water, only to have the wounds seal up again soon after they pass. In the background, smoke from the factories and smoke from the steamboats merges into tiny clouds above us then disappears. Our mothers and fathers walk arm in arm along the shore clutching tightly their umbrellas and canes. We are sitting on a blanket in the foreground, but even if someone were to take a photograph, only our closest relatives would recognize us: we seem to be burying our heads between our knees.I remember thinking you were one of the most delicate women I had ever seen. Your bones seemed small and fragile as a rabbit's. Even so, beads of perspiration begin to form on your wrist and forehead \u2014 if we were to live long enough we'd have been amazed at how many clothes we forced ourselves to wear. At this time I had never seen you without your petticoats, and if I ever gave thought to such a possibility I'd chastise myself for not offering you sufficient respect.The sun is very hot. Why is it no one complains of the heat in France? There are women doing their needlework, men reading, a man in a bowler hat smoking a pipe. The noise of the children is absorbed by the trees. The air is full of idleness, there is the faint aroma of lilies coming from somewhere. We discuss what we want for ourselves, abstractly, it seems only right on a day like this. I have ambitions to be a painter, and you want a small family and a cottage in the country. We make everything sound so simple because we believe everything is still possible. The small tragedies of our parents have not yet made an impression on us. We should be grateful, but we're too awkward to think hard about very much.I throw a scaling rock into the water; I have strong arms and before the rock sinks it seems to have nearly reached the other side. When we get up we have a sense of our own importance. We could not know, taking a step back, looking at the total picture, that we would occupy such a small corner of the canvas, and that even then we are no more than tiny clusters of dots, carefully placed together without touching."}</script>

Minsk is full of statues: gigantic statues to national poets along with the granite busts of communist officials. Maxim Bakhdanovich was a Belarusian modernist poet who died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-five, a couple of years after his first book was published. He was lucky to die so peacefully. In exactly twenty years most Belarusian intellectuals were tortured and murdered by the communist officials. In one night in 1937, Bolsheviks shot twenty-two young Belarusian writers. The statue of Bakhdanovich in Minsk is 4.6 meters high and is made out of granite.”<br /><em>—Valzhyna Mort</em></p></div></div></div> </div>

                                                 house by a blue harbor.</em>
                                                        —Maxim Bakhdanovich

 
Come in, Maxim!... This is Minsk
choked under a pillow of clouds.
 
There’s you: a statue in a heavy coat.
Here all monuments wear coats
 
not wool, but linden bark coats
with bee fur collars.
 
In their pockets monuments keep belts.
And under collars monuments have necks.
 
In winter shadows insulate the walls.
Windows and cracks are plucked with shadows.
In museums on display are coats
 
and nooses. And water is pickle-juice.
 
Come in, Maxim, apartment blocks
are wrapped in ammunition staircases,
and window-medals sparkle through the night.
 
Every building here is a kind of bust,
an elevator ascends like vomit.
 
Of furniture there is a stump.
Come in, Maxim,
it’s nothing like lie dying by a harbor.
 
Take a sit on a stump.
Don’t cast a shadow.
Keep the coat on.
</pre>

We did it before temple, after temple, between prayers.
The windows echoed her mantras, our cries warmed the air.
Two peaks merged, then sank below the clouds.

We did it before temple, after temple, between prayers.

Two peaks merged, then sank below the clouds.
Night and day, everything was changing.

Her stomach began to show and people asked her not to come.
My mother was all alone when I was born.
Night and day. Everything was changing.
The radio started playing rhythm and blues.
